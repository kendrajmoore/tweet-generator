PREFACE 
PREFACE 

I'd never given much thought to how I would die — though I'd had reason enough in the last few months 
— but even if I had, I would not have imagined it like this. 



I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of the hunter, and he looked 
pleasantly back at me. 

Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone I loved. Noble, even. That ought 
to count for something. 

I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be facing death now. But, terrified as I was, I couldn't 
bring myself to regret the decision. When life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations, 
it's not reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end. 

The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered forward to kill me. 
1. FIRST SIGHT 



My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down. It was seventy-five degrees in 
Phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I was wearing my favorite shirt — sleeveless, white eyelet 
lace; I was wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka. 

In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small town named Forks exists under a 
near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the 
United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother 
escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was in this town that I'd been compelled to spend 
a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these past three 
summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead. 

It was to Forks that I now exiled myself — an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks. 

I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved the vigorous, sprawling city. 

"Bella," my mom said to me — the last of a thousand times — before I got on the plane. "You don't have 
to do this." 

My mom looks like me, except with short hair and laugh lines. I felt a spasm of panic as I stared at her 
wide, childlike eyes. How could I leave my loving, erratic, harebrained mother to fend for herself? Of 
course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, 
gas in her car, and someone to call when she got lost, but still. . . 

"I want to go," I lied. I'd always been a bad liar, but I'd been saying this lie so frequently lately that it 
sounded almost convincing now. 

"TeU Charlie I said hi." 

"I will." 

"I'll see you soon," she insisted. "You can come home whenever you want — I'll come right back as soon 
as you need me." 

But I could see the sacrifice in her eyes behind the promise. 
"Don't worry about me," I urged. "It'll be great. I love you, Mom." 



She hugged me tightly for a minute, and then I got on the plane, and she was gone. 

It's a four-hour flight from Phoenix to Seattle, another hour in a small plane up to Port Angeles, and then 
an hour drive back down to Forks. Flying doesn't bother me; the hour in the car with Charlie, though, I 
was a little worried about. 

Charlie had really been fairly nice about the whole thing. He seemed genuinely pleased that I was coming 
to live with him for the first time with any degree of permanence. He'd already gotten me registered for 
high school and was going to help me get a car. 

But it was sure to be awkward with Charlie. Neither of us was what anyone would call verbose, and I 
didn't know what there was to say regardless. I knew he was more than a little confused by my decision 
— like my mother before me, I hadn't made a secret of my distaste for Forks. 

When I landed in Port Angeles, it was raining. I didn't see it as an omen — just unavoidable. I'd already 
said my goodbyes to the sun. 

Charlie was waiting for me with the cruiser. This I was expecting, too. Charlie is Police Chief Swan to the 
good people of Forks. My primary motivation behind buying a car, despite the scarcity of my funds, was 
that I refused to be driven around town in a car with red and blue lights on top. Nothing slows down 
traffic like a cop. 

Charlie gave me an awkward, one-armed hug when I stumbled my way off the plane. 

"It's good to see you, Bells," he said, smiling as he automatically caught and steadied me. "You haven't 
changed much. How's Renee?" 

"Mom's fine. It's good to see you, too, Dad." I wasn't allowed to call him Charlie to his face. 

I had only a few bags. Most of my Arizona clothes were too permeable for Washington. My mom and I 
had pooled our resources to supplement my winter wardrobe, but it was still scanty. It all fit easily into 
the trunk of the cruiser. 

"I found a good car for you, really cheap," he announced when we were strapped in. 

"What kind of car?" I was suspicious of the way he said "good car for you " as opposed to just "good 
car." 

"Well, it's a truck actually, a Chevy." 
"Where did you find it?" 

"Do you remember Billy Black down at La Push?" La Push is the tiny Indian reservation on the coast. 
"No." 

"He used to go fishing with us during the summer," Charlie prompted. 

That would explain why I didn't remember him. I do a good job of blocking painful, unnecessary things 
from my memory. 

"He's in a wheelchair now," Charlie continued when I didn't respond, "so he can't drive anymore, and he 
offered to sell me his truck cheap." 

"What year is it?" I could see from his change of expression that this was the question he was hoping I 



wouldn't ask. 



"Well, Billy's done a lot of work on the engine — it's only a few years old, really." 

I hoped he didn't think so lMe of me as to believe I would give up that easily. "When did he buy it?" 

"He bought it in 1984, 1 think." 

"Did he buy it new?" 

"Well, no. I think it was new in the early sixties — or late fifties at the earliest," he admitted sheepishly. 

"Ch — Dad, I don't really know anything about cars. I wouldn't be able to fix it if anything went wrong, 
and I couldn't afford a mechanic ..." 

"Really, Bella, the thing runs great. They don't build them like that anymore." 

The thing, I thought to myself. . . it had possibilities — as a nickname, at the very least. 

"How cheap is cheap?" After all, that was the part I couldn't compromise on. 

"Well, honey, I kind of already bought it for you. As a homecoming gift." Charlie peeked sideways at me 
with a hopeful expression. 

Wow. Free. 

"You didn't need to do that, Dad. I was going to buy myself a car." 

"I don't mind. I want you to be happy here." He was looking ahead at the road when he said this. Charlie 
wasn't comfortable with expressing his emotions out loud. I inherited that from him. So I was looking 
straight ahead as I responded. 

"That's really nice, Dad. Thanks. I really appreciate it." No need to add that my being happy in Forks is 
an impossibility. He didn't need to suffer along with me. And I never looked a free truck in the mouth — 
or engine. 

"Well, now, you're welcome," he mumbled, embarrassed by my thanks. 

We exchanged a few more comments on the weather, which was wet, and that was pretty much it for 
Conversation. We stared out the windows in silence. 

It was beautiful, of course; I couldn't deny that. Everything was green: the trees, their trunks covered with 
moss, their branches hanging with a canopy of it, the ground covered with ferns. Even the air filtered 
down greenly through the leaves. 

It was too green — an alien planet. 

Eventually we made it to Charlie's. He still lived in the small, two-bedroom house that he'd bought with 
my mother in the early days of their marriage. Those were the only kind of days their marriage had — the 
early ones. There, parked on the street in front of the house that never changed, was my new — well, 
new to me — truck. It was a faded red color, with big, rounded fenders and a bulbous cab. To my 
intense surprise, I loved it. I didn't know if it would run, but I could see myself in it. Plus, it was one of 
those solid iron affairs that never gets damaged — the kind you see at the scene of an accident, paint 
unscratched, surrounded by the pieces of the foreign car it had destroyed. 



"Wow, Dad, I love it! Thanks!" Now my horrific day tomorrow would be just that much less dreadful. I 
wouldn't be faced with the choice of either walking two miles in the rain to school or accepting a ride in 
the Chiefs cruiser. 

"I'm glad you like it," Charlie said gruffly, embarrassed again. 

It took only one trip to get all my stuff upstairs. I got the west bedroom that faced out over the front yard. 
The room was familiar; it had been belonged to me since I was bom. The wooden floor, the light blue 
walls, the peaked ceiling, the yellowed lace curtains around the window — these were all a part of my 
childhood. The only changes Charlie had ever made were switching the crib for a bed and adding a desk 
as I grew. The desk now held a secondhand computer, with the phone line for the modem stapled along 
the floor to the nearest phone jack. This was a stipulation from my mother, so that we could stay in touch 
easily. The rocking chair from my baby days was still in the comer. 

There was only one small bathroom at the top of the stairs, which I would have to share with Charlie. I 
was trying not to dwell too much on that fact. 

One of the best things about Charlie is he doesn't hover. He left me alone to unpack and get settled, a 
feat that would have been altogether impossible for my mother. It was nice to be alone, not to have to 
smile and look pleased; a relief to stare dejectedly out the window at the sheeting rain and let just a few 
tears escape. I wasn't in the mood to go on a real crying jag. I would save that for bedtime, when I 
would have to think about the corning morning. 

Forks High School had a frightening total of only three hundred and fifty-seven — now fifty-eight — 
students; there were more than seven hundred people in my junior class alone back home. All of the kids 
here had grown up together — their grandparents had been toddlers together. 

I would be the new girl from the big city, a curiosity, a freak. 

Maybe, if I looked like a girl from Phoenix should, I could work this to my advantage. But physically, I'd 
never fit in anywhere. I should be tan, sporty, blond — a volleyball player, or a cheerleader, perhaps — 
all the things that go with living in the valley of the sun. 

Instead, I was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or red hair, despite the constant 
sunshine. I had always been slender, but soft somehow, obviously not an athlete; I didn't have the 
necessary hand-eye coordination to play sports without humihating myself — and harming both myself 
and anyone else who stood too close. 

When I finished putting my clothes in the old pine dresser, I took my bag of bathroom necessities and 
went to the communal bathroom to clean myself up after the day of travel. I looked at my face in the 
mirror as I brushed through my tangled, damp hair. Maybe it was the light, but already I looked sallower, 
unhealthy. My skin could be pretty — it was very clear, almost translucent-looking — but it all depended 
on color. I had no color here. 

Facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, I was forced to admit that I was lying to myself. It wasn't just 
physically that I'd never fit in. And if I couldn't find a niche in a school with three thousand people, what 
were my chances here? 

I didn't relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth was that I didn't relate well to people, period. Even 
my mother, who I was closer to than anyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on 
exactly the same page. Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same things through my eyes that the 
rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain. But the cause didn't 
matter. All that mattered was the effect. And tomorrow would be just the beginning. 



I didn't sleep well that night, even after I was done crying. The constant whooshing of the rain and wind 
across the roof wouldn't fade into the background. I pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and later 
added the pillow, too. But I couldn't fall asleep until after midnight, when the rain finally settled into a 
quieter drizzle. 

Thick fog was all I could see out my window in the morning, and I could feel the claustrophobia creeping 
up on me. You could never see the sky here; it was like a cage. 

Breakfast with Charlie was a quiet event. He wished me good luck at school. I thanked him, knowing his 
hope was wasted. Good luck tended to avoid me. Charlie left first, off to the police station that was his 
wife and family. After he left, I sat at the old square oak table in one of the three unmatching chairs and 
examined his small kitchen, with its dark paneled walls, bright yellow cabinets, and white linoleum floor. 
Nothing was changed. My mother had painted the cabinets eighteen years ago in an attempt to bring 
some sunshine into the house. Over the small fireplace in the adjoining handkerchief-sized family room 
was a row of pictures. First a wedding picture of Charlie and my mom in Las Vegas, then one of the 
three of us in the hospital after I was bom, taken by a helpful nurse, followed by the procession of my 
school pictures up to last year's. Those were embarrassing to look at — I would have to see what I 
could do to get Charlie to put them somewhere else, at least while I was living here. 

It was impossible, being in this house, not to realize that Charlie had never gotten over my mom. It made 
me uncomfortable. 

I didn't want to be too early to school, but I couldn't stay in the house anymore. I donned my jacket — 
which had the feel of a biohazard suit — and headed out into the rain. 

It was just drizzling still, not enough to soak me through immediately as I reached for the house key that 
was always hidden under the eaves by the door, and locked up. The sloshing of my new waterproof 
boots was unnerving. I missed the normal crunch of gravel as I walked. I couldn't pause and admire my 
truck again as I wanted; I was in a hurry to get out of the misty wet that swirled around my head and 
clung to my hair under my hood. 

Inside the truck, it was nice and dry. Either Billy or Charlie had obviously cleaned it up, but the tan 
upholstered seats still smelled faintiy of tobacco, gasoline, and peppermint. The engine started quickly, to 
my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling at top volume. Well, a truck this old was bound to 
have a flaw. The antique radio worked, a plus that I hadn't expected. 

Finding the school wasn't difficult, though I'd never been there before. The school was, like most other 
things, just off the highway. It was not obvious that it was a school; only the sign, which declared it to be 
the Forks High School, made me stop. It looked like a collection of matching houses, built with 
maroon-colored bricks. There were so many trees and shrubs I couldn't see its size at first. Where was 
the feel of the institution? I wondered nostalgically. Where were the chain-link fences, the metal 
detectors? 

I parked in front of the first building, which had a small sign over the door reading front office. No one 
else was parked there, so I was sure it was off limits, but I decided I would get directions inside instead 
of circling around in the rain like an idiot. I stepped unwillingly out of the toasty truck cab and walked 
down a little stone path lined with dark hedges. I took a deep breath before opening the door. 

Inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than I'd hoped. The office was small; a little waiting area with 
padded folding chairs, orange-flecked commercial carpet, notices and awards cluttering the walls, a big 
clock ticking loudly. Plants grew everywhere in large plastic pots, as if there wasn't enough greenery 



outside. The room was cut in half by a long counter, cluttered with wire baskets full of papers and 
brightiy colored flyers taped to its front. There were three desks behind the counter, one of which was 
manned by a large, red-haired woman wearing glasses. She was wearing a purple t-shirt, which 
immediately made me feel overdressed. 

The red-haired woman looked up. "Can I help you?" 

"I'm Isabella Swan," I informed her, and saw the immediate awareness light her eyes. I was expected, a 
topic of gossip no doubt. Daughter of the Chiefs flighty ex-wife, come home at last. 

"Of course," she said. She dug through a precariously stacked pile of documents on her desk till she 
found the ones she was looking for. "I have your schedule right here, and a map of the school." She 
brought several sheets to the counter to show roe. 

She went through my classes for me, highlighting the best route to each on the map, and gave me a slip to 
have each teacher sign, which I was to bring back at the end of the day. She smiled at me and hoped, 
like Charlie, that I would like it here in Forks. I smiled back as convincingly as I could. 

When I went back out to my truck, other students were starting to arrive. I drove around the school, 
following the line of traffic. I was glad to see that most of the cars were older like mine, nothing flashy. At 
home I'd lived in one of the few lower-income neighborhoods that were included in the Paradise Valley 
District. It was a common thing to see a new Mercedes or Porsche in the student lot. The nicest car here 
was a shiny Volvo, and it stood out. Still, I cut the engine as soon as I was in a spot, so that the 
thunderous volume wouldn't draw attention to me. 

I looked at the map in the truck, trying to memorize it now; hopefully I wouldn't have to walk around with 
it stuck in front of my nose all day. I stuffed everything in my bag, slung the strap over my shoulder, and 
sucked in a huge breath. I can do this, I lied to myself feebly. No one was going to bite me. I finally 
exhaled and stepped out of the truck. 

I kept my face pulled back into my hood as I walked to the sidewalk, crowded with teenagers. My plain 
black jacket didn't stand out, I noticed with relief. 

Once I got around the cafeteria, building three was easy to spot. A large black "3" was painted on a 
white square on the east corner. I felt my breathing gradually creeping toward hyperventilation as I 
approached the door. I tried holding my breath as I followed two unisex raincoats through the door. 

The classroom was small. The people in front of me stopped just inside the door to hang up their coats 
on a long row of hooks. I copied them. They were two girls, one a porcelain-colored blonde, the other 
also pale, with light brown hair. At least my skin wouldn't be a standout here. 

I took the slip up to the teacher, a tall, balding man whose desk had a nameplate identifying him as Mr. 
Mason. He gawked at me when he saw my name — not an encouraging response — and of course I 
flushed tomato red. But at least he sent me to an empty desk at the back without introducing me to the 
class. It was harder for my new classmates to stare at me in the back, but somehow, they managed. I 
kept my eyes down on the reading list the teacher had given me. It was fairly basic: Bronte, Shakespeare, 
Chaucer, Faulkner. I'd already read everything. That was comforting. . . and boring. I wondered if my 
mom would send me my folder of old essays, or if she would think that was cheating. I went through 
different arguments with her in my head while the teacher droned on. 

When the bell rang, a nasal buzzing sound, a gangly boy with skin problems and hair black as an oil slick 
leaned across the aisle to talk to me. 



"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you?" He looked like the overly helpful, chess club type. 
"Bella," I corrected. Everyone within a three-seat radius turned to look at me. 
"Where's your next class?" he asked. 

I had to check in my bag. "Urn, Government, with Jefferson, in building six." 
There was nowhere to look without meeting curious eyes. 

"I'm headed toward building four, I could show you the way. . ." Definitely over-helpful. "I'm Eric," he 
added. 

I smiled tentatively. "Thanks." 

We got our jackets and headed out into the rain, which had picked up. I could have sworn several 
people behind us were walking close enough to eavesdrop. I hoped I wasn't getting paranoid. 

"So, this is a lot different than Phoenix, huh?" he asked. 

"Very." 

"It doesn't rain much there, does it?" 

"Three or four times a year." 

"Wow, what must that be like?" he wondered. 

"Sunny," I told him. 

"You don't look very tan." 

"My mother is part albino." 

He studied my face apprehensively, and I sighed. It looked like clouds and a sense of humor didn't mix. 
A few months of this and I'd forget how to use sarcasm. 

We walked back around the cafeteria, to the south buildings by the gym. Eric walked me right to the 
door, though it was clearly marked. 

"Well, good luck," he said as I touched the handle. "Maybe we'll have some other classes together." He 
sounded hopeful. 

I smiled at him vaguely and went inside. 

The rest of the morning passed in about the same fashion. My Trigonometry teacher, Mr. Varner, who I 
would have hated anyway just because of the subject he taught, was the only one who made me stand in 
front of the class and introduce myself. I stammered, blushed, and tripped over my own boots on the 
way to my seat. 

After two classes, I started to recognize several of the faces in each class. There was always someone 
braver than the others who would introduce themselves and ask me questions about how I was liking 
Forks. I tried to be diplomatic, but mostly I just lied a lot. At least I never needed the map. 

One girl sat next to me in both Trig and Spanish, and she walked with me to the cafeteria for lunch. She 
was tiny, several inches shorter than my five feet four inches, but her wildly curly dark hair made up a lot 



of the difference between our heights. I couldn't remember her name, so I smiled and nodded as she 
prattled about teachers and classes. I didn't try to keep up. 

We sat at the end of a full table with several of her friends, who she introduced to me. I forgot all their 
names as soon as she spoke them. They seemed impressed by her bravery in speaking to me. The boy 
from English, Eric, waved at me from across the room. 

It was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make conversation with seven curious strangers, that I first 
saw them. 

They were sitting in the comer of the cafeteria, as far away from where I sat as possible in the long room. 
There were five of them. They weren't talking, and they weren't eating, though they each had a tray of 
untouched food in front of them. They weren't gawking at me, unlike most of the other students, so it was 
safe to stare at them without fear of meeting an excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of 
these things that caught, and held, my attention. 

They didn't look anything alike. Of the three boys, one was big — muscled like a serious weight lifter, 
with dark, curly hair. Another was taller, leaner, but still muscular, and honey blond. The last was lanky, 
less bulky, with untidy, bronze-colored hair. He was more boyish than the others, who looked like they 
could be in college, or even teachers here rather than students. 

The girls were opposites. The tall one was statuesque. She had a beautiful figure, the kind you saw on the 
cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, the kind that made every girl around her take a hit on her 
self-esteem just by being in the same room. Her hair was golden, gently waving to the middle of her 
back. The short girl was pixielike, thin in the extreme, with small features. Her hair was a deep black, 
cropped short and pointing in every direction. 

And yet, they were all exactiy alike. Every one of them was chalky pale, the palest of all the students 
living in this sunless town. Paler than me, the albino. They all had very dark eyes despite the range in hair 
tones. They also had dark shadows under those eyes — purplish, bruiselike shadows. As if they were all 
suffering from a sleepless night, or almost done recovering from a broken nose. Though their noses, all 
their features, were straight, perfect, angular. 

But all this is not why I couldn't look away. 

I stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were all devastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They 
were faces you never expected to see except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine. Or 
painted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decide who was the most beautiful — 
maybe the perfect blond girl, or the bronze-haired boy. 

They were all looking away — away from each other, away from the other students, away from anything 
in particular as far as I could tell. As I watched, the small girl rose with her tray — unopened soda, 
unbitten apple — and walked away with a quick, graceful lope that belonged on a runway. I watched, 
amazed at her lithe dancer's step, till she dumped her tray and glided through the back door, faster than I 
would have thought possible. My eyes darted back to the others, who sat unchanging. 

"Who are theyT I asked the girl from my Spanish class, whose name I'd forgotten. 

As she looked up to see who I meant — though already knowing, probably, from my tone — suddenly 
he looked at her, the thinner one, the boyish one, the youngest, perhaps. He looked at my neighbor for 
just a fraction of a second, and then his dark eyes flickered to mine. 

He looked away quickly, more quickly than I could, though in a flush of embarrassment I dropped my 



eyes at once. In that brief flash of a glance, his face held nothing of interest — it was as if she had called 
his name, and he'd looked up in involuntary response, already having decided not to answer. 

My neighbor giggled in embarrassment, looking at the table like I did. 

"That's Edward and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and Jasper Hale. The one who left was Alice Cullen; 
they all live together with Dr. Cullen and his wife." She said this under her breath. 

I glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was looking at his tray now, picking a bagel to pieces with 
long, pale fingers. His mouth was moving very quickly, his perfect lips barely opening. The other three still 
looked away, and yet I felt he was speaking quietly to them. 

Strange, unpopular names, I thought. The kinds of names grandparents had. But maybe that was in vogue 
here — small town names? I finally remembered that my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly 
common name. There were two girls named Jessica in my History class back home. 

"They are. . . very nice-looking." I struggled with the conspicuous understatement. 

"Yes!" Jessica agreed with another giggle. "They're all together though — Emmett and Rosalie, and 
Jasper and Alice, I mean. And they live together." Her voice held all the shock and condemnation of the 
small town, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I had to admit that even in Phoenix, it would 
cause gossip. 

"Which ones are the Cullens?" I asked. "They don't look related. . . " 

"Oh, they're not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his twenties or early thirties. They're all adopted. The 
Hales are brother and sister, twins — the blondes — and they're foster children." 

"They look a little old for foster children." 

"They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen, but they've been with Mrs. Cullen since they were 
eight. She's their aunt or something like that." 

"That's really kind of nice — for them to take care of all those kids like that, when they're so young and 
everything." 

"I guess so," Jessica admitted reluctantly, and I got the impression that she didn't like the doctor and his 
wife for some reason. With the glances she was throwing at their adopted children, I would presume the 
reason was jealousy. "I think that Mrs. Cullen can't have any kids, though," she added, as if that lessened 
their kindness. 

Throughout all this conversation, my eyes flickered again and again to the table where the strange family 
sat. They continued to look at the walls and not eat. 

"Have they always lived in Forks?" I asked. Surely I would have noticed them on one of my summers 
here. 

"No," she said in a voice that implied it should be obvious, even to a new arrival like me. "They just 
moved down two years ago from somewhere in Alaska." 

I felt a surge of pity, and relief. Pity because, as beautiful as they were, they were outsiders, clearly not 
accepted. Relief that I wasn't the only newcomer here, and certainly not the most interesting by any 
standard. 



As I examined them, the youngest, one of the Cullens, looked up and met my gaze, this time with evident 
curiosity in his expression. As I looked swiftly away, it seemed to me that his glance held some kind of 
unmet expectation. 

"Which one is the boy with the reddish brown hair?" I asked. I peeked at him from the corner of my eye, 
and he was still staring at me, but not gawking like the other students had today — he had a slightly 
frustrated expression. I looked down again. 

"That's Edward. He's gorgeous, of course, but don't waste your time. He doesn't date. Apparently none 
of the girls here are good-looking enough for him." She sniffed, a clear case of sour grapes. I wondered 
when he'd turned her down. 

I bit my hp to hide my smile. Then I glanced at him again. His face was turned away, but I thought his 
cheek appeared lifted, as if he were smiling, too. 

After a few more minutes, the four of them left the table together. They all were noticeably graceful — 
even the big, brawny one. It was unsettling to watch. The one named Edward didn't look at me again. 

I sat at the table with Jessica and her friends longer than I would have if I'd been sitting alone. I was 
anxious not to be late for class on my first day. One of my new acquaintances, who considerately 
reminded me that her name was Angela, had Biology U with me the next hour. We walked to class 
together in silence. She was shy, too. 

When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at a black-topped lab table exactly like the ones I 
was used to. She already had a neighbor. In fact, all the tables were filled but one. Next to the center 
aisle, I recognized Edward Cullen by his unusual hair, sitting next to that single open seat. 

As I walked down the aisle to introduce myself to the teacher and get my slip signed, I was watching him 
surreptitiously. Just as I passed, he suddenly went rigid in his seat. He stared at me again, meeting my 
eyes with the strangest expression on his face — it was hostile, furious. I looked away quickly, shocked, 
going red again. I stumbled over a book in the walkway and had to catch myself on the edge of a table. 
The girl sitting there giggled. 

I'd noticed that his eyes were black — coal black. 

Mr. Banner signed my slip and handed me a book with no nonsense about introductions. I could tell we 
were going to get along. Of course, he had no choice but to send me to the one open seat in the middle 
of the room. I kept my eyes down as I went to sit by him, bewildered by the antagonistic stare he'd given 
me. 

I didn't look up as I set my book on the table and took my seat, but I saw his posture change from the 
comer of my eye. He was leaning away from me, sitting on the extreme edge of his chair and averting his 
face like he smelled something bad. Inconspicuously, I sniffed my hair. It smelled like strawberries, the 
scent of my favorite shampoo. It seemed an innocent enough odor. I let my hair fall over my right 
shoulder, making a dark curtain between us, and tried to pay attention to the teacher. 

Unfortunately the lecture was on cellular anatomy, something I'd already studied. I took notes carefully 
anyway, always looking down. 

I couldn't stop myself from peeking occasionally through the screen of my hair at the strange boy next to 
me. During the whole class, he never relaxed his stiff position on the edge of his chair, sitting as far from 
me as possible. I could see his hand on his left leg was clenched into a fist, tendons standing out under his 
pale skin. This, too, he never relaxed. He had the long sleeves of his white shirt pushed up to his elbows, 



and his forearm was surprisingly hard and muscular beneath his light skin. He wasn't nearly as slight as 
he'd looked next to his burly brother. 

The class seemed to drag on longer than the others. Was it because the day was finally coming to a 
close, or because I was waiting for his tight fist to loosen? It never did; he continued to sit so still it 
looked like he wasn't breathing. What was wrong with him? Was this his normal behavior? I questioned 
my judgment on Jessica's bitterness at lunch today. Maybe she was not as resentful as I'd thought. 

It couldn't have anything to do with me. He didn't know me from Eve. 

I peeked up at him one more time, and regretted it. He was glaring down at me again, his black eyes full 
of revulsion. As I flinched away from him, slirinking against my chair, the phrase if looks could kill 
suddenly ran through my mind. 

At that moment, the bell rang loudly, making me jump, and Edward Cullen was out of his seat. Fluidly he 
rose — he was much taller than I'd thought — his back to me, and he was out the door before anyone 
else was out of their seat. 

I sat frozen in my seat, staring blankly after him. He was so mean. It wasn't fair. I began gathering up my 
things slowly, trying to block the anger that filled me, for fear my eyes would tear up. For some reason, 
my temper was hardwired to my tear ducts. I usually cried when I was angry, a humiliating tendency. 

"Aren't you Isabella Swan?" a male voice asked. 

I looked up to see a cute, baby-faced boy, his pale blond hair carefully gelled into orderly spikes, smiling 
at me in a friendly way. He obviously didn't think I smelled bad. 

"Bella," I corrected him, with a smile. 

TmMike." 

"Hi, Mike." 

"Do you need any help finding your next class?" 
"I'm headed to the gym, actually. I think I can find it." 

"That's my next class, too." He seemed thrilled, though it wasn't that big of a coincidence in a school this 
small. 

We walked to class together; he was a chatterer — he supplied most of the conversation, which made it 
easy for me. He'd lived in California till he was ten, so he knew how I felt about the sun. It turned out he 
was in my English class also. He was the nicest person I'd met today. 

But as we were entering the gym, he asked, "So, did you stab Edward Cullen with a pencil or what? I've 
never seen him act like that." 

I cringed. So I wasn't the only one who had noticed. And, apparently, that wasn 't Edward Cullen's usual 
behavior. I decided to play dumb. 

"Was that the boy I sat next to in Biology?" I asked artlessly. 
"Yes," he said. "He looked like he was in pain or something." 
"I don't know," I responded. "I never spoke to him." 



"He's a weird guy." Mike lingered by me instead of heading to the dressing room. "If I were lucky enough 
to sit by you, I would have talked to you." 

I smiled at him before walking through the girls' locker room door. He was friendly and clearly admiring. 
But it wasn't enough to ease my irritation. 

The Gym teacher, Coach Clapp, found me a uniform but didn't make me dress down for today's class. 
At home, only two years of RE. were required. Here, P.E. was mandatory all four years. Forks was 
literally my personal hell on Earth. 

I watched four volleyball games running simultaneously. Remembering how many injuries I had sustained 
— and inflicted — playing volleyball, I felt faintly nauseated. 

The final bell rang at last. I walked slowly to the office to return my paperwork. The rain had drifted 
away, but the wind was strong, and colder. I wrapped my arms around myself. 

When I walked into the warm office, I almost turned around and walked back out. 

Edward Cullen stood at the desk in front of me. I recognized again that tousled bronze hair. He didn't 
appear to notice the sound of my entrance. I stood pressed against the back wall, waiting for the 
receptionist to be free. 

He was arguing with her in a low, attractive voice. I quickly picked up the gist of the argument. He was 
trying to trade from sixth-hour Biology to another time — any other time. 

I just couldn't believe that this was about me. It had to be something else, something that happened 
before I entered the Biology room. The look on his face must have been about another aggravation 
entirely. It was impossible that this stranger could take such a sudden, intense dislike to me. 

The door opened again, and the cold wind suddenly gusted through the room, rusthng the papers on the 
desk, swirling my hair around my face. The girl who came in merely stepped to the desk, placed a note in 
the wire basket, and walked out again. But Edward Cullen's back stiffened, and he turned slowly to glare 
at me — his face was absurdly handsome — with piercing, hate-filled eyes. For an instant, I felt a thrill of 
genuine fear, raising the hair on my arms. The look only lasted a second, but it chilled me more than the 
freezing wind. He turned back to the receptionist. 

"Never mind, then," he said hastily in a voice like velvet. "I can see that it's impossible. Thank you so 
much for your help." And he turned on his heel without another look at me, and disappeared out the 
door. 

I went meekly to the desk, my face white for once instead of red, and handed her the signed slip. 
"How did your first day go, dear?" the receptionist asked maternally. 
"Fine," I lied, my voice weak. She didn't look convinced. 

When I got to the truck, it was almost the last car in the lot. It seemed like a haven, already the closest 
thing to home I had in this damp green hole. I sat inside for a while, just staring out the windshield 
blankly. But soon I was cold enough to need the heater, so I turned the key and the engine roared to life. 
I headed back to Charlie's house, fighting tears the whole way there. 



2. OPEN BOOK 



The next day was better. . . and worse. 

It was better because it wasn't raining yet, though the clouds were dense and opaque. It was easier 
because I knew what to expect of my day. Mike came to sit by me in English, and walked me to my next 
class, with Chess Club Eric glaring at him all the while; that was nattering. People didn't look at me quite 
as much as they had yesterday. I sat with a big group at lunch that included Mike, Eric, Jessica, and 
several other people whose names and faces I now remembered. I began to feel like I was treading 
water, instead of drowning in it. 

It was worse because I was tired; I still couldn't sleep with the wind echoing around the house. It was 
worse because Mr. Varner called on me in Trig when my hand wasn't raised and I had the wrong 
answer. It was miserable because I had to play volleyball, and the one time I didn't cringe out of the way 
of the ball, I hit my teammate in the head with it. And it was worse because Edward Cullen wasn't in 
school at all. 

All morning I was dreading lunch, fearing his bizarre glares. Part of me wanted to confront him and 
demand to know what his problem was. While I was lying sleepless in my bed, I even imagined what I 
would say. But I knew myself too well to think I would really have the guts to do it. I made the Cowardly 
Lion look like the terminator. 

But when I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica — trying to keep my eyes from sweeping the place for 
him, and failing entirely — I saw that his four siblings of sorts were sitting together at the same table, and 
he was not with them. 

Mike intercepted us and steered us to his table. Jessica seemed elated by the attention, and her friends 
quickly joined us. But as I tried to listen to their easy chatter, I was terribly uncomfortable, waiting 
nervously for the moment he would arrive. I hoped that he would simply ignore me when he came, and 
prove my suspicions false. 

He didn't come, and as time passed I grew more and more tense. 

I walked to Biology with more confidence when, by the end of lunch, he still hadn't showed. Mike, who 
was taking on the qualities of a golden retriever, walked faithfully by my side to class. I held my breath at 
the door, but Edward Cullen wasn't there, either. I exhaled and went to my seat. Mike followed, talking 
about an upcoming trip to the beach. He lingered by my desk till the bell rang. Then he smiled at me 
wistfully and went to sit by a girl with braces and a bad perm. It looked like I was going to have to do 
something about Mike, and it wouldn't be easy. In a town like this, where everyone lived on top of 
everyone else, diplomacy was essential. I had never been enormously tactful; I had no practice dealing 
with overly friendly boys. 

I was relieved that I had the desk to myself, that Edward was absent. I told myself that repeatedly. But I 
couldn't get rid of the nagging suspicion that I was the reason he wasn't there. It was ridiculous, and 
egotistical, to think that I could affect anyone that strongly. It was impossible. And yet I couldn't stop 
worrying that it was true. 

When the school day was finally done, and the blush was fading out of my cheeks from the volleyball 
incident, I changed quickly back into my jeans and navy blue sweater. I hurried from the girls' locker 
room, pleased to find that I had successfully evaded my retriever friend for the moment. I walked swiftly 
out to the parking lot. It was crowded now with fleeing students. I got in my truck and dug through my 
bag to make sure I had what I needed. 

Last night I'd discovered that Charlie couldn't cook much besides fried eggs and bacon. So I requested 



that I be assigned kitchen detail for the duration of my stay. He was willing enough to hand over the keys 
to the banquet hall. I also found out that he had no food in the house. So I had my shopping list and the 
cash from the jar in the cupboard labeled FOOD MONEY, and I was on my way to the Thriftway. 

I gunned my deafening engine to life, ignoring the heads that turned in my direction, and backed carefully 
into a place in the line of cars that were waiting to exit the parking lot. As I waited, trying to pretend that 
the earsphtting rumble was coming from someone else's car, I saw the two Cullens and the Hale twins 
getting into their car. It was the shiny new Volvo. Of course. I hadn't noticed their clothes before — I'd 
been too mesmerized by their faces. Now that I looked, it was obvious that they were all dressed 
exceptionally well; simply, but in clothes that subtiy hinted at designer origins. With their remarkable good 
looks, the style with which they carried themselves, they could have worn dishrags and pulled it off. It 
seemed excessive for them to have both looks and money. But as far as I could tell, life worked that way 
most of the time. It didn't look as if it bought them any acceptance here. 

No, I didn't fully believe that. The isolation must be their desire; I couldn't imagine any door that wouldn't 
be opened by that degree of beauty. 

They looked at my noisy truck as I passed them, just like everyone else. I kept my eyes straight forward 
and was relieved when I finally was free of the school grounds. 

The Thriftway was not far from the school, just a few streets south, off the highway. It was nice to be 
inside the supermarket; it felt normal. I did the shopping at home, and I fell into the pattern of the familiar 
task gladly. The store was big enough inside that I couldn't hear the tapping of the rain on the roof to 
remind me where I was. 

When I got home, I unloaded all the groceries, stuffing them in wherever I could find an open space. I 
hoped Charlie wouldn't mind. I wrapped potatoes in foil and stuck them in the oven to bake, covered a 
steak in marinade and balanced it on top of a carton of eggs in the fridge. 

When I was finished with that, I took my book bag upstairs. Before starting my homework, I changed 
into a pair of dry sweats, pulled my damp hair up into a pony-tail, and checked my e-mail for the first 
time. I had three messages. 

"Bella," my mom wrote. . . 



Write me as soon as you get in. Tell me how your flight was. Is it raining? I miss you already. 
I'm almost finished packing for Florida, but I can't find my pink blouse. Do you know where I 
put it? Phil says hi. Mom. 



I sighed and went to the next. It was sent eight hours after the first. 
"Bella," she wrote... 



Why haven't you e-mailed me yet? What are you waiting for? Mom. 



The last was from this morning. 



Isabella, 

If I haven't heard from you by 5:30 p.m. today I'm calling Charlie. 

I checked the clock. I still had an hour, but my mom was well known for jumping the gun. 
Mom, 

Calm down. I'm writing right now. Don't do anything rash. 
Bella. 

I sent that, and began again. 
Mom, 

Everything is great. Of course it's raining. I was waiting for something to write about. School 
isn't bad, just a little repetitive. I met some nice kids who sit by me at lunch. 

Your blouse is at the dry cleaners - you were supposed to pick it up Friday. 

Charlie bought me a truck, can you believe it? I love it. It's old, but really sturdy, which is 
good, you know, for me. 

I miss you, too. I'll write again soon, but I'm not going to check my e-mail every five minutes. 
Relax, breathe. I love you. 

Bella. 

I had decided to read Wuthering Heights — the novel we were currently studying in English — yet 
again for the fun of it, and that's what I was doing when Charlie came home. I'd lost track of the time, 
and I hurried downstairs to take the potatoes out and put the steak in to broil. 

"Bella?" my father called out when he heard me on the stairs. 

Who else? I thought to myself. 

"Hey, Dad, welcome home." 

"Thanks." He hung up his gun belt and stepped out of his boots as I bustled about the kitchen. As far as I 
was aware, he'd never shot the gun on the job. But he kept it ready. When I came here as a child, he 
would always remove the bullets as soon as he walked in the door. I guess he considered me old enough 
now not to shoot myself by accident, and not depressed enough to shoot myself on purpose. 

"What's for dinner?" he asked warily. My mother was an imaginative cook, and her experiments weren't 



always edible. I was surprised, and sad, that he seemed to remember that far back. 
"Steak and potatoes," I answered, and he looked relieved. 

He seemed to feel awkward standing in the kitchen doing nothing; he lumbered into the living room to 
watch TV while I worked. We were both more comfortable that way. I made a salad while the steaks 
cooked, and set the table. 

I called him in when dinner was ready, and he sniffed appreciatively as he walked into the room. 

"Smells good, Bell." 

"Thanks." 

We ate in silence for a few minutes. It wasn't uncomfortable. Neither of us was bothered by the quiet. In 
some ways, we were well suited for living together. 

"So, how did you like school? Have you made any friends?" he asked as he was taking seconds. 

"Well, I have a few classes with a girl named Jessica. I sit with her friends at lunch. And there's this boy, 
Mike, who's very friendly. Everybody seems pretty nice." With one outstanding exception. 

"That must be Mike Newton. Nice kid — nice family. His dad owns the sporting goods store just outside 
of town. He makes a good living off all the backpackers who come through here." 

"Do you know the Cullen family?" I asked hesitantiy. 

"Dr. Cullen's family? Sure. Dr. Cullen's a great man." 

"They. . . the kids. . . are a little different. They don't seem to fit in very well at school." 
Charlie surprised me by looking angry. 

"People in this town," he muttered. "Dr. Cullen is a brilliant surgeon who could probably work in any 
hospital in the world, make ten times the salary he gets here," he continued, getting louder. "We're lucky 
to have him — lucky that his wife wanted to live in a small town. He's an asset to the community, and all 
of those kids are well behaved and polite. I had my doubts, when they first moved in, with all those 
adopted teenagers. I thought we might have some problems with them. But they're all very mature — I 
haven't had one speck of trouble from any of them. That's more than I can say for the children of some 
folks who have lived in this town for generations. And they stick together the way a family should — 
camping trips every other weekend. . . Just because they're newcomers, people have to talk." 

It was the longest speech I'd ever heard Charlie make. He must feel strongly about whatever people 
were saying. 

I backpedaled. "They seemed nice enough to me. I just noticed they kept to themselves. They're all very 
attractive," I added, trying to be more complimentary. 

"You should see the doctor," Charlie said, laughing. "It's a good thing he's happily married. A lot of the 
nurses at the hospital have a hard time concentrating on their work with him around." 

We lapsed back into silence as we finished eating. He cleared the table while I started on the dishes. He 
went back to the TV, and after I finished washing the dishes by hand — no dishwasher — I went 
upstairs unwillingly to work on my math homework. I could feel a tradition in the making. 



That night it was finally quiet. I fell asleep quickly, exhausted. 

The rest of the week was uneventful. I got used to the routine of my classes. By Friday I was able to 
recognize, if not name, almost all the students at school. In Gym, the kids on my team learned not to pass 
me the ball and to step quickly in front of me if the other team tried to take advantage of my weakness. I 
happily stayed out of their way. 

Edward Cullen didn't come back to school. 

Every day, I watched anxiously until the rest of the Cullens entered the cafeteria without him. Then I 
could relax and join in the lunchtime conversation. Mostly it centered around a trip to the La Push Ocean 
Park in two weeks that Mike was putting together. I was invited, and I had agreed to go, more out of 
politeness than desire. Beaches should be hot and dry. 

By Friday I was perfectly comfortable entering my Biology class, no longer worried that Edward would 
be there. For all I knew, he had dropped out of school. I tried not to think about him, but I couldn't 
totally suppress the worry that I was responsible for his continued absence, ridiculous as it seemed. 

My first weekend in Forks passed without incident. Charlie, unused to spending time in the usually empty 
house, worked most of the weekend. I cleaned the house, got ahead on my homework, and wrote my 
mom more bogusly cheerful e-mail. I did drive to the library Saturday, but it was so poorly stocked that I 
didn't bother to get a card; I would have to make a date to visit Olympia or Seattle soon and find a good 
bookstore. I wondered idly what kind of gas mileage the truck got. . . and shuddered at the thought. 

The rain stayed soft over the weekend, quiet, so I was able to sleep well. 

People greeted me in the parking lot Monday morning. I didn't know all their names, but I waved back 
and smiled at everyone. It was colder this morning, but happily not raining. In English, Mike took his 
accustomed seat by my side. We had a pop quiz on Wuthering Heights. It was straightforward, very 
easy. 

All in all, I was feeling a lot more comfortable than I had thought I would feel by this point. More 
comfortable than I had ever expected to feel here. 

When we walked out of class, the air was full of swirling bits of white. I could hear people shouting 
excitedly to each other. The wind bit at my cheeks, my nose. 

"Wow," Mike said. "It's snowing." 

I looked at the little cotton fluffs that were building up along the sidewalk and swirling erratically past my 
face. 

"Ew." Snow. There went my good day. 
He looked surprised. "Don't you like snow?" 

"No. That means it's too cold for rain." Obviously. "Besides, I thought it was supposed to come down in 
flakes — you know, each one unique and all that. These just look like the ends of Q-tips." 

"Haven't you ever seen snow fall before?" he asked incredulously. 

"Sure I have." I paused. "On TV." 

Mike laughed. And then a big, squishy ball of dripping snow smacked into the back of his head. We both 



turned to see where it came from. I had my suspicions about Eric, who was walking away, his back 
toward us — in the wrong direction for his next class. Mike appatently had the same notion. He bent 
over and began scraping together a pile of the white mush. 

"I'll see you at lunch, okay?" I kept walking as I spoke. "Once people start throwing wet stuff, I go 
inside." 

He just nodded, his eyes on Eric's retreating figure. 

Throughout the morning, everyone chattered excitedly about the snow; apparentiy it was the first snowfall 
of the new year. I kept my mouth shut. Sure, it was drier than rain — until it melted in your socks. 

I walked alertly to the cafeteria with Jessica after Spanish. Mush balls were flying everywhere. I kept a 
binder in my hands, ready to use it as a shield if necessary. Jessica thought I was hilarious, but something 
in my expression kept her from lobbing a snowball at me herself. 

Mike caught up to us as we walked in the doors, laughing, with ice melting the spikes in his hair. He and 
Jessica were talking animatedly about the snow fight as we got in line to buy food. I glanced toward that 
table in the comer out of habit. And then I froze where I stood. There were five people at the table. 

Jessica pulled on my arm. 

"Hello? Bella? What do you want?" 

I looked down; my ears were hot. I had no reason to feel self-conscious, I reminded myself. I hadn't 
done anything wrong. 

"What's with Bella?" Mike asked Jessica. 

"Nothing," I answered. "I'll just get a soda today." I caught up to the end of the line. 
"Aren't you hungry?" Jessica asked. 

"Actually, I feel a little sick," I said, my eyes still on the floor. 

I waited for them to get their food, and then followed them to a table, my eyes on my feet. 

I sipped my soda slowly, my stomach churning. Twice Mike asked, with unnecessary concern, how I 
was feeling. 

I told him it was nothing, but I was wondering if I should play it up and escape to the nurse's office for 
the next hour. 

Ridiculous. I shouldn't have to run away. 

I decided to permit myself one glance at the Cullen family's table. If he was glaring at me, I would skip 
Biology, like the coward I was. 

I kept my head down and glanced up under my lashes. None of them were looking this way. I lifted my 
head a little. 

They were laughing. Edward, Jasper, and Emmett all had their hair entirely saturated with melting snow. 
Alice and Rosalie were leaning away as Emmett shook his dripping hair toward them. They were 
enjoying the snowy day, just like everyone else — only they looked more like a scene from a movie than 
the rest of us. 



But, aside from the laughter and playfulness, there was something different, and I couldn't quite pinpoint 
what that difference was. I examined Edward the most carefully. His skin was less pale, I decided — 
flushed from the snow fight maybe — the circles under his eyes much less noticeable. But there was 
something more. I pondered, staring, trying to isolate the change. 

"Bella, what are you staring at?" Jessica intruded, her eyes following my stare. 

At that precise moment, his eyes flashed over to meet mine. 

I dropped my head, letting my hair fall to conceal my face. I was sure, though, in the instant our eyes met, 
that he didn't look harsh or unfriendly as he had the last time I'd seen him. He looked merely curious 
again, unsatisfied in some way. 

"Edward Cullen is staring at you," Jessica giggled in my ear. 

"He doesn't look angry, does he?" I couldn't help asking. 

"No," she said, sounding confused by my question. "Should he be?" 

"I don't think he likes me," I confided. I still felt queasy. I put my head down on my arm. 

"The Cullens don't like anybody. . . well, they don't notice anybody enough to like them. But he's still 
staring at you." 

"Stop looking at him," I hissed. 

She snickered, but she looked away. I raised my head enough to make sure that she did, contemplating 
violence if she resisted. 

Mike interrupted us then — he was planning an epic battle of the blizzard in the parking lot after school 
and wanted us to join. Jessica agreed enthusiastically. The way she looked at Mike left little doubt that 
she would be up for anything he suggested. I kept silent. I would have to hide in the gym until the parking 
lot cleared. 

For the rest of the lunch hour I very carefully kept my eyes at my own table. I decided to honor the 
bargain I'd made with myself. Since he didn't look angry, I would go to Biology. My stomach did 
frightened little flips at the thought of sitting next to him again. 

I didn't really want to walk to class with Mike as usual — he seemed to be a popular target for the 
snowball snipers — but when we went to the door, everyone besides me groaned in unison. It was 
raining, washing all traces of the snow away in clear, icy ribbons down the side of the walkway. I pulled 
my hood up, secretiy pleased. I would be free to go straight home after Gym. 

Mike kept up a string of complaints on the way to building four. 

Once inside the classroom, I saw with relief that my table was still empty. Mr. Banner was walking 
around the room, distributing one microscope and box of slides to each table. Class didn't start for a few 
minutes, and the room buzzed with conversation. I kept my eyes away from the door, doodling idly on 
the cover of my notebook. 

I heard very clearly when the chair next to me moved, but my eyes stayed carefully focused on the 
pattern I was drawing. 



"Hello," said a quiet, musical voice. 



I looked up, stunned that he was speaking to me. He was sitting as far away from me as the desk 
allowed, but his chair was angled toward me. His hair was dripping wet, disheveled — even so, he 
looked like he'd just finished shooting a commercial for hair gel. His dazzling face was friendly, open, a 
slight smile on his flawless hps. But his eyes were careful. 

"My name is Edward Cullen," he continued. "I didn't have a chance to introduce myself last week. You 
must be Bella Swan." 

My mind was spinning with confusion. Had I made up the whole thing? He was perfectly polite now. I 
had to speak; he was waiting. But I couldn't think of anything conventional to say. 

"H-how do you know my name?" I stammered. 

He laughed a soft, enchanting laugh. 

"Oh, I think everyone knows your name. The whole town's been waiting for you to arrive." 

I grimaced. I knew it was something like that. 

"No," I persisted stupidly. "I meant, why did you call me Bella?" 

He seemed confused. "Do you prefer Isabella?" 

"No, I like Bella," I said. "But I think Charlie — I mean my dad — must call me Isabella behind my back 
— that's what everyone here seems to know me as," I tried to explain, feeling like an utter moron. 

"Oh." He let it drop. I looked away awkwardly. 

Thankfully, Mr. Banner started class at that moment. I tried to concentrate as he explained the lab we 
would be doing today. The slides in the box were out of order. Working as lab partners, we had to 
separate the slides of onion root tip cells into the phases of mitosis they represented and label them 
accordingly. We weren't supposed to use our books. In twenty minutes, he would be coming around to 
see who had it right. 

"Get started," he commanded. 

"Ladies first, partner?" Edward asked. I looked up to see him smiling a crooked smile so beautiful that I 
could only stare at him like an idiot. 

"Or I could start, if you wish." The smile faded; he was obviously wondering if I was mentally competent. 
"No," I said, flushing. "I'll go ahead." 

I was showing off, just a little. I'd already done this lab, and I knew what I was looking for. It should be 
easy. I snapped the first slide into place under the microscope and adjusted it quickly to the 40X 
objective. I studied the slide briefly. 

My assessment was confident. "Prophase." 

"Do you mind if I look?" he asked as I began to remove the slide. His hand caught mine, to stop me, as 
he asked. His fingers were ice-cold, like he'd been holding them in a snowdrift before class. But that 
wasn't why I jerked my hand away so quickly. When he touched me, it stung my hand as if an electric 
current had passed through us. 



"I'm sorry," he muttered, pulling his hand back immediately. However, he continued to reach for the 



microscope. I watched him, still staggered, as he examined the slide for an even shorter time than I had. 

"Prophase," he agreed, writing it neatly in the first space on our worksheet. He swiftly switched out the 
first slide for the second, and then glanced at it cursorily. 

"Anaphase," he murmured, writing it down as he spoke. 

I kept my voice indifferent. "May I?" 

He smirked and pushed the microscope to me. 

I looked through the eyepiece eagerly, only to be disappointed. Dang it, he was right. 
"Slide three?" I held out my hand without looking at him. 

He handed it to me; it seemed like he was being careful not to touch my skin again. 
I took the most fleeting look I could manage. 

"Interphase." I passed him the microscope before he could ask for it. He took a swift peek, and then 
wrote it down. I would have written it while he looked, but his clear, elegant script intimidated me. I 
didn't want to spoil the page with my clumsy scrawl. 

We were finished before anyone else was close. I could see Mike and his partner comparing two slides 
again and again, and another group had their book open under the table. 

Which left me with nothing to do but try to not look at him. . . unsuccessfully. I glanced up, and he was 
staring at me, that same inexplicable look of frustration in his eyes. Suddenly I identified that subtie 
difference in his face. 

"Did you get contacts?" I blurted out unthinkingly. 

He seemed puzzled by my unexpected question. "No." 

"Oh," I mumbled. "I thought there was something different about your eyes." 

He shrugged, and looked away. 

In fact, I was sure there was something different. I vividly remembered the flat black color of his eyes the 
last time he'd glared at me — the color was striking against the background of his pale skin and his 
auburn hair. Today, his eyes were a completely different color: a strange ocher, darker than butterscotch, 
but with the same golden tone. I didn't understand how that could be, unless he was lying for some 
reason about the contacts. Or maybe Forks was making me crazy in the literal sense of the word. 

I looked down. His hands were clenched into hard fists again. 

Mr. Banner came to our table then, to see why we weren't working. He looked over our shoulders to 
glance at the completed lab, and then stared more intently to check the answers. 

"So, Edward, didn't you think Isabella should get a chance with the microscope?" Mr. Banner asked. 

"Bella," Edward corrected automatically. "Actually, she identified three of the five." 

Mr. Banner looked at me now; his expression was skeptical. 

"Have you done this lab before?" he asked. 



I smiled sheepishly. "Not with onion root." 

"Whitefishblastula?" 

"Yeah." 

Mr. Banner nodded. "Were you in an advanced placement program in Phoenix?" 
"Yes." 

"Well," he said after a moment, "I guess it's good you two are lab partners." He mumbled something else 
as he walked away. After he left, I began doodling on my notebook again. 

"It's too bad about the snow, isn't it?" Edward asked. I had the feeling that he was forcing himself to 
make small talk with me. Paranoia swept over me again. It was like he had heard my conversation with 
Jessica at lunch and was trying to prove me wrong. 

"Not really," I answered honestly, instead of pretending to be normal like everyone else. I was still trying 
to dislodge the stupid feeling of suspicion, and I couldn't concentrate. 

"You don't like the cold." It wasn't a question. 

"Or the wet." 

"Forks must be a difficult place for you to live," he mused. 
"You have no idea," I muttered darkly. 

He looked fascinated by what I said, for some reason I couldn't imagine. His face was such a distraction 
that I tried not to look at it any more than courtesy absolutely demanded. 

"Why did you come here, then?" 

No one had asked me that — not straight out like he did, demanding. 

"It's... complicated." 

"I think I can keep up," he pressed. 

I paused for a long moment, and then made the mistake of meeting his gaze. His dark gold eyes confused 
me, and I answered without thinking. 

"My mother got remarried," I said. 

"That doesn't sound so complex," he disagreed, but he was suddenly sympathetic. "When did that 
happen?" 

"Last September." My voice sounded sad, even to me. 
"And you don't like him," Edward surmised, his tone still kind. 
"No, Phil is fine. Too young, maybe, but nice enough." 
"Why didn't you stay with them?" 

I couldn't fathom his interest, but he continued to stare at me with penetrating eyes, as if my dull life's 



story was somehow vitally important. 

"Phil travels a lot. He plays ball for a living." I half-smiled. 

"Have I heard of him?" he asked, smiling in response. 

"Probably not. He doesn't play well. Strictly minor league. He moves around a lot." 

"And your mother sent you here so that she could travel with him." He said it as an assumption again, not 
a question. 

My chin raised a fraction. "No, she did not send me here. I sent myself." 

His eyebrows knit together. "I don't understand," he admitted, and he seemed unnecessarily frustrated by 
that fact. 

I sighed. Why was I explaining this to him? He continued to stare at me with obvious curiosity. 

"She stayed with me at first, but she missed him. It made her unhappy. . . so I decided it was time to 
spend some quality time with Charlie." My voice was glum by the time I finished. 

"But now you're unhappy," he pointed out. 

"And?" I challenged. 

"That doesn't seem fair." He shrugged, but his eyes were still intense. 
I laughed without humor. "Hasn't anyone ever told you? Life isn't fair." 
"I believe I have heard that somewhere before," he agreed dryly. 
"So that's all," I insisted, wondering why he was still staring at me that way. 

His gaze became appraising. "You put on a good show," he said slowly. "But I'd be willing to bet that 
you're suffering more than you let anyone see." 

I grimaced at him, resisting the impulse to stick out my tongue like a five-year-old, and looked away. 

"Am I wrong?" 

I tried to ignore him. 

"I didn't think so," he murmured smugly. 

"Why does it matter to you?' I asked, irritated. I kept my eyes away, watching the teacher make his 
rounds. 

"That's a very good question," he muttered, so quietiy that I wondered if he was talking to himself. 
However, after a few seconds of silence, I decided that was the only answer I was going to get. 

I sighed, scowling at the blackboard. 

"Am I annoying you?" he asked. He sounded amused. 

I glanced at him without tliinking. . . and told the truth again. "Not exactly. I'm more annoyed at myself. 
My face is so easy to read — my mother always calls me her open book." I frowned. 



"On the contrary, I find you very difficult to read." Despite everything that I'd said and he'd guessed, he 
sounded like he meant it. 

"You must be a good reader then," I replied. 

"Usually." He smiled widely, flashing a set of perfect, ultrawhite teeth. 

Mr. Banner called the class to order then, and I turned with relief to listen. I was in disbelief that I'd just 
explained my dreary life to this bizarre, beautiful boy who may or may not despise me. He'd seemed 
engrossed in our conversation, but now I could see, from the comer of my eye, that he was leaning away 
from me again, his hands gripping the edge of the table with unmistakable tension. 

I tried to appear attentive as Mr. Banner illustrated, with transparencies on the overhead projector, what 
I had seen without difficulty through the microscope. But my thoughts were unmanageable. 

When the bell finally rang, Edward rushed as swiftly and as gracefully from the room as he had last 
Monday. And, like last Monday, I stared after him in amazement. 

Mike skipped quickly to my side and picked up my books for me. I imagined him with a wagging tail. 

"That was awful," he groaned. "They all looked exactly the same. You're lucky you had Cullen for a 
partner." 

"I didn't have any trouble with it," I said, stung by his assumption. I regretted the snub instantly. "I've done 
the lab before, though," I added before he could get his feelings hurt. 

"Cullen seemed friendly enough today," he commented as we shrugged into our raincoats. He didn't seem 
pleased about it. 

I tried to sound indifferent. "I wonder what was with him last Monday." 

I couldn't concentrate on Mike's chatter as we walked to Gym, and RE. didn't do much to hold my 
attention, either. Mike was on my team today. He chivalrously covered my position as well as his own, 
so my woolgathering was only interrupted when it was my turn to serve; my team ducked warily out of 
the way every time I was up. 

The rain was just a mist as I walked to the parking lot, but I was happier when I was in the dry cab. I got 
the heater running, for once not caring about the mind-numbing roar of the engine. I unzipped my jacket, 
put the hood down, and fluffed my damp hair out so the heater could dry it on the way home. 

I looked around me to make sure it was clear. That's when I noticed the still, white figure. Edward Cullen 
was leaning against the front door of the Volvo, three cars down from me, and staring intentiy in my 
direction. I swiftly looked away and threw the truck into reverse, almost hitting a rusty Toyota Corolla in 
my haste. Lucky for the Toyota, I stomped on the brake in time. It was just the sort of car that my truck 
would make scrap metal of. I took a deep breath, still looking out the other side of my car, and 
cautiously pulled out again, with greater success. I stared straight ahead as I passed the Volvo, but from 
a peripheral peek, I would swear I saw him laughing. 

3. PHENOMENON 



When I opened my eyes in the morning, something was different. 



It was the light. It was still the gray-green light of a cloudy day in the forest, but it was clearer somehow. I 
realized there was no fog veiling my window. 

I jumped up to look outside, and then groaned in horror. 

A fine layer of snow covered the yard, dusted the top of my truck, and whitened the road. But that 
wasn't the worst part. All the rain from yesterday had frozen solid — coating the needles on the trees in 
fantastic, gorgeous patterns, and making the driveway a deadly ice slick. I had enough trouble not falling 
down when the ground was dry; it might be safer for me to go back to bed now. 

Charlie had left for work before I got downstairs. In a lot of ways, living with Charlie was like having my 
own place, and I found myself reveling in the aloneness instead of being lonely. 

I threw down a quick bowl of cereal and some orange juice from the carton. I felt excited to go to 
school, and that scared me. I knew it wasn't the stimulating learning environment I was anticipating, or 
seeing my new set of friends. If I was being honest with myself, I knew I was eager to get to school 
because I would see Edward Cullen. And that was very, very stupid. 

I should be avoiding him entirely after my brainless and embarrassing babbling yesterday. And I was 
suspicious of him; why should he lie about his eyes? I was still frightened of the hostility I sometimes felt 
emanating from him, and I was still tongue-tied whenever I pictured his perfect face. I was well aware 
that my league and his league were spheres that did not touch. So I shouldn't be at all anxious to see him 
today. 

It took every ounce of my concentration to make it down the icy brick driveway alive. I almost lost my 
balance when I finally got to the truck, but I managed to cling to the side mirror and save myself. Clearly, 
today was going to be nightmarish. 

Driving to school, I distracted myself from my fear of falling and my unwanted speculations about 
Edward Cullen by thinking about Mike and Eric, and the obvious difference in how teenage boys 
responded to me here. I was sure I looked exactly the same as I had in Phoenix. Maybe it was just that 
the boys back home had watched me pass slowly through all the awkward phases of adolescence and 
still thought of me that way. Perhaps it was because I was a novelty here, where novelties were few and 
far between. Possibly my crippling clumsiness was seen as endearing rather than pathetic, casting me as a 
damsel in distress. Whatever the reason, Mike's puppy dog behavior and Eric's apparent rivalry with him 
were disconcerting. I wasn't sure if I didn't prefer being ignored. 

My truck seemed to have no problem with the black ice that covered the roads. I drove very slowly, 
though, not wanting to carve a path of destruction through Main Street. 

When I got out of my truck at school, I saw why I'd had so little trouble. Something silver caught my eye, 
and I walked to the back of the truck — carefully holding the side for support — to examine my tires. 
There were thin chains crisscrossed in diamond shapes around them. Charlie had gotten up who knows 
how early to put snow chains on my truck. My throat suddenly felt tight. I wasn't used to being taken 
care of, and Charlie's unspoken concern caught me by surprise. 

I was standing by the back comer of the truck, struggling to fight back the sudden wave of emotion the 
snow chains had brought on, when I heard an odd sound. 

It was a high-pitched screech, and it was fast becoming painfully loud. I looked up, startled. 

I saw several things simultaneously. Nothing was moving in slow motion, the way it does in the movies. 
Instead, the adrenaline rush seemed to make my brain work much faster, and I was able to absorb in 



clear detail several things at once. 



Edward Cullen was standing four cars down from me, staring at me in horror. His face stood out from a 
sea of faces, all frozen in the same mask of shock. But of more immediate importance was the dark blue 
van that was skidding, tires locked and squealing against the brakes, spinning wildly across the ice of the 
parking lot. It was going to hit the back corner of my truck, and I was standing between them. I didn't 
even have time to close my eyes. 

Just before I heard the shattering crunch of the van folding around the truck bed, something hit me, hard, 
but not from the direction I was expecting. My head cracked against the icy blacktop, and I felt 
something solid and cold pinning me to the ground. I was lying on the pavement behind the tan car I'd 
parked next to. But I didn't have a chance to notice anything else, because the van was still coming. It 
had curled gratingly around the end of the truck and, still spinning and sliding, was about to collide with 
me again. 

A low oath made me aware that someone was with me, and the voice was impossible not to recognize. 
Two long, white hands shot out protectively in front of me, and the van shuddered to a stop a foot from 
my face, the large hands fitting providentially into a deep dent in the side of the van's body. 

Then his hands moved so fast they blurred. One was suddenly gripping under the body of the van, and 
something was dragging me, swinging my legs around like a rag doll's, till they hit the tire of the tan car. A 
groaning metallic thud hurt my ears, and the van settled, glass popping, onto the asphalt — exactly 
where, a second ago, my legs had been. 

It was absolutely silent for one long second before the screaming began. In the abrupt bedlam, I could 
hear more than one person shouting my name. But more clearly than all the yelling, I could hear Edward 
Cullen's low, frantic voice in my ear. 

"Bella? Are you all right?" 

"I'm fine." My voice sounded strange. I tried to sit up, and realized he was holding me against the side of 
his body in an iron grasp. 

"Be careful," he warned as I struggled. "I think you hit your head pretty hard." 
I became aware of a throbbing ache centered above my left ear. 
"Ow," I said, surprised. 

"That's what I thought." His voice, amazingly, sounded like he was suppressing laughter. 

"How in the. . . " I trailed off, trying to clear my head, get my bearings. "How did you get over here so 
fast?" 

"I was standing right next to you, Bella," he said, his tone serious again. 

I turned to sit up, and this time he let me, releasing his hold around my waist and sliding as far from me as 
he could in the Umited space. I looked at his concerned, innocent expression and was disoriented again 
by the force of his gold-colored eyes. What was I asking him? 

And then they found us, a crowd of people with tears streaming down their faces, shouting at each other, 
shouting at us. 

"Don't move," someone instructed. 



"Get Tyler out of the van!" someone else shouted. 

There was a flurry of activity around us. I tried to get up, but Edward's cold hand pushed my shoulder 
down. 

"Just stay put for now." 

"But it's cold," I complained. It surprised me when he chuckled under his breath. There was an edge to 
the sound. 

"You were over there," I suddenly remembered, and his chuckle stopped short. "You were by your car." 
His expression turned hard. "No, I wasn't." 

"I saw you." All around us was chaos. I could hear the gruffer voices of adults arriving on the scene. But I 
obstinately held on to our argument; I was right, and he was going to admit it. 

"Bella, I was standing with you, and I pulled you out of the way." He unleashed the full, devastating 
power of his eyes on me, as if trying to communicate something crucial. 

"No." I set my jaw. 

The gold in his eyes blazed. "Please, Bella." 
"Why?" I demanded. 

"Trust me," he pleaded, his soft voice overwhelming. 

I could hear the sirens now. "Will you promise to explain everything to me later?" 
"Fine," he snapped, abruptly exasperated. 
"Fine," I repeated angrily. 

It took six EMTs and two teachers — Mr. Varner and Coach Clapp — to shift the van far enough away 
from us to bring the stretchers in. Edward vehemently refused his, and I tried to do the same, but the 
traitor told them I'd hit my head and probably had a concussion. I almost died of humiliation when they 
put on the neck brace. It looked like the entire school was there, watching soberly as they loaded me in 
the back of the ambulance. Edward got to ride in the front. It was maddening. 

To make matters worse, Chief Swan arrived before they could get me safely away. 

"Bella!" he yelled in panic when he recognized me on the stretcher. 

"I'm completely fine, Char — Dad," I sighed. "There's nothing wrong with me." 

He turned to the closest EMT for a second opinion. I tuned him out to consider the jumble of inexplicable 
images churning chaotically in my head. When they'd lifted me away from the car, I had seen the deep 
dent in the tan car's bumper — a very distinct dent that fit the contours of Edward's shoulders. . . as if he 
had braced himself against the car with enough force to damage the metal frame. . . 

And then there was his family, looking on from the distance, with expressions that ranged from 
disapproval to fury but held no hint of concern for their brother's safety. 

I tried to think of a logical solution that could explain what I had just seen — a solution that excluded the 



assumption that I was insane. 

Naturally, the ambulance got a police escort to the county hospital. I felt ridiculous the whole time they 
were unloading me. What made it worse was that Edward simply glided through the hospital doors under 
his own power. I ground my teeth together. 

They put me in the emergency room, a long room with a line of beds separated by pastel-patterned 
curtains. A nurse put a pressure cuff on my arm and a thermometer under my tongue. Since no one 
bothered pulling the curtain around to give me some privacy, I decided I wasn't obligated to wear the 
stupid-looking neck brace anymore. When the nurse walked away, I quickly unfastened the Velcro and 
threw it under the bed. 

There was another flurry of hospital personnel, another stretcher brought to the bed next to me. I 
recognized Tyler Crowley from my Government class beneath the bloodstained bandages wrapped 
tightly around his head. Tyler looked a hundred times worse than I felt. But he was staring anxiously at 
me. 

"Bella, I'm so sorry!" 

"I'm fine, Tyler — you look awful, are you all right?" As we spoke, nurses began unwinding his soiled 
bandages, exposing a myriad of shallow slices all over his forehead and left cheek. 

He ignored me. "I thought I was going to kill you! I was going too fast, and I hit the ice wrong. . . " He 
winced as one nurse started dabbing at his face. 

"Don't worry about it; you missed me." 

"How did you get out of the way so fast? You were there, and then you were gone. . . " 
"Umm. . . Edward pulled me out of the way." 
He looked confused. "Who?" 

"Edward Cullen — he was standing next to me." I'd always been a terrible liar; I didn't sound convincing 
at all. 

"Cullen? I didn't see him. . . wow, it was all so fast, I guess. Is he okay?" 

"I think so. He's here somewhere, but they didn't make him use a stretcher." 

I knew I wasn't crazy. What had happened? There was no way to explain away what I'd seen. 

They wheeled me away then, to X-ray my head. I told them there was nothing wrong, and I was right. 
Not even a concussion. I asked if I could leave, but the nurse said I had to talk to a doctor first. So I was 
trapped in the ER, waiting, harassed by Tyler's constant apologies and promises to make it up to me. No 
matter how many times I tried to convince him I was fine, he continued to torment himself. Finally, I 
closed my eyes and ignored him. He kept up a remorseful mumbling. 

"Is she sleeping?" a musical voice asked. My eyes flew open. 

Edward was standing at the foot of my bed, smirking. I glared at him. It wasn't easy — it would have 
been more natural to ogle. 

"Hey, Edward, I'm really sorry — " Tyler began. 



Edward lifted a hand to stop him. 

"No blood, no foul," he said, flashing his brilliant teeth. He moved to sit on the edge of Tyler's bed, facing 
me. He smirked again. 

"So, what's the verdict?" he asked me. 

"There's nothing wrong with me at all, but they won't let me go," I complained. "How come you aren't 
strapped to a gurney like the rest of us?" 

"It's all about who you know," he answered. "But don't worry, I came to spring you." 

Then a doctor walked around the comer, and my mouth fell open. He was young, he was blond. . . and 
he was handsomer than any movie star I'd ever seen. He was pale, though, and tired-looking, with circles 
under his eyes. From Charlie's description, this had to be Edward's father. 

"So, Miss Swan," Dr. Cullen said in a remarkably appealing voice, "how are you feeling?" 

"I'm fine," I said, for the last time, I hoped. 

He walked to the lightboard on the wall over my head, and turned it on. 

"Your X-rays look good," he said. "Does your head hurt? Edward said you hit it pretty hard." 

"It's fine," I repeated with a sigh, throwing a quick scowl toward Edward. 

The doctor's cool fingers probed lightly along my skull. He noticed when I winced. 

"Tender?" he asked. 

"Not really." I'd had worse. 

I heard a chuckle, and looked over to see Edward's patronizing smile. My eyes narrowed. 

"Well, your father is in the waiting room — you can go home with him now. But come back if you feel 
dizzy or have trouble with your eyesight at all." 

"Can't I go back to school?" I asked, imagining Charlie trying to be attentive. 

"Maybe you should take it easy today." 

I glanced at Edward. "Does he get to go to school?" 

"Someone has to spread the good news that we survived," Edward said smugly. 
"Actually," Dr. Cullen corrected, "most of the school seems to be in the waiting room." 
"Oh no," I moaned, covering my face with my hands. 
Dr. Cullen raised his eyebrows. "Do you want to stay?" 

"No, no!" I insisted, throwing my legs over the side of the bed and hopping down quickly. Too quickly 
— I staggered, and Dr. Cullen caught me. He looked concerned. 

"I'm fine," I assured him again. No need to tell him my balance problems had nothing to do with hitting my 
head. 



"Take some Tylenol for the pain," he suggested as he steadied me. 
"It doesn't hurt that bad," I insisted. 

"It sounds like you were extremely lucky," Dr. Cullen said, smiling as he signed my chart with a flourish. 

"Lucky Edward happened to be standing next to me," I amended with a hard glance at the subject of my 
statement. 

"Oh, well, yes," Dr. Cullen agreed, suddenly occupied with the papers in front of him. Then he looked 
away, at Tyler, and walked to the next bed. My intuition flickered; the doctor was in on it. 

"I'm afraid that you '11 have to stay with us just a little bit longer," he said to Tyler, and began checking his 
cuts. 

As soon as the doctor's back was turned, I moved to Edward's side. 

"Can I talk to you for a minute?" I hissed under my breath. He took a step back from me, his jaw 
suddenly clenched. 

"Your father is waiting for you," he said through his teeth. 
I glanced at Dr. Cullen and Tyler. 

"I'd like to speak with you alone, if you don't mind," I pressed. 

He glared, and then turned his back and strode down the long room. I nearly had to run to keep up. As 
soon as we turned the comer into a short hallway, he spun around to face me. 

"What do you want?" he asked, sounding annoyed. His eyes were cold. 

His unfriendliness intimidated me. My words came out with less severity than I'd intended. "You owe me 
an explanation," I reminded him. 

"I saved your life — I don't owe you anything." 

I flinched back from the resentment in his voice. "You promised." 

"Bella, you hit your head, you don't know what you're talking about." His tone was cutting. 

My temper flared now, and I glared defiantly at him. "There's nothing wrong with my head." 

He glared back. "What do you want from me, Bella?" 

"I want to know the truth," I said. "I want to know why I'm lying for you." 

"What do you think happened?" he snapped. 

It came out in a rush. 

"All I know is that you weren't anywhere near me — Tyler didn't see you, either, so don't tell me I hit my 
head too hard. That van was going to crush us both — and it didn't, and your hands left dents in the side 
of it — and you left a dent in the other car, and you're not hurt at all — and the van should have smashed 
my legs, but you were holding it up. . . " I could hear how crazy it sounded, and I couldn't continue. I was 
so mad I could feel the tears coming; I tried to force them back by grinding my teeth together. 



He was staring at me incredulously. But his face was tense, defensive. 

"You think I lifted a van off you?" His tone questioned my sanity, but it only made me more suspicious. It 
was like a perfectiy delivered line by a skilled actor. 

I merely nodded once, jaw tight. 

"Nobody will believe that, you know." His voice held an edge of derision now. 

"I'm not going to tell anybody." I said each word slowly, carefully controlling my anger. 

Surprise flitted across his face. "Then why does it matter?" 

"It matters to me," I insisted. "I don't like to lie — so there'd better be a good reason why I'm doing it." 

"Can't you just thank me and get over it?" 

"Thank you." I waited, fuming and expectant. 

"You're not going to let it go, are you?" 

"No." 

"In that case. . . I hope you enjoy disappointment." 

We scowled at each other in silence. I was the first to speak, trying to keep myself focused. I was in 
danger of being distracted by his livid, glorious face. It was like trying to stare down a destroying angel. 

"Why did you even bother?" I asked frigidly. 

He paused, and for a brief moment his stunning face was unexpectedly vulnerable. 

"I don't know," he whispered. 

And then he turned his back on me and walked away. 

I was so angry, it took me a few minutes until I could move. When I could walk, I made my way slowly 
to the exit at the end of the hallway. 

The waiting room was more unpleasant than I'd feared. It seemed like every face I knew in Forks was 
there, staring at me. Charlie rushed to my side; I put up my hands. 

"There's nothing wrong with me," I assured him sullenly. I was still aggravated, not in the mood for 
chitchat. 

"What did the doctor say?" 

"Dr. Cullen saw me, and he said I was fine and I could go home." I sighed. Mike and Jessica and Eric 
were all there, beginning to converge on us. "Let's go," I urged. 

Charlie put one arm behind my back, not quite touching me, and led me to the glass doors of the exit. I 
waved sheepishly at my friends, hoping to convey that they didn't need to worry anymore. It was a huge 
relief — the first time I'd ever felt that way — to get into the cruiser. 

We drove in silence. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I barely knew Charlie was there. I was 
positive that Edward's defensive behavior in the hall was a confirmation of the bizarre things I still could 



hardly believe I'd witnessed. 



When we got to the house, Charlie finally spoke. 

"Um. . . you'll need to call Renee." He hung his head, guilty. 

I was appalled. "You told Mom!" 

"Sorry." 

I slammed the cruiser's door a little harder than necessary on my way out. 

My mom was in hysterics, of course. I had to tell her I felt fine at least thirty times before she would calm 
down. She begged me to come home — forgetting the fact that home was empty at the moment — but 
her pleas were easier to resist than I would have thought. I was consumed by the mystery Edward 
presented. And more than a little obsessed by Edward himself. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I wasn't as eager 
to escape Forks as I should be, as any normal, sane person would be. 

I decided I might as well go to bed early that night. Charlie continued to watch me anxiously, and it was 
getting on my nerves. I stopped on my way to grab three Tylenol from the bathroom. They did help, and, 
as the pain eased, I drifted to sleep. 

That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen. 
4. INVITATIONS 



In my dream it was very dark, and what dim light there was seemed to be radiating from Edward's skin. I 
couldn't see his face, just his back as he walked away from me, leaving me in the blackness. No matter 
how fast I ran, I couldn't catch up to him; no matter how loud I called, he never turned. Troubled, I woke 
in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep again for what seemed like a very long time. After that, he 
was in my dreams nearly every night, but always on the periphery, never within reach. 

The month that followed the accident was uneasy, tense, and, at first, embarrassing. 

To my dismay, I found myself the center of attention for the rest of that week. Tyler Crowley was 
impossible, following me around, obsessed with making amends to me somehow. I tried to convince him 
what I wanted more than anything else was for him to forget all about it — especially since nothing had 
actually happened to me — but he remained insistent. He followed me between classes and sat at our 
now-crowded lunch table. Mike and Eric were even less friendly toward him than they were to each 
other, which made me worry that I'd gained another unwelcome fan. 

No one seemed concerned about Edward, though I explained over and over that he was the hero — 
how he had pulled me out of the way and had nearly been crushed, too. I tried to be convincing. Jessica, 
Mike, Eric, and everyone else always commented that they hadn't even seen him there till the van was 
pulled away. 

I wondered to myself why no one else had seen him standing so far away, before he was suddenly, 
impossibly saving my life. With chagrin, I realized the probable cause — no one else was as aware of 
Edward as I always was. No one else watched him the way I did. How pitiful. 

Edward was never surrounded by crowds of curious bystanders eager for his firsthand account. People 



avoided him as usual. The Cullens and the Hales sat at the same table as always, not eating, talking only 
among themselves. None of them, especially Edward, glanced my way anymore. 

When he sat next to me in class, as far from me as the table would allow, he seemed totally unaware of 
my presence. Only now and then, when his fists would suddenly ball up — skin stretched even whiter 
over the bones — did I wonder if he wasn't quite as oblivious as he appeared. 

He wished he hadn't pulled me from the path of Tyler's van — there was no other conclusion I could 
come to. 

I wanted very much to talk to him, and the day after the accident I tried. The last time I'd seen him, 
outside the ER, we'd both been so furious. I still was angry that he wouldn't trust me with the truth, even 
though I was keeping my part of the bargain flawlessly. But he had in fact saved my life, no matter how 
he'd done it. And, overnight, the heat of my anger faded into awed gratitude. 

He was already seated when I got to Biology, looking straight ahead. I sat down, expecting him to turn 
toward me. He showed no sign that he realized I was there. 

"Hello, Edward," I said pleasantly, to show him I was going to behave myself. 

He turned his head a fraction toward me without meeting my gaze, nodded once, and then looked the 
other way. 

And that was the last contact I'd had with him, though he was there, a foot away from me, every day. I 
watched him sometimes, unable to stop myself — from a distance, though, in the cafeteria or parking lot. I 
watched as his golden eyes grew perceptibly darker day by day. But in class I gave no more notice that 
he existed than he showed toward me. I was miserable. And the dreams continued. 

Despite my outright lies, the tenor of my e-mails alerted Renee to my depression, and she called a few 
times, worried. I tried to convince her it was just the weather that had me down. 

Mike, at least, was pleased by the obvious coolness between me and my lab partner. I could see he'd 
been worried that Edward's daring rescue might have impressed me, and he was relieved that it seemed 
to have the opposite effect. He grew more confident, sitting on the edge of my table to talk before 
Biology class started, ignoring Edward as completely as he ignored us. 

The snow washed away for good after that one dangerously icy day. Mike was disappointed he'd never 
gotten to stage his snowball fight, but pleased that the beach trip would soon be possible. The rain 
continued heavily, though, and the weeks passed. 

Jessica made me aware of another event looming on the horizon — she called the first Tuesday of March 
to ask my permission to invite Mike to the girls' choice spring dance in two weeks. 

"Are you sure you don't mind. . . you weren't planning to ask him?" she persisted when I told her I didn't 
mind in the least. 

"No, Jess, I'm not going," I assured her. Dancing was glaringly outside my range of abilities. 

"It will be really fun." Her attempt to convince me was halfhearted. I suspected that Jessica enjoyed my 
inexplicable popularity more than my actual company. 

"You have fun with Mike," I encouraged. 

The next day, I was surprised that Jessica wasn't her usual gushing self in Trig and Spanish. She was 



silent as she walked by my side between classes, and I was afraid to ask her why. If Mike had turned her 
down, I was the last person she would want to tell. 

My fears were strengthened during lunch when Jessica sat as far from Mike as possible, chatting 
animatedly with Eric. Mike was unusually quiet. 

Mike was still quiet as he walked me to class, the uncomfortable look on his face a bad sign. But he 
didn't broach the subject until I was in my seat and he was perched on my desk. As always, I was 
electrically aware of Edward sitting close enough to touch, as distant as if he were merely an invention of 
my imagination. 

"So," Mike said, looking at the floor, "Jessica asked me to the spring dance." 

"That's great." I made my voice bright and enthusiastic. "You'll have a lot of fun with Jessica." 

"Well. . . " He floundered as he examined my smile, clearly not happy with my response. "I told her I had 
to think about it." 

"Why would you do that?" I let disapproval color my tone, though I was relieved he hadn't given her an 
absolute no. 

His face was bright red as he looked down again. Pity shook my resolve. 
"I was wondering if. . . well, if you might be planning to ask me." 

I paused for a moment, hating the wave of guilt that swept through me. But I saw, from the comer of my 
eye, Edward's head tilt reflexively in my direction. 

"Mike, I think you should tell her yes," I said. 

"Did you already ask someone?" Did Edward notice how Mike's eyes flickered in his direction? 
"No," I assured him. "I'm not going to the dance at all." 
"Why not?" Mike demanded. 

I didn't want to get into the safety hazards that dancing presented, so I quickly made new plans. 

"I'm going to Seattle that Saturday," I explained. I needed to get out of town anyway — it was suddenly 
the perfect time to go. 

"Can't you go some other weekend?" 

"Sorry, no," I said. "So you shouldn't make Jess wait any longer — it's rude." 

"Yeah, you're right," he mumbled, and turned, dejected, to walk back to his seat. I closed my eyes and 
pressed my fingers to my temples, trying to push the guilt and sympathy out of my head. Mr. Banner 
began talking. I sighed and opened my eyes. 

And Edward was staring at me curiously, that same, familiar edge of frustration even more distinct now in 
his black eyes. 

I stared back, surprised, expecting him to look quickly away. But instead he continued to gaze with 
probing intensity into my eyes. There was no question of me looking away. My hands started to shake. 



"Mr. Cullen?" the teacher called, seeking the answer to a question that I hadn't heard. 

"The Krebs Cycle," Edward answered, seeming reluctant as he turned to look at Mr. Banner. 

I looked down at my book as soon as his eyes released me, trying to find my place. Cowardly as ever, I 
shifted my hair over my right shoulder to hide my face. I couldn't believe the rush of emotion pulsing 
through me — just because he'd happened to look at me for the first time in a half-dozen weeks. I 
couldn't allow him to have this level of influence over me. It was pathetic. More than pathetic, it was 
unhealthy. 

I tried very hard not to be aware of him for the rest of the hour, and, since that was impossible, at least 
not to let him know that I was aware of him. When the bell rang at last, I turned my back to him to gather 
my things, expecting him to leave immediately as usual. 

"Bella?" His voice shouldn't have been so familiar to me, as if I'd known the sound of it all my life rather 
than for just a few short weeks. 

I turned slowly, unwillingly. I didn't want to feel what I knew I would feel when I looked at his 
too-perfect face. My expression was wary when I finally turned to him; his expression was unreadable. 
He didn't say anything. 

"What? Are you speaking to me again?" I finally asked, an unintentional note of petulance in my voice. 
His hps twitched, fighting a smile. "No, not really," he admitted. 

I closed my eyes and inhaled slowly through my nose, aware that I was gritting my teeth. He waited. 

"Then what do you want, Edward?" I asked, keeping my eyes closed; it was easier to talk to him 
coherentiy that way. 

"I'm sorry." He sounded sincere. "I'm being very rude, I know. But it's better this way, really." 

I opened my eyes. His face was very serious. 

"I don't know what you mean," I said, my voice guarded. 

"It's better if we're not friends," he explained. "Trust me." 

My eyes narrowed. I'd heard that before. 

"It's too bad you didn't figure that out earlier," I hissed through my teeth. "You could have saved yourself 
all this regret." 

"Regret?" The word, and my tone, obviously caught him off guard. "Regret for what?" 
"For not just letting that stupid van squish me." 
He was astonished. He stared at me in disbelief. 

When he finally spoke, he almost sounded mad. "You think I regret saving your life?" 

"I know you do," I snapped. 

"You don't know anything." He was definitely mad. 

I turned my head sharply away from him, clenching my jaw against all the wild accusations I wanted to 



hurl at him. I gathered my books together, then stood and walked to the door. I meant to sweep 
dramatically out of the room, but of course I caught the toe of my boot on the door jamb and dropped 
my books. I stood there for a moment, thinking about leaving them. Then I sighed and bent to pick them 
up. He was there; he'd already stacked them into a pile. He handed them to me, his face hard. 

"Thank you," I said icily. 

His eyes narrowed. 

"You're welcome," he retorted. 

I straightened up swiftly, turned away from him again, and stalked off to Gym without looking back. 

Gym was brutal. We'd moved on to basketball. My team never passed me the ball, so that was good, 
but I fell down a lot. Sometimes I took people with me. Today I was worse than usual because my head 
was so filled with Edward. I tried to concentrate on my feet, but he kept creeping back into my thoughts 
just when I really needed my balance. 

It was a relief, as always, to leave. I almost ran to the truck; there were just so many people I wanted to 
avoid. The truck had suffered only minimal damage in the accident. I'd had to replace the taillights, and if 
I'd had a real paint job, I would have touched that up. Tyler's parents had to sell their van for parts. 

I almost had a stroke when I rounded the comer and saw a tall, dark figure leaning against the side of my 
truck. Then I realized it was just Eric. I started walking again. 

"Hey, Eric," I called. 

"Hi, Bella." 

"What's up?" I said as I was unlocking the door. I wasn't paying attention to the uncomfortable edge in 
his voice, so his next words took me by surprise. 

"Uh, I was just wondering. . . if you would go to the spring dance with me?" His voice broke on the last 
word. 

"I thought it was girls' choice," I said, too startled to be diplomatic. 
"Well, yeah," he admitted, shamefaced. 

I recovered my composure and tried to make my smile warm. "Thank you for asking me, but I'm going to 
be in Seattle that day." 

"Oh," he said. "Well, maybe next time." 

"Sure," I agreed, and then bit my hp. I wouldn't want him to take that too literally. 
He slouched off, back toward the school. I heard a low chuckle. 

Edward was walking past the front of my truck, looking straight forward, his hps pressed together. I 
yanked the door open and jumped inside, slamming it loudly behind me. I revved the engine deafeningly 
and reversed out into the aisle. Edward was in his car already, two spaces down, sliding out smoothly in 
front of me, cutting me off. He stopped there — to wait for his family; I could see the four of them 
walking this way, but still by the cafeteria. I considered taking out the rear of his shiny Volvo, but there 
were too many witnesses. I looked in my rearview mirror. A line was beginning to form. Directly behind 
me, Tyler Crowley was in his recently acquired used Sentra, waving. I was too aggravated to 



acknowledge him. 

While I was sitting there, looking everywhere but at the car in front of me, I heard a knock on my 
passenger side window. I looked over; it was Tyler. I glanced back in my rearview mirror, confused. His 
car was still running, the door left open. I leaned across the cab to crank the window down. It was stiff. I 
got it halfway down, then gave up. 

"I'm sorry, Tyler, I'm stuck behind Cullen." I was annoyed — obviously the holdup wasn't my fault. 
"Oh, I know — I just wanted to ask you something while we're trapped here." He grinned. 
This could not be happening. 
"Will you ask me to the spring dance?" he continued. 

"I'm not going to be in town, Tyler." My voice sounded a little sharp. I had to remember it wasn't his fault 
that Mike and Eric had already used up my quota of patience for the day. 

"Yeah, Mike said that," he admitted. 

"Then why—" 

He shrugged. "I was hoping you were just letting him down easy." 
Okay, it was completely his fault. 

"Sorry, Tyler," I said, working to hide my irritation. "I really am going out of town." 
"That's cool. We still have prom." 

And before I could respond, he was walking back to his car. I could feel the shock on my face. I looked 
forward to see Alice, Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper all sliding into the Volvo. In his rearview mirror, 
Edward's eyes were on me. He was unquestionably shaking with laughter, as if he'd heard every word 
Tyler had said. My foot itched toward the gas pedal. . . one little bump wouldn't hurt any of them, just that 
glossy silver paint job. I revved the engine. 

But they were all in, and Edward was speeding away. I drove home slowly, carefully, muttering to myself 
the whole way. 

When I got home, I decided to make chicken enchiladas for dinner. It was a long process, and it would 
keep me busy. While I was simmering the onions and chilies, the phone rang. I was almost afraid to 
answer it, but it might be Charlie or my mom. 

It was Jessica, and she was jubilant; Mike had caught her after school to accept her invitation. I 
celebrated with her briefly while I stirred. She had to go, she wanted to call Angela and Lauren to tell 
them. I suggested — with casual innocence — that maybe Angela, the shy girl who had Biology with me, 
could ask Eric. And Lauren, a standoffish girl who had always ignored me at the lunch table, could ask 
Tyler; I'd heard he was still available. Jess thought that was a great idea. Now that she was sure of Mike, 
she actually sounded sincere when she said she wished I would go to the dance. I gave her my Seattle 
excuse. 

After I hung up, I tried to concentrate on dinner — dicing the chicken especially; I didn't want to take 
another trip to the emergency room. But my head was spinning, trying to analyze every word Edward 
had spoken today. What did he mean, it was better if we weren't friends? 



My stomach twisted as I realized what he must have meant. He must see how absorbed I was by him; he 
must not want to lead me on. . . so we couldn't even be friends. . . because he wasn't interested in me at 
all. 

Of course he wasn't interested in me, I thought angrily, my eyes stinging — a delayed reaction to the 
onions. I wasn't interesting. And he was. Interesting. . . and brilliant. . . and mysterious. . . and perfect. . . 
and beautiful. . . and possibly able to lift full-sized vans with one hand. 

Well, that was fine. I could leave him alone. I would leave him alone. I would get through my 
self-imposed sentence here in purgatory, and then hopefully some school in the Southwest, or possibly 
Hawaii, would offer me a scholarship. I focused my thoughts on sunny beaches and palm trees as I 
finished the enchiladas and put them in the oven. 

Charlie seemed suspicious when he came home and smelled the green peppers. I couldn't blame him — 
the closest edible Mexican food was probably in southern California. But he was a cop, even if just a 
small-town cop, so he was brave enough to take the first bite. He seemed to like it. It was fun to watch 
as he slowly began trusting me in the kitchen. 

"Dad?" I asked when he was almost done. 

"Yeah, Bella?" 

"Urn, I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to Seattle for the day a week from Saturday. . . if that's 
okay?" I didn't want to ask permission — it set a bad precedent — but I felt rude, so I tacked it on at 
the end. 

"Why?" He sounded surprised, as if he were unable to imagine something that Forks couldn't offer. 

"Well, I wanted to get few books — the library here is pretty limited — and maybe look at some 
clothes." I had more money than I was used to having, since, thanks to Charlie, I hadn't had to pay for a 
car. Not that the truck didn't cost me quite a bit in the gas department. 

"That truck probably doesn't get very good gas mileage," he said, echoing my thoughts. 

"I know, I'll stop in Montesano and Olympia — and Tacoma if I have to." 

"Are you going all by yourself?" he asked, and I couldn't tell if he was suspicious I had a secret boyfriend 
or just worried about car trouble. 

"Yes." 

"Seattle is a big city — you could get lost," he fretted. 

"Dad, Phoenix is five times the size of Seattle — and I can read a map, don't worry about it." 
"Do you want me to come with you?" 
I tried to be crafty as I hid my horror. 

"That's all right, Dad, I'll probably just be in dressing rooms all day — very boring." 

"Oh, okay." The thought of sitting in women's clothing stores for any period of time immediately put him 
off. 

"Thanks." I smiled at him. 



"Will you be back in time for the dance?" 

Grrr. Only in a town this small would a. father know when the high school dances were. 

"No — I don't dance, Dad." He, of all people, should understand that — I didn't get my balance 
problems from my mother. 

He did understand. "Oh, that's right," he realized. 

The next morning, when I pulled into the parking lot, I deliberately parked as far as possible from the 
silver Volvo. I didn't want to put myself in the path of too much temptation and end up owing him a new 
car. Getting out of the cab, I fumbled with my key and it fell into a puddle at my feet. As I bent to get it, a 
white hand flashed out and grabbed it before I could. I jerked upright. Edward Cullen was right next to 
me, leaning casually against my truck. 

"How do you do that?" I asked in amazed irritation. 

"Do what?" He held my key out as he spoke. As I reached for it, he dropped it into my palm. 
"Appear out of thin air." 

"Bella, it's not my fault if you are exceptionally unobservant." His voice was quiet as usual — velvet, 
muted. 

I scowled at his perfect face. His eyes were light again today, a deep, golden honey color. Then I had to 
look down, to reassemble my now-tangled thoughts. 

"Why the traffic jam last night?" I demanded, still looking away. "I thought you were supposed to be 
pretending I don't exist, not irritating me to death." 

"That was for Tyler's sake, not mine. I had to give him his chance." He snickered. 

"You. . ." I gasped. I couldn't think of a bad enough word. It felt like the heat of my anger should 
physically bum him, but he only seemed more amused. 

"And I'm not pretending you don't exist," he continued. 

"So you are trying to irritate me to death? Since Tyler's van didn't do the job?" 

Anger flashed in his tawny eyes. His hps pressed into a hard line, all signs of humor gone. 

"Bella, you are utterly absurd," he said, his low voice cold. 

My palms tingled — I wanted so badly to hit something. I was surprised at myself. I was usually a 
nonviolent person. I turned my back and started to walk away. 

"Wait," he called. I kept walking, sloshing angrily through the rain. But he was next to me, easily keeping 
pace. 

"I'm sorry, that was rude," he said as we walked. I ignored him. "I'm not saying it isn't true," he continued, 
"but it was rude to say it, anyway." 

"Why won't you leave me alone?" I grumbled. 

"I wanted to ask you something, but you sidetracked me," he chuckled. He seemed to have recovered 



his good humor. 

"Do you have a multiple personality disorder?" I asked severely. 
"You're doing it again." 

I sighed. "Fine then. What do you want to ask?" 

"I was wondering if, a week from Saturday — you know, the day of the spring dance — " 

"Are you trying to be funny ?" I interrupted him, wheeling toward him. My face got drenched as I looked 
up at his expression. 

His eyes were wickedly amused. "Will you please allow me to finish?" 

I bit my hp and clasped my hands together, interlocking my fingers, so I couldn't do anything rash. 
"I heard you say you were going to Seattle that day, and I was wondering if you wanted a ride." 
That was unexpected. 

"What?" I wasn't sure what he was getting at. 
"Do you want a ride to Seattle?" 
"With who?" I asked, mystified. 

"Myself, obviously." He enunciated every syllable, as if he were talking to someone mentally 
handicapped. 

I was still stunned. " Why?' 

"Well, I was planning to go to Seattle in the next few weeks, and, to be honest, I'm not sure if your truck 
can make it." 

"My truck works just fine, thank you very much for your concern." I started to walk again, but I was too 
surprised to maintain the same level of anger. 

"But can your truck make it there on one tank of gas?" He matched my pace again. 
"I don't see how that is any of your business." Stupid, shiny Volvo owner. 
"The wasting of finite resources is everyone's business." 

"Honestly, Edward." I felt a thrill go through me as I said his name, and I hated it. "I can't keep up with 
you. I thought you didn't want to be my friend." 

"I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be." 

"Oh, thanks, now that's all cleared up." Heavy sarcasm. I realized I had stopped walking again. We 
were under the shelter of the cafeteria roof now, so I could more easily look at his face. Which certainly 
didn't help my clarity of thought. 

"It would be more. . . prudent for you not to be my friend," he explained. "But I'm tired of trying to stay 
away from you, Bella." 



His eyes were gloriously intense as he uttered that last sentence, his voice smoldering. I couldn't 
remember how to breathe. 

"Will you go with me to Seattle?" he asked, still intense. 

I couldn't speak yet, so I just nodded. 

He smiled briefly, and then his face became serious. 

"You really should stay away from me," he warned. "I'll see you in class." 

He turned abruptly and walked back the way we'd come. 

5. BLOOD TYPE 

I made my way to English in a daze. I didn't even realize when I first walked in that class had already 
started. 

"Thank you for joining us, Miss Swan," Mr. Mason said in a disparaging tone. 
I flushed and hurried to my seat. 

It wasn't till class ended that I realized Mike wasn't sitting in his usual seat next to me. I felt a twinge of 
guilt. But he and Eric both met me at the door as usual, so I figured I wasn't totally unforgiven. Mike 
seemed to become more himself as we walked, gaining enthusiasm as he talked about the weather report 
for this weekend. The rain was supposed to take a minor break, and so maybe his beach trip would be 
possible. I tried to sound eager, to make up for disappointing him yesterday. It was hard; rain or no rain, 
it would still only be in the high forties, if we were lucky. 

The rest of the morning passed in a blur. It was difficult to believe that I hadn't just imagined what 
Edward had said, and the way his eyes had looked. Maybe it was just a very convincing dream that I'd 
confused with reality. That seemed more probable than that I really appealed to him on any level. 

So I was impatient and frightened as Jessica and I entered the cafeteria. I wanted to see his face, to see if 
he'd gone back to the cold, indifferent person I'd known for the last several weeks. Or if, by some 
miracle, I'd really heard what I thought I'd heard this morning. Jessica babbled on and on about her 
dance plans — Lauren and Angela had asked the other boys and they were all going together — 
completely unaware of my inattention. 

Disappointment flooded through me as my eyes unerringly focused on his table. The other four were 
there, but he was absent. Had he gone home? I followed the still-babbling Jessica through the line, 
crushed. I'd lost my appetite — I bought nothing but a bottle of lemonade. I just wanted to go sit down 
and sulk. 

"Edward Cullen is staring at you again," Jessica said, finally breaking through my abstraction with his 
name. "I wonder why he's sitting alone today." 

My head snapped up. I followed her gaze to see Edward, smiling crookedly, staring at me from an empty 
table across the cafeteria from where he usually sat. Once he'd caught my eye, he raised one hand and 
motioned with his index finger for me to join him. As I stared in disbelief, he winked. 



"Does he mean youT Jessica asked with insulting astonishment in her voice. 

"Maybe he needs help with his Biology homework," I muttered for her benefit. "Urn, I'd better go see 
what he wants." 

I could feel her staring after me as I walked away. 

When I reached his table, I stood behind the chair across from him, unsure. 
"Why don't you sit with me today?" he asked, smiling. 

I sat down automatically, watching him with caution. He was still smiling. It was hard to believe that 
someone so beautiful could be real. I was afraid that he might disappear in a sudden puff of smoke, and I 
would wake up. 

He seemed to be waiting for me to say something. 
"This is different," I finally managed. 

"Well. . ." He paused, and then the rest of the words followed in a rush. "I decided as long as I was going 
to hell, I might as well do it thoroughly." 

I waited for him to say something that made sense. The seconds ticked by. 
"You know I don't have any idea what you mean," I eventually pointed out. 

"I know." He smiled again, and then he changed the subject. "I think your friends are angry with me for 
stealing you." 

"They'll survive." I could feel their stares boring into my back. 

"I may not give you back, though," he said with a wicked glint in his eyes. 

I gulped. 

He laughed. "You look worried." 

"No," I said, but, ridiculously, my voice broke. "Surprised, actually. . . what brought all this on?" 

"I told you — I got tired of trying to stay away from you. So I'm giving up." He was still smiling, but his 
ocher eyes were serious. 

"Giving up?" I repeated in confusion. 

"Yes — giving up trying to be good. I'm just going to do what I want now, and let the chips fall where 
they may." His smile faded as he explained, and a hard edge crept into his voice. 

"You lost me again." 

The breathtaking crooked smile reappeared. 

"I always say too much when I'm talking to you — that's one of the problems." 
"Don't worry — I don't understand any of it," I said wryly. 
"I'm counting on that." 



"So, in plain English, are we friends now?" 
"Friends. . . " he mused, dubious. 
"Or not," I muttered. 

He grinned. "Well, we can try, I suppose. But I'm warning you now that I'm not a good friend for you." 
Behind his smile, the warning was real. 

"You say that a lot," I noted, trying to ignore the sudden trembling in my stomach and keep my voice 
even. 

"Yes, because you're not listening to me. I'm still waiting for you to believe it. If you're smart, you'll avoid 
me." 

"I think you've made your opinion on the subject of my intellect clear, too." My eyes narrowed. 
He smiled apologetically. 

"So, as long as I'm being. . . not smart, we'll try to be friends?" I struggled to sum up the confusing 
exchange. 

"That sounds about right." 

I looked down at my hands wrapped around the lemonade bottle, not sure what to do now. 
"What are you thinking?" he asked curiously. 

I looked up into his deep gold eyes, became befuddled, and, as usual, blurted out the truth. 
"I'm trying to figure out what you are." 

His jaw tightened, but he kept his smile in place with some effort. 
"Are you having any luck with that?" he asked in an offhand tone. 
"Not too much," I admitted. 
He chuckled. "What are your theories?" 

I blushed. I had been vacillating during the last month between Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker. There 
was no way I was going to own up to that. 

"Won't you tell me?" he asked, tilting his head to one side with a shockingly tempting smile. 

I shook my head. "Too embarrassing." 

"That's really frustrating, you know," he complained. 

"No," I disagreed quickly, my eyes narrowing, "I can't imagine why that would be frustrating at all — 
just because someone refuses to tell you what they're thinking, even if all the while they're making cryptic 
little remarks specifically designed to keep you up at night wondering what they could possibly mean. . . 
now, why would that be frustrating?" 

He grimaced. 



"Or better," I continued, the pent-up annoyance flowing freely now, "say that person also did a wide 
range of bizarre things — from saving your life under impossible circumstances one day to treating you 
like a pariah the next, and he never explained any of that, either, even after he promised. That, also, 
would be very non-frustrating." 

"You've got a bit of a temper, don't you?" 

"I don't like double standards." 

We stared at each other, unsmiling. 

He glanced over my shoulder, and then, unexpectedly, he snickered. 
"What?" 

"Your boyfriend seems to think I'm being unpleasant to you — he's debating whether or not to come 
break up our fight." He snickered again. 

"I don't know who you're talking about," I said frostily. "But I'm sure you're wrong, anyway." 
"I'm not. I told you, most people are easy to read." 
"Except me, of course." 

"Yes. Except for you." His mood shifted suddenly; his eyes turned brooding. "I wonder why that is." 

I had to look away from the intensity of his stare. I concentrated on unscrewing the lid of my lemonade. I 
took a swig, staring at the table without seeing it. 

"Aren't you hungry?" he asked, distracted. 

"No." I didn't feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full — of butterflies. "You?" I looked at 
the empty table in front of him. 

"No, I'm not hungry." I didn't understand his expression — it looked like he was enjoying some private 
joke. 

"Can you do me a favor?" I asked after a second of hesitation. 
He was suddenly wary. "That depends on what you want." 
"It's not much," I assured him. 
He waited, guarded but curious. 

"I just wondered. . . if you could warn me beforehand the next time you decide to ignore me for my own 
good. Just so I'm prepared." I looked at the lemonade bottle as I spoke, tracing the circle of the opening 
with my pinkie finger. 

"That sounds fair." He was pressing his hps together to keep from laughing when I looked up. 
"Thanks." 

"Then can I have one answer in return?" he demanded. 
"One." 



"Tell me one theory." 
Whoops. "Not that one." 

"You didn't qualify, you just promised one answer," he reminded me. 
"And you've broken promises yourself," I reminded him back. 
"Just one theory — I won't laugh." 
"Yes, you will." I was positive about that. 

He looked down, and then glanced up at me through his long black lashes, his ocher eyes scorching. 

"Please?" he breathed, leaning toward me. 

I blinked, my mind going blank. Holy crow, how did he do that? 

"Er, what?" I asked, dazed. 

"Please tell me just one little theory." His eyes still smoldered at me. 

"Um, well, bitten by a radioactive spider?" Was he a hypnotist, too? Or was I just a hopeless pushover? 

"That's not very creative," he scoffed. 

"I'm sorry, that's all I've got," I said, miffed. 

"You're not even close," he teased. 

"No spiders?" 

"Nope." 

"And no radioactivity?" 
"None." 

"Dang," I sighed. 

"Kryptonite doesn't bother me, either," he chuckled. 

"You're not supposed to laugh, remember?" 

He struggled to compose his face. 

"I'll figure it out eventually," I warned him. 

"I wish you wouldn't try." He was serious again. 

"Because... ?" 

"What if I'm not a superhero? What if I'm the bad guy?" He smiled playfully, but his eyes were 
impenetrable. 

"Oh," I said, as several things he'd hinted fell suddenly into place. "I see." 



"Do you?" His face was abruptly severe, as if he were afraid that he'd accidentally said too much. 

"You're dangerous?" I guessed, my pulse quickening as I intuitively realized the truth of my own words. 
He was dangerous. He'd been trying to tell me that all along. 

He just looked at me, eyes full of some emotion I couldn't comprehend. 

"But not bad," I whispered, shaking my head. "No, I don't believe that you're bad." 

"You're wrong." His voice was almost inaudible. He looked down, stealing my bottle lid and then 
spinning it on its side between his fingers. I stared at him, wondering why I didn't feel afraid. He meant 
what he was saying — that was obvious. But I just felt anxious, on edge. . . and, more than anything else, 
fascinated. The same way I always felt when I was near him. 

The silence lasted until I noticed that the cafeteria was almost empty. 

I jumped to my feet. "We're going to be late." 

"I'm not going to class today," he said, twirling the lid so fast it was just a blur. 
"Why not?" 

"It's healthy to ditch class now and then." He smiled up at me, but his eyes were still troubled. 
"Well, I'm going," I told him. I was far too big a coward to risk getting caught. 
He turned his attention back to his makeshift top. "I'll see you later, then." 

I hesitated, torn, but then the first bell sent me hurrying out the door — with a last glance corifirrning that 
he hadn't moved a centimeter. 

As I half-ran to class, my head was spinning faster than the bottle cap. So few questions had been 
answered in comparison to how many new questions had been raised. At least the rain had stopped. 

I was lucky; Mr. Banner wasn't in the room yet when I arrived. I settled quickly into my seat, aware that 
both Mike and Angela were staring at me. Mike looked resentful; Angela looked surprised, and slightly 
awed. 

Mr. Banner came in the room then, calling the class to order. He was juggling a few small cardboard 
boxes in his arms. He put them down on Mike's table, telling him to start passing them around the class. 

"Okay, guys, I want you all to take one piece from each box," he said as he produced a pair of rubber 
gloves from the pocket of his lab jacket and pulled them on. The sharp sound as the gloves snapped into 
place against his wrists seemed ominous to me. "The first should be an indicator card," he went on, 
grabbing a white card with four squares marked on it and displaying it. "The second is a four-pronged 
applicator — " he held up something that looked like a nearly toothless hair pick " — and the third is a 
sterile micro-lancet." He held up a small piece of blue plastic and split it open. The barb was invisible 
from this distance, but my stomach flipped. 

"I'll be coming around with a dropper of water to prepare your cards, so please don't start until I get to 
you." He began at Mike's table again, carefully putting one drop of water in each of the four squares. 
"Then I want you to carefully prick your finger with the lancet. . . " He grabbed Mike's hand and jabbed 
the spike into the tip of Mike's middle finger. Oh no. Clammy moisture broke out across my forehead. 

"Put a small drop of blood on each of the prongs." He demonstrated, squeezing Mike's finger till the 



blood flowed. I swallowed convulsively, my stomach heaving. 

"And then apply it to the card," he finished, holding up the dripping red card for us to see. I closed my 
eyes, trying to hear through the ringing in my ears. 

"The Red Cross is having a blood drive in Port Angeles next weekend, so I thought you should all know 
your blood type." He sounded proud of himself. "Those of you who aren't eighteen yet will need a 
parent's permission — I have slips at my desk." 

He continued through the room with his water drops. I put my cheek against the cool black tabletop and 
tried to hold on to my consciousness. All around me I could hear squeals, complaints, and giggles as my 
classmates skewered their fingers. I breathed slowly in and out through my mouth. 

"Bella, are you all right?" Mr. Banner asked. His voice was close to my head, and it sounded alarmed. 

"I already know my blood type, Mr. Banner," I said in a weak voice. I was afraid to raise my head. 

"Are you feeling faint?" 

"Yes, sir," I muttered, internally kicking myself for not ditching when I had the chance. 

"Can someone take Bella to the nurse, please?" he called. 

I didn't have to look up to know that it would be Mike who volunteered. 

"Can you walk?" Mr. Banner asked. 

"Yes," I whispered. Just let me get out of here, I thought. I'll crawl. 

Mike seemed eager as he put his arm around my waist and pulled my arm over his shoulder. I leaned 
against him heavily on the way out of the classroom. 

Mike towed me slowly across campus. When we were around the edge of the cafeteria, out of sight of 
building four in case Mr. Banner was watching, I stopped. 

"Just let me sit for a minute, please?" I begged. 

He helped me sit on the edge of the walk. 

"And whatever you do, keep your hand in your pocket," I warned. I was still so dizzy. I slumped over on 
my side, putting my cheek against the freezing, damp cement of the sidewalk, closing my eyes. That 
seemed to help a little. 

"Wow, you're green, Bella," Mike said nervously. 
"Bella?" a different voice called from the distance. 
No! Please let me be imagining that horribly familiar voice. 

"What's wrong — is she hurt?" His voice was closer now, and he sounded upset. I wasn't imagining it. I 
squeezed my eyes shut, hoping to die. Or, at the very least, not to throw up. 

Mike seemed stressed. "I think she's fainted. I don't know what happened, she didn't even stick her 
finger." 

"Bella." Edward's voice was right beside me, relieved now. "Can you hear me?" 



"No," I groaned. "Go away." 
He chuckled. 

"I was taking her to the nurse," Mike explained in a defensive tone, "but she wouldn't go any farther." 
"I'll take her," Edward said. I could hear the smile still in his voice. "You can go back to class." 
"No," Mike protested. "I'm supposed to do it." 

Suddenly the sidewalk disappeared from beneath me. My eyes flew open in shock. Edward had 
scooped me up in his arms, as easily as if I weighed ten pounds instead of a hundred and ten. 

"Put me down!" Please, please let me not vomit on him. He was walking before I was finished talking. 

"Hey!" Mike called, already ten paces behind us. 

Edward ignored him. "You look awful," he told me, grinning. 

"Put me back on the sidewalk," I moaned. The rocking movement of his walk was not helping. He held 
me away from his body, gingerly, supporting all my weight with just his arms — it didn't seem to bother 
him 

"So you faint at the sight of blood?" he asked. This seemed to entertain him. 

I didn't answer. I closed my eyes again and fought the nausea with all my strength, clamping my hps 
together. 

"And not even your own blood," he continued, enjoying himself. 

I don't know how he opened the door while carrying me, but it was suddenly warm, so I knew we were 
inside. 

"Oh my," I heard a female voice gasp. 
"She fainted in Biology," Edward explained. 

I opened my eyes. I was in the office, and Edward was striding past the front counter toward the nurse's 
door. Ms. Cope, the redheaded front office receptionist, ran ahead of him to hold it open. The 
grandmotherly nurse looked up from a novel, astonished, as Edward swung me into the room and placed 
me gentiy on the crackly paper that covered the brown vinyl mattress on the one cot. Then he moved to 
stand against the wall as far across the narrow room as possible. His eyes were bright, excited. 

"She's just a little faint," he reassured the startled nurse. "They're blood typing in Biology." 

The nurse nodded sagely. "There's always one." 

He muffled a snicker. 

"Just he down for a minute, honey; it'll pass." 

"I know," I sighed. The nausea was already fading. 

"Does this happen a lot?" she asked. 

"Sometimes," I admitted. Edward coughed to hide another laugh. 



"You can go back to class now," she told him. 

"I'm supposed to stay with her." He said this with such assured authority that — even though she pursed 
her hps — the nurse didn't argue it further. 

"El go get you some ice for your forehead, dear," she said to me, and then bustled out of the room. 
"You were right," I moaned, letting my eyes close. 
"I usually am — but about what in particular this time?" 
"Ditching is healthy." I practiced breathing evenly. 

"You scared me for a minute there," he admitted after a pause. His tone made it sound like he was 
confessing a humiliating weakness. "I thought Newton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the 
woods." 

"Ha ha." I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal every minute. 

"Honestly — I've seen corpses with better color. I was concerned that I might have to avenge your 
murder." 

"Poor Mike. I'll bet he's mad." 

"He absolutely loathes me," Edward said cheerfully. 

"You can't know that," I argued, but then I wondered suddenly if he could. 

"I saw his face — I could tell." 

"How did you see me? I thought you were ditching." I was almost fine now, though the queasiness would 
probably pass faster if I'd eaten something for lunch. On the other hand, maybe it was lucky my stomach 
was empty. 

"I was in my car, listening to a CD." Such a normal response — it surprised me. 

I heard the door and opened my eyes to see the nurse with a cold compress in her hand. 

"Here you go, dear." She laid it across my forehead. "You're looking better," she added. 

"I think I'm fine," I said, sitting up. Just a little ringing in my ears, no spinning. The mint green walls stayed 
where they should. 

I could see she was about to make me lie back down, but the door opened just then, and Ms. Cope 
stuck her head in. 

"We've got another one," she warned. 

I hopped down to free up the cot for the next invalid. 

I handed the compress back to the nurse. "Here, I don't need this." 

And then Mike staggered through the door, now supporting a sallow-looking Lee Stephens, another boy 
in our Biology class. Edward and I drew back against the wall to give them room. 

"Oh no," Edward muttered. "Go out to the office, Bella." 



I looked up at him, bewildered. 
"Trust me — go." 

I spun and caught the door before it closed, darting out of the infirmary. I could feel Edward right behind 
me. 

"You actually listened to me." He was stunned. 

"I smelled the blood," I said, wrinkling my nose. Lee wasn't sick from watching other people, like me. 
"People can't smell blood," he contradicted. 

"Well, I can — that's what makes me sick. It smells like rust. . . and salt." 
He was staring at me with an unfathomable expression. 
"What?" I asked. 
"It's nothing." 

Mike came through the door then, glancing from me to Edward. The look he gave Edward confirmed 
what Edward had said about loathing. He looked back at me, his eyes glum. 

"You look better," he accused. 

"Just keep your hand in your pocket," I warned him again. 

"It's not bleeding anymore," he muttered. "Are you going back to class?" 

"Are you kidding? I'd just have to turn around and come back." 

"Yeah, I guess. . . So are you going this weekend? To the beach?" While he spoke, he flashed another 
glare toward Edward, who was standing against the cluttered counter, motionless as a sculpture, staring 
off into space. 

I tried to sound as friendly as possible. "Sure, I said I was in." 

"We're meeting at my dad's store, at ten." His eyes flickered to Edward again, wondering if he was giving 
out too much information. His body language made it clear that it wasn't an open invitation. 

"I'll be there," I promised. 

"I'll see you in Gym, then," he said, moving uncertainly toward the door. 

"See you," I replied. He looked at me once more, his round face slightiy pouting, and then as he walked 
slowly through the door, his shoulders slumped. A swell of sympathy washed over me. I pondered seeing 
his disappointed face again. . . in Gym. 

"Gym," I groaned. 

"I can take care of that." I hadn't noticed Edward moving to my side, but he spoke now in my ear. "Go 
sit down and look pale," he muttered. 

That wasn't a challenge; I was always pale, and my recent swoon had left a light sheen of sweat on my 
face. I sat in one of the creaky folding chairs and rested my head against the wall with my eyes closed. 



Fainting spells always exhausted me. 

I heard Edward speaking softly at the counter. 

"Ms. Cope?" 

"Yes?" I hadn't heard her return to her desk. 

"Bella has Gym next hour, and I don't think she feels well enough. Actually, I was thinking I should take 
her home now. Do you think you could excuse her from class?" His voice was like melting honey. I could 
imagine how much more overwhelming his eyes would be. 

"Do you need to be excused, too, Edward?" Ms. Cope fluttered. Why couldn't I do that? 
"No, I have Mrs. Goff, she won't mind." 

"Okay, it's all taken care of. You feel better, Bella," she called to me. I nodded weakly, hamming it up 
just a bit. 

"Can you walk, or do you want me to carry you again?" With his back to the receptionist, his expression 
became sarcastic. 

"Ill walk." 

I stood carefully, and I was still fine. He held the door for me, his smile polite but his eyes mocking. I 
walked out into the cold, fine mist that had just begun to fall. It felt nice — the first time I'd enjoyed the 
constant moisture falling out of the sky — as it washed my face clean of the sticky perspiration. 

"Thanks," I said as he followed me out. "It's almost worth getting sick to miss Gym." 

"Anytime." He was staring straight forward, squinting into the rain. 

"So are you going? This Saturday, I mean?" I was hoping he would, though it seemed unlikely. I couldn't 
picture him loading up to carpool with the rest of the kids from school; he didn't belong in the same 
world. But just hoping that he might gave me the first twinge of enthusiasm I'd felt for the outing. 

"Where are you all going, exactly?" He was still looking ahead, expressionless. 

"Down to La Push, to First Beach." I studied his face, trying to read it. His eyes seemed to narrow 
infirdtesimally. 

He glanced down at me from the comer of his eye, smiling wryly. "I really don't think I was invited." 
I sighed. "I just invited you." 

"Let's you and I not push poor Mike any further this week. We don't want him to snap." His eyes 
danced; he was enjoying the idea more than he should. 

"Mike-schmike." I muttered, preoccupied by the way he'd said "you and I." I liked it more than / should. 

We were near the parking lot now. I veered left, toward my truck. Something caught my jacket, yanking 
me back. 

"Where do you think you're going?" he asked, outraged. He was gripping a fistful of my jacket in one 
hand. 



I was confused. "I'm going home." 

"Didn't you hear me promise to take you safely home? Do you think I'm going to let you drive in your 
condition?" His voice was still indignant. 

"What condition? And what about my truck?" I complained. 

"I'll have Alice drop it off after school." He was towing me toward his car now, pulling me by my jacket. 
It was all I could do to keep from falling backward. He'd probably just drag me along anyway if I did. 

"Let go!" I insisted. He ignored me. I staggered along sideways across the wet sidewalk until we reached 
the Volvo. Then he finally freed me — I stumbled against the passenger door. 

"You are so pushy !" I grumbled. 

"It's open," was all he responded. He got in the driver's side. 

"I am perfectiy capable of driving myself home ! " I stood by the car, fuming. It was raining harder now, 
and I'd never put my hood up, so my hair was dripping down my back. 

He lowered the automatic window and leaned toward me across the seat. "Get in, Bella." 

I didn't answer. I was mentally calculating my chances of reaching the truck before he could catch me. I 
had to admit, they weren't good. 

"I'll just drag you back," he threatened, guessing my plan. 

I tried to maintain what dignity I could as I got into his car. I wasn't very successful — I looked like a 
half-drowned cat and my boots squeaked. 

"This is completely unnecessary," I said stiffly. 

He didn't answer. He fiddled with the controls, turning the heater up and the music down. As he pulled 
out of the parking lot, I was preparing to give him the silent treatment — my face in full pout mode — but 
then I recognized the music playing, and my curiosity got the better of my intentions. 

"Clair de Lune?" I asked, surprised. 

"You know Debussy?" He sounded surprised, too. 

"Not well," I admitted. "My mother plays a lot of classical music around the house — I only know my 
favorites." 

"It's one of my favorites, too." He stared out through the rain, lost in thought. 

I listened to the music, relaxing against the light gray leather seat. It was impossible not to respond to the 
familiar, soothing melody. The rain blurred everything outside the window into gray and green smudges. I 
began to realize we were driving very fast; the car moved so steadily, so evenly, though, I didn't feel the 
speed. Only the town flashing by gave it away. 

"What is your mother like?" he asked me suddenly. 

I glanced over to see him studying me with curious eyes. 

"She looks a lot like me, but she's prettier," I said. He raised his eyebrows. "I have too much Charlie in 



me. She's more outgoing than I am, and braver. She's irresponsible and slightly eccentric, and she's a 
very unpredictable cook. She's my best friend." I stopped. Talking about her was making me depressed. 

"How old are you, Bella?" His voice sounded frustrated for some reason I couldn't imagine. He'd 
stopped the car, and I realized we were at Charlie's house already. The rain was so heavy that I could 
barely see the house at all. It was like the car was submerged under a river. 

"I'm seventeen," I responded, a little confused. 

"You don't seem seventeen." 

His tone was reproachful; it made me laugh. 

"What?" he asked, curious again. 

"My mom always says I was bom thirty-five years old and that I get more middle-aged every year." I 
laughed, and then sighed. "Well, someone has to be the adult." I paused for a second. "You don't seem 
much like a junior in high school yourself," I noted. 

He made a face and changed the subject. 

"So why did your mother marry Phil?" 

I was surprised he would remember the name; I'd mentioned it just once, almost two months ago. It took 
me a moment to answer. 

"My mother. . . she's very young for her age. I think Phil makes her feel even younger. At any rate, she's 
crazy about him." I shook my head. The attraction was a mystery to me. 

"Do you approve?" he asked. 

"Does it matter?" I countered. "I want her to be happy. . . and he is who she wants." 

"That's very generous. . . I wonder," he mused. 

"What?" 

"Would she extend the same courtesy to you, do you think? No matter who your choice was?" He was 
suddenly intent, his eyes searching mine. 

"I-I think so," I stuttered. "But she's the parent, after all. It's a little bit different." 
"No one too scary then," he teased. 

I grinned in response. "What do you mean by scary? Multiple facial piercings and extensive tattoos?" 
"That's one definition, I suppose." 
"What's your definition?" 

But he ignored my question and asked me another. "Do you think that / could be scary?" He raised one 
eyebrow, and the faint trace of a smile lightened his face. 

I thought for a moment, wondering whether the truth or a he would go over better. I decided to go with 
the truth. "Hmmm. . . I think you could be, if you wanted to." 



"Are you frightened of me now?" The smile vanished, and his heavenly face was suddenly serious. 
"No." But I answered too quickly. The smile returned. 

"So, now are you going to tell me about your family?" I asked to distract him. "It's got to be a much more 
interesting story than mine." 

He was instantly cautious. "What do you want to know?" 

"The Cullens adopted you?" I verified. 

"Yes." 

I hesitated for a moment. "What happened to your parents?" 
"They died many years ago." His tone was matter-of-fact. 
"I'm sorry," I mumbled. 

"I don't really remember them that clearly. Carlisle and Esme have been my parents for a long time now." 
"And you love them." It wasn't a question. It was obvious in the way he spoke of them. 
"Yes." He smiled. "I couldn't imagine two better people." 
"You're very lucky." 
"I know I am." 

"And your brother and sister?" 

He glanced at the clock on the dashboard. 

"My brother and sister, and Jasper and Rosalie for that matter, are going to be quite upset if they have to 
stand in the rain waiting for me." 

"Oh, sorry, I guess you have to go." I didn't want to get out of the car. 

"And you probably want your truck back before Chief Swan gets home, so you don't have to tell him 
about the Biology incident." He grinned at me. 

"I'm sure he's already heard. There are no secrets in Forks." I sighed. 

He laughed, and there was an edge to his laughter. 

"Have fun at the beach. . . good weather for sunbathing." He glanced out at the sheeting rain. 

"Won't I see you tomorrow?" 

"No. Emmett and I are starting the weekend early." 

"What are you going to do?" A friend could ask that, right? I hoped the disappointment wasn't too 
apparent in my voice. 

"We're going to be hiking in the Goat Rocks Wilderness, just south of Rainier." 
I remembered Charlie had said the Cullens went camping frequentiy. 



"Oh, well, have fun." I tried to sound enthusiastic. I don't think I fooled him, though. A smile was playing 
around the edges of his hps. 

"Will you do something for me this weekend?" He turned to look me straight in the face, utilizing the full 
power of his burning gold eyes. 

I nodded helplessly. 

"Don't be offended, but you seem to be one of those people who just attract accidents like a magnet. 
So. . . try not to fall into the ocean or get run over or anything, all right?" He smiled crookedly. 

The helplessness had faded as he spoke. I glared at him. 

"I'll see what I can do," I snapped as I jumped out into the rain. I slammed the door behind me with 
excessive force. 

He was still smiling as he drove away. 
6. SCARY STORIES 

As I sat in my room, trying to concentrate on the third act of Macbeth, I was really Ustening for my truck. 
I would have thought, even over the pounding rain, I could have heard the engine's roar. But when I went 
to peek out the curtain — again — it was suddenly there. 

I wasn't looking forward to Friday, and it more than lived up to my non-expectations. Of course there 
were the fainting comments. Jessica especially seemed to get a kick out of that story. Luckily Mike had 
kept his mouth shut, and no one seemed to know about Edward's involvement. She did have a lot of 
questions about lunch, though. 

"So what did Edward Cullen want yesterday?" Jessica asked in Trig. 
"I don't know," I answered truthfully. "He never really got to the point." 
"You looked kind of mad," she fished. 
"Did I?" I kept my expression blank. 

"You know, I've never seen him sit with anyone but his family before. That was weird." 

"Weird," I agreed. She seemed annoyed; she flipped her dark curls impatiently — I guessed she'd been 
hoping to hear something that would make a good story for her to pass on. 

The worst part about Friday was that, even though I knew he wasn't going to be there, I still hoped. 
When I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica and Mike, I couldn't keep from looking at his table, where 
Rosalie, Alice, and Jasper sat talking, heads close together. And I couldn't stop the gloom that engulfed 
me as I realized I didn't know how long I would have to wait before I saw him again. 

At my usual table, everyone was full of our plans for the next day. Mike was animated again, putting a 
great deal of trust in the local weatherman who promised sun tomorrow. I'd have to see that before I 
believed it. But it was warmer today — almost sixty. Maybe the outing wouldn't be completely 
miserable. 



I intercepted a few unfriendly glances from Lauren during lunch, which I didn't understand until we were 
all walking out of the room together. I was right behind her, just a foot from her slick, silver blond hair, 
and she was evidently unaware of that. 

" . . .don't know why Bella " — she sneered my name — "doesn't just sit with the Cullens from now on." 

I heard her muttering to Mike. I'd never noticed what an unpleasant, nasal voice she had, and I was 
surprised by the malice in it. I really didn't know her well at all, certainly not well enough for her to dislike 
me — or so I'd thought. "She's my friend; she sits with us," Mike whispered back loyally, but also a bit 
territorially. I paused to let Jess and Angela pass me. I didn't want to hear any more. 



That night at dinner, Charlie seemed enthusiastic about my trip to La Push in the morning. I think he felt 
guilty for leaving me home alone on the weekends, but he'd spent too many years building his habits to 
break them now. Of course he knew the names of all the kids going, and their parents, and their 
great-grandparents, too, probably. He seemed to approve. I wondered if he would approve of my plan 
to ride to Seattle with Edward Cullen. Not that I was going to tell him. 

"Dad, do you know a place called Goat Rocks or something like that? I think it's south of Mount 
Rainier," I asked casually. 

"Yeah — why?" 

I shrugged. "Some kids were talking about camping there." 

"It's not a very good place for camping." He sounded surprised. "Too many bears. Most people go there 
during the hunting season." 

"Oh," I murmured. "Maybe I got the name wrong." 

I meant to sleep in, but an unusual brightness woke me. I opened my eyes to see a clear yellow light 
streaming through my window. I couldn't believe it. I hurried to the window to check, and sure enough, 
there was the sun. It was in the wrong place in the sky, too low, and it didn't seem to be as close as it 
should be, but it was definitely the sun. Clouds ringed the horizon, but a large patch of blue was visible in 
the middle. I lingered by the window as long as I could, afraid that if I left the blue would disappear 
again. 

The Newtons' Olympic Outfitters store was just north of town. I'd seen the store, but I'd never stopped 
there — not having much need for any supplies required for being outdoors over an extended period of 
time. In the parking lot I recognized Mike's Suburban and Tyler's Sentra. As I pulled up next to their 
vehicles, I could see the group standing around in front of the Suburban. Eric was there, along with two 
other boys I had class with; I was fairly sure their names were Ben and Conner. Jess was there, flanked 
by Angela and Lauren. Three other girls stood with them, including one I remembered falling over in Gym 
on Friday. That one gave me a dirty look as I got out of the truck, and whispered something to Lauren. 
Lauren shook out her cornsilk hair and eyed me scornfully. 

So it was going to be one of those days. 

At least Mike was happy to see me. 

"You came!" he called, delighted. "And I said it would be sunny today, didn't I?" 



"I told you I was coming," I reminded him. 



"We're just waiting for Lee and Samantha. . . unless you invited someone," Mike added. 

"Nope," I lied lightly, hoping I wouldn't get caught in the he. But also wishing that a miracle would occur, 
and Edward would appear. 

Mike looked satisfied. 

"Will you ride in my car? It's that or Lee's mom's minivan." 
"Sure." 

He smiled blissfully. It was so easy to make Mike happy. 

"You can have shotgun," he promised. I hid my chagrin. It wasn't as simple to make Mike and Jessica 
happy at the same time. I could see Jessica glowering at us now. 

The numbers worked out in my favor, though. Lee brought two extra people, and suddenly every seat 
was necessary. I managed to wedge Jess in between Mike and me in the front seat of the Suburban. 
Mike could have been more graceful about it, but at least Jess seemed appeased. 

It was only fifteen miles to La Push from Forks, with gorgeous, dense green forests edging the road most 
of the way and the wide Quillayute River snaking beneath it twice. I was glad I had the window seat. 
We'd rolled the windows down — the Suburban was a bit claustrophobic with nine people in it — and I 
tried to absorb as much sunlight as possible. 

I'd been to the beaches around La Push many times during my Forks summers with Charlie, so the 
mile-long crescent of First Beach was familiar to me. It was still breathtaking. The water was dark gray, 
even in the sunlight, white-capped and heaving to the gray, rocky shore. Islands rose out of the steel 
harbor waters with sheer cliff sides, reaching to uneven summits, and crowned with austere, soaring firs. 
The beach had only a thin border of actual sand at the water's edge, after which it grew into millions of 
large, smooth stones that looked uniformly gray from a distance, but close up were every shade a stone 
could be: terra-cotta, sea green, lavender, blue gray, dull gold. The tide line was strewn with huge 
driftwood trees, bleached bone white in the salt waves, some piled together against the edge of the forest 
fringe, some lying solitary, just out of reach of the waves. 

There was a brisk wind coming off the waves, cool and briny. Pelicans floated on the swells while 
seagulls and a lone eagle wheeled above them. The clouds still circled the sky, threatening to invade at 
any moment, but for now the sun shone bravely in its halo of blue sky. 

We picked our way down to the beach, Mike leading the way to a ring of driftwood logs that had 
obviously been used for parties like ours before. There was a fire circle already in place, filled with black 
ashes. Eric and the boy I thought was named Ben gathered broken branches of driftwood from the drier 
piles against the forest edge, and soon had a teepee- shaped construction built atop the old cinders. 

"Have you ever seen a driftwood fire?" Mike asked me. I was sitting on one of the bone-colored 
benches; the other girls clustered, gossiping excitedly, on either side of me. Mike kneeled by the fire, 
lighting one of the smaller sticks with a cigarette lighter. 

"No," I said as he placed the blazing twig carefully against the teepee. 

"You'll like this then — watch the colors." He lit another small branch and laid it alongside the first. The 
flames started to lick quickly up the dry wood. 

"It's blue," I said in surprise. 



"The salt does it. Pretty, isn't it?" He lit one more piece, placed it where the fire hadn't yet caught, and 
then came to sit by me. Thankfully, Jess was on his other side. She turned to him and claimed his 
attention. I watched the strange blue and green flames crackle toward the sky. 

After a half hour of chatter, some of the boys wanted to hike to the nearby tidal pools. It was a dilemma. 
On the one hand, I loved the tide pools. They had fascinated me since I was a child; they were one of the 
only things I ever looked forward to when I had to come to Forks. On the other hand, I'd also fallen into 
them a lot. Not a big deal when you're seven and with your dad. It reminded me of Edward's request — 
that I not fall into the ocean. 

Lauren was the one who made my decision for me. She didn't want to hike, and she was definitely 
wearing the wrong shoes for it. Most of the other girls besides Angela and Jessica decided to stay on the 
beach as well. I waited until Tyler and Eric had committed to remaining with them before I got up quietly 
to join the pro-hiking group. Mike gave me a huge smile when he saw that I was coming. 

The hike wasn't too long, though I hated to lose the sky in the woods. The green light of the forest was 
strangely at odds with the adolescent laughter, too murky and ominous to be in harmony with the light 
banter around me. I had to watch each step I took very carefully, avoiding roots below and branches 
above, and I soon fell behind. Eventually I broke through the emerald confines of the forest and found the 
rocky shore again. It was low tide, and a tidal river flowed past us on its way to the sea. Along its 
pebbled banks, shallow pools that never completely drained were teeming with life. 

I was very cautious not to lean too far over the little ocean ponds. The others were fearless, leaping over 
the rocks, perching precariously on the edges. I found a very stable-looking rock on the fringe of one of 
the largest pools and sat there cautiously, spellbound by the natural aquarium below me. The bouquets of 
brilliant anemones undulated ceaselessly in the invisible current, twisted shells scurried about the edges, 
obscuring the crabs within them, starfish stuck motionless to the rocks and each other, while one small 
black eel with white racing stripes wove through the bright green weeds, waiting for the sea to return. I 
was completely absorbed, except for one small part of my mind that wondered what Edward was doing 
now, and trying to imagine what he would be saying if he were here with me. 

Finally the boys were hungry, and I got up stiffly to follow them back. I tried to keep up better this time 
through the woods, so naturally I fell a few times. I got some shallow scrapes on my palms, and the 
knees of my jeans were stained green, but it could have been worse. 

When we got back to First Beach, the group we'd left behind had multiplied. As we got closer we could 
see the shining, straight black hair and copper skin of the newcomers, teenagers from the reservation 
come to socialize. 

The food was already being passed around, and the boys hurried to claim a share while Eric introduced 
us as we each entered the driftwood circle. Angela and I were the last to arrive, and, as Eric said our 
names, I noticed a younger boy sitting on the stones near the fire glance up at me in interest. I sat down 
next to Angela, and Mike brought us sandwiches and an array of sodas to choose from, while a boy who 
looked to be the oldest of the visitors rattled off the names of the seven others with him. All I caught was 
that one of the girls was also named Jessica, and the boy who noticed me was named Jacob. 

It was relaxing to sit with Angela; she was a restful kind of person to be around — she didn't feel the 
need to fill every silence with chatter. She left me free to think undisturbed while we ate. And I was 
thinking about how disjointedly time seemed to flow in Forks, passing in a blur at times, with single 
images standing out more clearly than others. And then, at other times, every second was significant, 
etched in my mind. I knew exactiy what caused the difference, and it disturbed me. 



During lunch the clouds started to advance, shnking across the blue sky, darting in front of the sun 
momentarily, casting long shadows across the beach, and blackening the waves. As they finished eating, 
people started to drift away in twos and threes. Some walked down to the edge of the waves, trying to 
skip rocks across the choppy surface. Others were gathering a second expedition to the tide pools. Mike 
— with Jessica shadowing him — headed up to the one shop in the village. Some of the local kids went 
with them; others went along on the hike. By the time they all had scattered, I was sitting alone on my 
driftwood log, with Lauren and Tyler occupying themselves by the CD player someone had thought to 
bring, and three teenagers from the reservation perched around the circle, including the boy named Jacob 
and the oldest boy who had acted as spokesperson. 

A few minutes after Angela left with the hikers, Jacob sauntered over to take her place by my side. He 
looked fourteen, maybe fifteen, and had long, glossy black hair pulled back with a rubber band at the 
nape of his neck. His skin was beautiful, silky and russet-colored; his eyes were dark, set deep above the 
high planes of his cheekbones. He still had just a hint of childish roundness left around his chin. 
Altogether, a very pretty face. However, my positive opinion of his looks was damaged by the first 
words out of his mouth. 

"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you?" 

It was like the first day of school all over again. 

"Bella," I sighed. 

"I'm Jacob Black." He held his hand out in a friendly gesture. "You bought my dad's truck." 

"Oh," I said, relieved, shaking his sleek hand. "You're Billy's son. I probably should remember you." 

"No, I'm the youngest of the family — you would remember my older sisters." 

"Rachel and Rebecca," I suddenly recalled. Charlie and Billy had thrown us together a lot during my 
visits, to keep us busy while they fished. We were all too shy to make much progress as friends. Of 
course, I'd kicked up enough tantrums to end the fishing trips by the time I was eleven. 

"Are they here?" I examined the girls at the ocean's edge, wondering if I would recognize them now. 

"No." Jacob shook his head. "Rachel got a scholarship to Washington State, and Rebecca married a 
Samoan surfer — she lives in Hawaii now." 

"Married. Wow." I was stunned. The twins were only a little over a year older than I was. 
"So how do you like the truck?" he asked. 
"I love it. It runs great." 

"Yeah, but it's really slow," he laughed. "I was so relived when Charlie bought it. My dad wouldn't let me 
work on building another car when we had a perfectly good vehicle right there." 

"It's not that slow," I objected. 

"Have you tried to go over sixty?" 

"No," I admitted. 



"Good. Don't." He grinned. 



I couldn't help grinning back. "It does great in a collision," I offered in my truck's defense. 
"I don't think a tank could take out that old monster," he agreed with another laugh. 
"So you build cars?" I asked, impressed. 

"When I have free time, and parts. You wouldn't happen to know where I could get my hands on a 
master cylinder for a 1986 Volkswagen Rabbit?" he added jokingly. He had a pleasant, husky voice. 

"Sorry," I laughed, "I haven't seen any lately, but I'll keep my eyes open for you." As if I knew what that 
was. He was very easy to talk with. 

He flashed a brilliant smile, looking at me appreciatively in a way I was learning to recognize. I wasn't the 
only one who noticed. 

"You know Bella, Jacob?" Lauren asked — in what I imagined was an insolent tone — from across the 
fire. 

"We've sort of known each other since I was bom," he laughed, smiling at me again. 

"How nice." She didn't sound like she thought it was nice at all, and her pale, fishy eyes narrowed. 

"Bella," she called again, watching my face carefully, "I was just saying to Tyler that it was too bad none 
of the Cullens could come out today. Didn't anyone think to invite them?" Her expression of concern was 
unconvincing. 

"You mean Dr. Carlisle Cullen's family?" the tall, older boy asked before I could respond, much to 
Lauren's irritation. He was really closer to a man than a boy, and his voice was very deep. 

"Yes, do you know them?" she asked condescendingly, turning halfway toward him. 

"The Cullens don't come here," he said in a tone that closed the subject, ignoring her question. 

Tyler, trying to win back her attention, asked Lauren's opinion on a CD he held. She was distracted. 

I stared at the deep- voiced boy, taken aback, but he was looking away toward the dark forest behind 
us. He'd said that the Cullens didn't come here, but his tone had implied something more — that they 
weren't allowed; they were prohibited. His manner left a strange impression on me, and I tried to ignore it 
without success. 

Jacob interrupted my meditation. "So is Forks driving you insane yet?" 

"Oh, I'd say that's an understatement." I grimaced. He grinned understanding^. 

I was still turning over the brief comment on the Cullens, and I had a sudden inspiration. It was a stupid 
plan, but I didn't have any better ideas. I hoped that young Jacob was as yet inexperienced around girls, 
so that he wouldn't see through my sure-to-be-pitiful attempts at flirting. 

"Do you want to walk down the beach with me?" I asked, trying to imitate that way Edward had of 
looking up from underneath his eyelashes. It couldn't have nearly the same effect, I was sure, but Jacob 
jumped up willingly enough. 

As we walked north across the multihued stones toward the driftwood seawall, the clouds finally closed 
ranks across the sky, causing the sea to darken and the temperature to drop. I shoved my hands deep 
into the pockets of my jacket. 



"So you're, what, sixteen?" I asked, trying not to look like an idiot as I fluttered my eyelids the way I'd 
seen girls do on TV. 

"I just turned fifteen," he confessed, flattered. 

"Really?" My face was full of false surprise. "I would have thought you were older." 
"I'm tall for my age," he explained. 

"Do you come up to Forks much?" I asked archly, as if I was hoping for a yes. I sounded idiotic to 
myself. I was afraid he would turn on me with disgust and accuse me of my fraud, but he still seemed 
flattered. 

"Not too much," he admitted with a frown. "But when I get my car finished I can go up as much as I want 
— after I get my license," he amended. 

"Who was that other boy Lauren was talking to? He seemed a little old to be hanging out with us." I 
purposefully lumped myself in with the youngsters, trying to make it clear that I preferred Jacob. 

"That's Sam — he's nineteen," he informed me. 

"What was that he was saying about the doctor's family?" I asked innocently. 

"The Cullens? Oh, they're not supposed to come onto the reservation." He looked away, out toward 
James Island, as he confirmed what I'd thought I'd heard in Sam's voice. 

"Why not?" 

He glanced back at me, biting his lip. "Oops. I'm not supposed to say anything about that." 

"Oh, I won't tell anyone, I'm just curious." I tried to make my smile alluring, wondering if I was laying it 
on too thick. 

He smiled back, though, looking allured. Then he lifted one eyebrow and his voice was even huskier than 
before. 

"Do you like scary stories?" he asked ominously. 

"I love them," I enthused, making an effort to smolder at him. 

Jacob strolled to a nearby driftwood tree that had its roots sticking out like the attenuated legs of a huge, 
pale spider. He perched lightly on one of the twisted roots while I sat beneath him on the body of the 
tree. He stared down at the rocks, a smile hovering around the edges of his broad lips. I could see he 
was going to try to make this good. I focused on keeping the vital interest I felt out of my eyes. 

"Do you know any of our old stories, about where we came from — the Quileutes, I mean?" he began. 

"Not really," I admitted. 

"Well, there are lots of legends, some of them claiming to date back to the Flood — supposedly, the 
ancient Quileutes tied their canoes to the tops of the tallest trees on the mountain to survive like Noah and 
the ark." He smiled, to show me how little stock he put in the histories. "Another legend claims that we 
descended from wolves — and that the wolves are our brothers still. It's against tribal law to kill them. 

"Then there are the stories about the cold ones." His voice dropped a little lower. 



"The cold ones?" I asked, not faking my intrigue now. 

"Yes. There are stories of the cold ones as old as the wolf legends, and some much more recent. 
According to legend, my own great-grandfather knew some of them. He was the one who made the 
treaty that kept them off our land." He rolled his eyes. 

"Your great-grandfather?" I encouraged. 

"He was a tribal elder, like my father. You see, the cold ones are the natural enemies of the wolf — well, 
not the wolf, really, but the wolves that turn into men, like our ancestors. You would call them 
werewolves." 

"Werewolves have enemies?" 
"Only one." 

I stared at him earnestiy, hoping to disguise my impatience as admiration. 

"So you see," Jacob continued, "the cold ones are traditionally our enemies. But this pack that came to 
our territory during my great-grandfather's time was different. They didn't hunt the way others of their 
kind did — they weren't supposed to be dangerous to the tribe. So my great-grandfather made a truce 
with them. If they would promise to stay off our lands, we wouldn't expose them to the pale-faces." He 
winked at me. 

"If they weren't dangerous, then why. . . ?" I tried to understand, struggling not to let him see how 
seriously I was considering his ghost story. 

"There's always a risk for humans to be around the cold ones, even if they're civilized like this clan was. 
You never know when they might get too hungry to resist." He deliberately worked a thick edge of 
menace into his tone. 

"What do you mean, 'civilized'?" 

"They claimed that they didn't hunt humans. They supposedly were somehow able to prey on animals 
instead." 

I tried to keep my voice casual. "So how does it fit in with the Cullens? Are they like the cold ones your 
greatgrandfather met?" 

"No." He paused dramatically. "They are the same ones." 

He must have thought the expression on my face was fear inspired by his story. He smiled, pleased, and 
continued. 

"There are more of them now, a new female and a new male, but the rest are the same. In my 
great-grandfather's time they already knew of the leader, Carlisle. He'd been here and gone before your 
people had even arrived." He was fighting a smile. 

"And what are they?" I finally asked. "What are the cold ones?" 

He smiled darkly. 

"Blood drinkers," he replied in a chilling voice. "Your people call them vampires." 
I stared out at the rough surf after he answered, not sure what my face was exposing. 



"You have goose bumps," he laughed dehghtedly. 

"You're a good storyteller," I complimented him, still staring into the waves. 

"Pretty crazy stuff, though, isn't it? No wonder my dad doesn't want us to talk about it to anyone." 

I couldn't control my expression enough to look at him yet. "Don't worry, I won't give you away." 

"I guess I just violated the treaty," he laughed. 

"I'll take it to the grave," I promised, and then I shivered. 

"Seriously, though, don't say anything to Charlie. He was pretty mad at my dad when he heard that some 
of us weren't going to the hospital since Dr. Cullen started working there." 

"I won't, of course not." 

"So do you think we're a bunch of superstitious natives or what?" he asked in a playful tone, but with a 
hint of worry. I still hadn't looked away from the ocean. 

I turned and smiled at him as normally as I could. 

"No. I think you're very good at telling scary stories, though. I still have goose bumps, see?" I held up my 
arm. 

"Cool." He smiled. 

And then the sound of the beach rocks clattering against each other warned us that someone was 
approaching. Our heads snapped up at the same time to see Mike and Jessica about fifty yards away, 
walking toward us. 

"There you are, Bella," Mike called in relief, waving his arm over his head. 

"Is that your boyfriend?" Jacob asked, alerted by the jealous edge in Mike's voice. I was surprised it was 
so obvious. 

"No, definitely not," I whispered. I was tremendously grateful to Jacob, and eager to make him as happy 
as possible. I winked at him, carefully turning away from Mike to do so. He smiled, elated by my inept 
flirting. 

"So when I get my license. . . " he began. 

"You should come see me in Forks. We could hang out sometime." I felt guilty as I said this, knowing 
that I'd used him. But I really did like Jacob. He was someone I could easily be friends with. 

Mike had reached us now, with Jessica still a few paces back. I could see his eyes appraising Jacob, and 
looking satisfied at his obvious youth. 

"Where have you been?" he asked, though the answer was right in front of him. 
"Jacob was just telling me some local stories," I volunteered. "It was really interesting." 
I smiled at Jacob warmly, and he grinned back. 

"Well," Mike paused, carefully reassessing the situation as he watched our camaraderie. "We're packing 
up — it looks like it's going to rain soon." 



We all looked up at the glowering sky. It certainly did look like rain. 
"Okay." I jumped up. "I'm coming." 

"It was nice to see you again ," Jacob said, and I could tell he was taunting Mike just a bit. 
"It really was. Next time Charlie comes down to see Billy, I'll come, too," I promised. 
His grin stretched across his face. "That would be cool." 
"And thanks," I added earnestly. 

I pulled up my hood as we tramped across the rocks toward the parking lot. A few drops were 
beginning to fall, making black spots on the stones where they landed. When we got to the Suburban the 
others were already loading everything back in. I crawled into the backseat by Angela and Tyler, 
announcing that I'd already had my turn in the shotgun position. Angela just stared out the window at the 
escalating storm, and Lauren twisted around in the middle seat to occupy Tyler's attention, so I could 
simply lay my head back on the seat and close my eyes and try very hard not to think. 



7. NIGHTMARE 



I told Charlie I had a lot of homework to do, and that I didn't want anything to eat. There was a 
basketball game on that he was excited about, though of course / had no idea what was special about it, 
so he wasn't aware of anything unusual in my face or tone. 

Once in my room, I locked the door. I dug through my desk until I found my old headphones, and I 
plugged them into my little CD player. I picked up a CD that Phil had given to me for Christmas. It was 
one of his favorite bands, but they used a little too much bass and shrieking for my tastes. I popped it into 
place and lay down on my bed. I put on the headphones, hit Play, and turned up the volume until it hurt 
my ears. I closed my eyes, but the light still intruded, so I added a pillow over the top half of my face. 

I concentrated very carefully on the music, trying to understand the lyrics, to unravel the complicated 
drum patterns. By the third time I'd listened through the CD, I knew all the words to the choruses, at 
least. I was surprised to find that I really did like the band after all, once I got past the blaring noise. I'd 
have to thank Phil again. 

And it worked. The shattering beats made it impossible for me to think — which was the whole purpose 
of the exercise. I listened to the CD again and again, until I was singing along with all the songs, until, 
finally, I fell asleep. 

I opened my eyes to a familiar place. Aware in some corner of my consciousness that I was dreaming, I 
recognized the green light of the forest. I could hear the waves crashing against the rocks somewhere 
nearby. And I knew that if I found the ocean, I'd be able to see the sun. I was trying to follow the sound, 
but then Jacob Black was there, tugging on my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of the 
forest. 

"Jacob? What's wrong?" I asked. His face was frightened as he yanked with all his strength against my 
resistance; I didn't want to go into the dark. 

"Run, Bella, you have to run!" he whispered, terrified. 



"This way, Bella!" I recognized Mike's voice calling out of the gloomy heart of the trees, but I couldn't 
see him. 

"Why?" I asked, still pulling against Jacob's grasp, desperate now to find the sun. 

But Jacob let go of my hand and yelped, suddenly shaking, falling to the dim forest floor. He twitched on 
the ground as I watched in horror. 

"Jacob!" I screamed. But he was gone. In his place was a large red-brown wolf with black eyes. The 
wolf faced away from me, pointing toward the shore, the hair on the back of his shoulders bristling, low 
growls issuing from between his exposed fangs. 

"Bella, run!" Mike cried out again from behind me. But I didn't turn. I was watching a light coming toward 
me from the beach. 

And then Edward stepped out from the trees, his skin faintly glowing, his eyes black and dangerous. He 
held up one hand and beckoned me to come to him. The wolf growled at my feet. 

I took a step forward, toward Edward. He smiled then, and his teeth were sharp, pointed. 

"Trust me," he purred. 

I took another step. 

The wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire, fangs aiming for the jugular. 
"No!" I screamed, wrenching upright out of my bed. 

My sudden movement caused the headphones to pull the CD player off the bedside table, and it clattered 
to the wooden floor. 

My light was still on, and I was sitting fully dressed on the bed, with my shoes on. I glanced, disoriented, 
at the clock on my dresser. It was five-thirty in the morning. 

I groaned, fell back, and rolled over onto my face, kicking off my boots. I was too uncomfortable to get 
anywhere near sleep, though. I rolled back over and unbuttoned my jeans, yanking them off awkwardly 
as I tried to stay horizontal. I could feel the braid in my hair, an uncomfortable ridge along the back of my 
skull. I turned onto my side and ripped the rubber band out, quickly combing through the plaits with my 
fingers. I pulled the pillow back over my eyes. 

It was all no use, of course. My subconscious had dredged up exactly the images I'd been trying so 
desperately to avoid. I was going to have to face them now. 

I sat up, and my head spun for a minute as the blood flowed downward. First things first, I thought to 
myself, happy to put it off as long as possible. I grabbed my bathroom bag. 

The shower didn't last nearly as long as I hoped it would, though. Even taking the time to blow-dry my 
hair, I was soon out of things to do in the bathroom. Wrapped in a towel, I crossed back to my room. I 
couldn't tell if Charlie was still asleep, or if he had already left. I went to look out my window, and the 
cruiser was gone. Fishing again. 

I dressed slowly in my most comfy sweats and then made my bed — something I never did. I couldn't 
put it off any longer. I went to my desk and switched on my old computer. 

I hated using the Internet here. My modem was sadly outdated, my free service substandard; just dialing 



up took so long that I decided to go get myself a bowl of cereal while I waited. 

I ate slowly, chewing each bite with care. When I was done, I washed the bowl and spoon, dried them, 
and put them away. My feet dragged as I climbed the stairs. I went to my CD player first, picking it up 
off the floor and placing it precisely in the center of the table. I pulled out the headphones, and put them 
away in the desk drawer. Then I turned the same CD on, turning it down to the point where it was 
background noise. 

With another sigh, I turned to my computer. Naturally, the screen was covered in pop- up ads. I sat in my 
hard folding chair and began closing all the little windows. Eventually I made it to my favorite search 
engine. I shot down a few more pop-ups and then typed in one word. 

Vampire. 

It took an infuriatingly long time, of course. When the results came up, there was a lot to sift through — 
everything from movies and TV shows to role-playing games, underground metal, and gothic cosmetic 
companies. 

Then I found a promising site — Vampires A — Z. I waited impatientiy for it to load, quickly clicking 
closed each ad that flashed across the screen. Finally the screen was finished — simple white 
background with black text, academic-looking. Two quotes greeted me on the home page: 



Throughout the vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no figure so terrible, no figure 
so dreaded and abhorred, yet dight with such fearful fascination, as the vampire, who is himself 
neither ghost nor demon, but yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the mysterious and 
terrible qualities of both. — Rev. Montague Summers 



If there is in this world a well-attested account, it is that of the vampires. Nothing is lacking: 
official reports, affidavits of well-known people, of surgeons, of priests, of magistrates; the 
judicial proof is most complete. And with all that, who is there who believes in vampiresl — 
Rousseau 



The rest of the site was an alphabetized listing of all the different myths of vampires held throughout the 
world. The first I clicked on, the Danag, was a Filipino vampire supposedly responsible for planting taro 
on the islands long ago. The myth continued that the Danag worked with humans for many years, but the 
partnership ended one day when a woman cut her finger and a Danag sucked her wound, enjoying the 
taste so much that it drained her body completely of blood. 

I read carefully through the descriptions, looking for anything that sounded familiar, let alone plausible. It 
seemed that most vampire myths centered around beautiful women as demons and children as victims; 
they also seemed like constructs created to explain away the high mortality rates for young children, and 
to give men an excuse for infidelity. Many of the stories involved bodiless spirits and warnings against 
improper burials. There wasn't much that sounded like the movies I'd seen, and only a very few, like the 
Hebrew Estrie and the Polish Upier, who were even preoccupied with drinking blood. 

Only three entries really caught my attention: the Romanian Varacolaci, a powerful undead being who 
could appear as a beautiful, pale- skinned human, the Slovak Nelapsi, a creature so strong and fast it 



could massacre an entire village in the single hour after midnight, and one other, the Stregoni benefici. 
About this last there was only one brief sentence. 

Stregoni benefici: An Italian vampire, said to be on the side of goodness, and a mortal enemy of 
all evil vampires. 

It was a relief, that one small entry, the one myth among hundreds that claimed the existence of good 
vampires. 

Overall, though, there was little that coincided with Jacob's stories or my own observations. I'd made a 
little catalogue in my mind as I'd read and carefully compared it with each myth. Speed, strength, beauty, 
pale skin, eyes that shift color; and then Jacob's criteria: blood drinkers, enemies of the werewolf, 
cold-skinned, and immortal. There were very few myths that matched even one factor. 

And then another problem, one that I'd remembered from the small number of scary movies that I'd seen 
and was backed up by today's reading — vampires couldn't come out in the daytime, the sun would burn 
them to a cinder. They slept in coffins all day and came out only at night. 

Aggravated, I snapped off the computer's main power switch, not waiting to shut things down properly. 
Through my irritation, I felt overwhelming embarrassment. It was all so stupid. I was sitting in my room, 
researching vampires. What was wrong with me? I decided that most of the blame belonged on the 
doorstep of the town of Forks — and the entire sodden Olympic Peninsula, for that matter. 

I had to get out of the house, but there was nowhere I wanted to go that didn't involve a three-day drive. 
I pulled on my boots anyway, unclear where I was headed, and went downstairs. I shrugged into my 
raincoat without checking the weather and stomped out the door. 

It was overcast, but not raining yet. I ignored my truck and started east on foot, angling across Charlie's 
yard toward the ever-encroaching forest. It didn't take long till I was deep enough for the house and the 
road to be invisible, for the only sound to be the squish of the damp earth under my feet and the sudden 
cries of the jays. 

There was a thin ribbon of a trail that led through the forest here, or I wouldn't risk wandering on my own 
like this. My sense of direction was hopeless; I could get lost in much less helpful surroundings. The trail 
wound deeper and deeper into the forest, mostly east as far as I could tell. It snaked around the Sitka 
spruces and the hemlocks, the yews and the maples. I only vaguely knew the names of the trees around 
me, and all I knew was due to Charlie pointing them out to me from the cruiser window in earlier days. 
There were many I didn't know, and others I couldn't be sure about because they were so covered in 
green parasites. 

I followed the trail as long as my anger at myself pushed me forward. As that started to ebb, I slowed. A 
few drops of moisture trickled down from the canopy above me, but I couldn't be certain if it was 
beginning to rain or if it was simply pools left over from yesterday, held high in the leaves above me, 
slowly dripping their way back to the earth. A recently fallen tree — I knew it was recent because it 
wasn't entirely carpeted in moss — rested against the trunk of one of her sisters, creating a sheltered little 
bench just a few safe feet off the trail. I stepped over the ferns and sat carefully, making sure my jacket 
was between the damp seat and my clothes wherever they touched, and leaned my hooded head back 
against the living tree. 

This was the wrong place to have come. I should have known, but where else was there to go? The 
forest was deep green and far too much like the scene in last night's dream to allow for peace of mind. 
Now that there was no longer the sound of my soggy footsteps, the silence was piercing. The birds were 



quiet, too, the drops increasing in frequency, so it must be raining above. The ferns stood higher than my 
head, now that I was seated, and I knew someone could walk by on the path, three feet away, and not 
see me. 

Here in the trees it was much easier to believe the absurdities that embarrassed me indoors. Nothing had 
changed in this forest for thousands of years, and all the myths and legends of a hundred different lands 
seemed much more likely in this green haze than they had in my clear-cut bedroom. 

I forced myself to focus on the two most vital questions I had to answer, but I did so unwillingly. 

First, I had to decide if it was possible that what Jacob had said about the Cullens could be true. 

Immediately my mind responded with a resounding negative. It was silly and morbid to entertain such 
ridiculous notions. But what, then? I asked myself. There was no rational explanation for how I was alive 
at this moment. I listed again in my head the things I'd observed myself: the impossible speed and 
strength, the eye color shifting from black to gold and back again, the inhuman beauty, the pale, frigid 
skin. And more — small things that registered slowly — how they never seemed to eat, the disturbing 
grace with which they moved. And the way be 

sometimes spoke, with unfamiUar cadences and phrases that better fit the style of a tum-of-the-century 
novel than that of a twenty-first-century classroom. He had skipped class the day we'd done blood 
typing. He hadn't said no to the beach trip till he heard where we were going. He seemed to know what 
everyone around him was thinking. . . except me. He had told me he was the villain, dangerous. . . 

Could the Cullens be vampires? 

Well, they were something. Something outside the possibility of rational justification was taking place in 
front of my incredulous eyes. Whether it be Jacob's cold ones or my own superhero theory, Edward 
Cullen was not. . . human. He was something more. 

So then — maybe. That would have to be my answer for now. 

And then the most important question of all. What was I going to do if it was true? 

7f Edward was a vampire — I could hardly make myself think the words — then what should I do? 
Involving someone else was definitely out. I couldn't even believe myself; anyone I told would have me 
committed. 

Only two options seemed practical. The first was to take his advice: to be smart, to avoid him as much as 
possible. To cancel our plans, to go back to ignoring him as far as I was able. To pretend there was an 
impenetrably thick glass wall between us in the one class where we were forced together. To tell him to 
leave me alone — and mean it this time. 

I was gripped in a sudden agony of despair as I considered that alternative. My mind rejected the pain, 
quickly skipping on to the next option. 

I could do nothing different. After all, if he was something. . . sinister, he'd done nothing to hurt me so far. 
In fact, I would be a dent in Tyler's fender if he hadn't acted so quickly. So quickly, I argued with myself, 
that it might have been sheer reflexes. But if it was a reflex to save lives, how bad could he be? I retorted. 
My head spun around in answerless circles. 

There was one thing I was sure of, if I was sure of anything. The dark Edward in my dream last night was 
a reflection only of my fear of the word Jacob had spoken, and not Edward himself. Even so, when I'd 
screamed out in terror at the werewolf s lunge, it wasn't fear for the wolf that brought the cry of "no" to 



my lips. It was fear that he would be harmed — even as he called to me with sharp-edged fangs, I feared 
for him. 

And I knew in that I had my answer. I didn't know if there ever was a choice, really. I was already in too 
deep. Now that I knew — if I knew — I could do nothing about my frightening secret. Because when I 
thought of him, of his voice, his hypnotic eyes, the magnetic force of his personality, I wanted nothing 
more than to be with him right now. Even if. . . but I couldn't think it. Not here, alone in the darkening 
forest. Not while the rain made it dim as twilight under the canopy and pattered like footsteps across the 
matted earthen floor. I shivered and rose quickly from my place of concealment, worried that somehow 
the path would have disappeared with the rain. 

But it was there, safe and clear, winding its way out of the dripping green maze. I followed it hastily, my 
hood pulled close around my face, becoming surprised, as I nearly ran through the trees, at how far I had 
come. I started to wonder if I was heading out at all, or following the path farther into the confines of the 
forest. Before I could get too panicky, though, I began to glimpse some open spaces through the webbed 
branches. And then I could hear a car passing on the street, and I was free, Charlie's lawn stretched out 
in front of me, the house beckoning me, promising warmth and dry socks. 

It was just noon when I got back inside. I went upstairs and got dressed for the day, jeans and a t-shirt, 
since I was staying indoors. It didn't take too much effort to concentrate on my task for the day, a paper 
on Macbeth that was due Wednesday. I settled into outlining a rough draft contentedly, more serene than 
I'd felt since. . . well, since Thursday afternoon, if I was being honest. 

That had always been my way, though. Making decisions was the painful part for me, the part I agonized 
over. But once the decision was made, I simply followed through — usually with relief that the choice 
was made. Sometimes the relief was tainted by despair, like my decision to come to Forks. But it was 
still better than wrestling with the alternatives. 

This decision was ridiculously easy to live with. Dangerously easy. 

And so the day was quiet, productive — I finished my paper before eight. Charlie came home with a 
large catch, and I made a mental note to pick up a book of recipes for fish while I was in Seattle next 
week. The chills that flashed up my spine whenever I thought of that trip were no different than the ones 
I'd felt before I'd taken my walk with Jacob Black. They should be different, I thought. I should be afraid 
— I knew I should be, but I couldn't feel the right kind of fear. 

I slept dreamlessly that night, exhausted from beginning my day so early, and sleeping so poorly the night 
before. I woke, for the second time since arriving in Forks, to the bright yellow light of a sunny day. I 
skipped to the window, stunned to see that there was hardly a cloud in the sky, and those there were just 
fleecy little white puffs that couldn't possibly be carrying any rain. I opened the window — surprised 
when it opened silentiy, without sticking, not having opened it in who knows how many years — and 
sucked in the relatively dry air. It was nearly warm and hardly windy at all. My blood was electric in my 
veins. 

Charlie was finishing breakfast when I came downstairs, and he picked up on my mood immediately. 
"Nice day out," he commented. 
"Yes," I agreed with a grin. 

He smiled back, his brown eyes crinkling around the edges. When Charlie smiled, it was easier to see 
why he and my mother had jumped too quickly into an early marriage. Most of the young romantic he'd 
been in those days had faded before I'd known him, as the curly brown hair — the same color, if not the 



same texture, as mine — had dwindled, slowly revealing more and more of the shiny skin of his forehead. 
But when he smiled I could see a little of the man who had run away with Renee when she was just two 
years older than I was now. 

I ate breakfast cheerily, watching the dust moats stirring in the sunlight that streamed in the back window. 
Charlie called out a goodbye, and I heard the cruiser pull away from the house. I hesitated on my way 
out the door, hand on my rain jacket. It would be tempting fate to leave it home. With a sigh, I folded it 
over my arm and stepped out into the brightest light I'd seen in months. 

By dint of much elbow grease, I was able to get both windows in the truck almost completely rolled 
down. I was one of the first ones to school; I hadn't even checked the clock in my hurry to get outside. I 
parked and headed toward the seldom-used picnic benches on the south side of the cafeteria. The 
benches were still a little damp, so I sat on my jacket, glad to have a use for it. My homework was done 
— the product of a slow social life — but there were a few Trig problems I wasn't sure I had right. I 
took out my book industriously, but halfway through rechecking the first problem I was daydreaming, 
watching the sunlight play on the red-barked trees. I sketched inattentively along the margins of my 
homework. After a few minutes, I suddenly realized I'd drawn five pairs of dark eyes staring out of the 
page at me. I scrubbed them out with the eraser. 

"Bella!" I heard someone call, and it sounded like Mike. 

I looked around to realize that the school had become populated while I'd been sitting there, 
absentminded. Everyone was in t-shirts, some even in shorts though the temperature couldn't be over 
sixty. Mike was coming toward me in khaki shorts and a striped Rugby shirt, waving. 

"Hey, Mike," I called, waving back, unable to be halfhearted on a morning like this. 

He came to sit by me, the tidy spikes of his hair shining golden in the light, his grin stretching across his 
face. He was so delighted to see me, I couldn't help but feel gratified. 

"I never noticed before — your hair has red in it," he commented, catching between his fingers a strand 
that was fluttering in the light breeze. 

"Only in the sun." 

I became just a little uncomfortable as he tucked the lock behind my ear. 

"Great day, isn't it?" 

"My kind of day," I agreed. 

"What did you do yesterday?" His tone was just a bit too proprietary. 

"I mostly worked on my essay." I didn't add that I was finished with it — no need to sound smug. 
He hit his forehead with the heel of his hand. "Oh yeah — that's due Thursday, right?" 
"Urn, Wednesday, I think." 

"Wednesday?" He frowned. "That's not good. . . What are you writing yours on?" 
"Whether Shakespeare's treatment of the female characters is misogynistic." 
He stared at me like I'd just spoken in pig Latin. 



"I guess I'll have to get to work on that tonight," he said, deflated. "I was going to ask if you wanted to go 
out" 

"Oh." I was taken off guard. Why couldn't I ever have a pleasant conversation with Mike anymore 
without it getting awkward? 

"Well, we could go to dinner or something. . . and I could work on it later." He smiled at me hopefully. 

"Mike. . . " I hated being put on the spot. "I don't think that would be the best idea." 

His face fell. "Why?" he asked, his eyes guarded. My thoughts flickered to Edward, wondering if that's 
where his thoughts were as well. 

"I think. . . and if you ever repeat what I'm saying right now I will cheerfully beat you to death," I 
threatened, "but I think that would hurt Jessica's feelings." 

He was bewildered, obviously not thinking in that direction at all. "Jessica?" 

"Really, Mike, are you blind?' 

"Oh," he exhaled — clearly dazed. I took advantage of that to make my escape. 

"It's time for class, and I can't be late again." I gathered my books up and stuffed them in my bag. 

We walked in silence to building three, and his expression was distracted. I hoped whatever thoughts he 
was immersed in were leading him in the right direction. 

When I saw Jessica in Trig, she was bubbling with enthusiasm. She, Angela, and Lauren were going to 
Port Angeles tonight to go dress shopping for the dance, and she wanted me to come, too, even though I 
didn't need one. I was indecisive. It would be nice to get out of town with some girlfriends, but Lauren 
would be there. And who knew what I could be doing tonight. . . But that was definitely the wrong path 
to let my mind wander down. Of course I was happy about the sunlight. But that wasn't completely 
responsible for the euphoric mood I was in, not even close. 

So I gave her a maybe, telling her I'd have to talk with Charlie first. 

She talked of nothing but the dance on the way to Spanish, continuing as if without an interruption when 
class finally ended, five minutes late, and we were on our way to lunch. I was far too lost in my own 
frenzy of anticipation to notice much of what she said. I was painfully eager to see not just him but all the 
Cullens — to compare them with the new suspicions that plagued my mind. As I crossed the threshold of 
the cafeteria, I felt the first true tingle of fear slither down my spine and settle in my stomach. Would they 
be able to know what I was thinking? And then a different feeling jolted through me — would Edward be 
waiting to sit with me again? 

As was my routine, I glanced first toward the Cullens' table. A shiver of panic trembled in my stomach as 
I realized it was empty. With dwindling hope, my eyes scoured the rest of the cafeteria, hoping to find 
him alone, waiting for me. The place was nearly filled — Spanish had made us late — but there was no 
sign of Edward or any of his family. Desolation hit me with crippling strength. 

I shambled along behind Jessica, not bothering to pretend to listen anymore. 

We were late enough that everyone was already at our table. I avoided the empty chair next to Mike in 
favor of one by Angela. I vaguely noticed that Mike held the chair out politely for Jessica, and that her 
face lit up in response. 



Angela asked a few quiet questions about the Macbeth paper, which I answered as naturally as I could 
while spiraling downward in misery. She, too, invited me to go with them tonight, and I agreed now, 
grasping at anything to distract myself. 

I realized I'd been holding on to a last shred of hope when I entered Biology, saw his empty seat, and felt 
a new wave of disappointment. 

The rest of the day passed slowly, dismally. In Gym, we had a lecture on the rules of badminton, the next 
torture they had lined up for me. But at least it meant I got to sit and listen instead of stumbling around on 
the court. The best part was the coach didn't finish, so I got another day off tomorrow. Never mind that 
the day after they would arm me with a racket before unleashing me on the rest of the class. 

I was glad to leave campus, so I would be free to pout and mope before I went out tonight with Jessica 
and company. But right after I walked in the door of Charlie's house, Jessica called to cancel our plans. I 
tried to be happy that Mike had asked her out to dinner — I really was relieved that he finally seemed to 
be catching on — but my enthusiasm sounded false in my own ears. She rescheduled our shopping trip 
for tomorrow night. 

Which left me with little in the way of distractions. I had fish marinating for dinner, with a salad and bread 
left over from the night before, so there was nothing to do there. I spent a focused half hour on 
homework, but then I was through with that, too. I checked my e-mail, reading the backlog of letters 
from my mother, getting snippier as they progressed to the present. I sighed and typed a quick response. 



Mom, 

Sorry. I've been out. I went to the beach with some friends. And I had to write a paper. 



My excuses were fairly pathetic, so I gave up on that. 

It's sunny outside today - 1 know, I'm shocked, too - so I'm going to go outside and soak up 
as much vitamin D as I can. I love you, 

Bella. 

I decided to kill an hour with non-school-related reading. I had a small collection of books that came 
with me to Forks, the shabbiest volume being a compilation of the works of Jane Austen. I selected that 
one and headed to the backyard, grabbing a ragged old quilt from the linen cupboard at the top of the 
stairs on my way down. 

Outside in Charlie's small, square yard, I folded the quilt in half and laid it out of the reach of the trees' 
shadows on the thick lawn that would always be slightly wet, no matter how long the sun shone. I lay on 
my stomach, crossing my ankles in the air, flipping through the different novels in the book, trying to 
decide which would occupy my mind the most thoroughly. My favorites were Pride and Prejudice and 
Sense and Sensibility. I'd read the first most recently, so I started into Sense and Sensibility, only to 
remember after I began three that the hero of the story happened to be named Edward. Angrily, I turned 
to Mansfield Park, but the hero of that piece was named Edmund, and that was just too close. Weren't 



there any other names available in the late eighteenth century? I snapped the book shut, annoyed, and 
rolled over onto my back. I pushed my sleeves up as high as they would go, and closed my eyes. I would 
think of nothing but the warmth on my skin, I told myself severely. The breeze was still light, but it blew 
tendrils of my hair around my face, and that tickled a bit. I pulled all my hair over my head, letting it fan 
out on the quilt above me, and focused again on the heat that touched my eyelids, my cheekbones, my 
nose, my lips, my forearms, my neck, soaked through my light shirt. . . 

The next thing I was conscious of was the sound of Charlie's cruiser turning onto the bricks of the 
driveway. I sat up in surprise, realizing the light was gone, behind the trees, and I had fallen asleep. I 
looked around, muddled, with the sudden feeling that I wasn't alone. 

"Charlie?" I asked. But I could hear his door slamming in front of the house. 

I jumped up, foolishly edgy, gathering the now-damp quilt and my book. I ran inside to get some oil 
heating on the stove, realizing that dinner would be late. Charlie was hanging up his gun belt and stepping 
out of his boots when I came in. 

"Sorry, Dad, dinner's not ready yet — I fell asleep outside." I stifled a yawn. 

"Don't worry about it," he said. "I wanted to catch the score on the game, anyway." 

I watched TV with Charlie after dinner, for something to do. There wasn't anything on I wanted to watch, 
but he knew I didn't like baseball, so he turned it to some mindless sitcom that neither of us enjoyed. He 
seemed happy, though, to be doing something together. And it felt good, despite my depression, to make 
him happy. 

"Dad," I said during a commercial, "Jessica and Angela are going to look at dresses for the dance 
tomorrow night in Port Angeles, and they wanted me to help them choose. . . do you mind if I go with 
them?" 

"Jessica Stanley?" he asked. 

"And Angela Weber." I sighed as I gave him the details. 
He was confused. "But you're not going to the dance, right?" 

"No, Dad, but I'm helping them find dresses — you know, giving them constructive criticism." I wouldn't 
have to explain this to a woman. 

"Well, okay." He seemed to realize that he was out of his depth with the girlie stuff. "It's a school night, 
though." 

"We'll leave right after school, so we can get back early. You'll be okay for dinner, right?" 
"Bells, I fed myself for seventeen years before you got here," he reminded me. 

"I don't know how you survived," I muttered, then added more clearly, "I'll leave some things for cold-cut 
sandwiches in the fridge, okay? Pdght on top." 

It was sunny again in the morning. I awakened with renewed hope that I grimly tried to suppress. I 
dressed for the warmer weather in a deep blue V-neck blouse — something I'd worn in the dead of 
winter in Phoenix. 

I had planned my arrival at school so that I barely had time to make it to class. With a sinking heart, I 



circled the full lot looking for a space, while also searching for the silver Volvo that was clearly not there. 
I parked in the last row and hurried to English, arriving breathless, but subdued, before the final bell. 

It was the same as yesterday — I just couldn't keep little sprouts of hope from budding in my mind, only 
to have them squashed painfully as I searched the lunchroom in vain and sat at my empty Biology table. 

The Port Angeles scheme was back on again for tonight and made all the more attractive by the fact that 
Lauren had other obligations. I was anxious to get out of town so I could stop glancing over my shoulder, 
hoping to see him appearing out of the blue the way he always did. I vowed to myself that I would be in a 
good mood tonight and not ruin Angela's or Jessica's enjoyment in the dress hunting. Maybe I could do a 
little clothes shopping as well. I refused to think that I might be shopping alone in Seattle this weekend, 
no longer interested in the earlier arrangement. Surely he wouldn't cancel without at least telling me. 

After school, Jessica followed me home in her old white Mercury so that I could ditch my books and 
truck. I brushed through my hair quickly when I was inside, feeling a slight lift of excitement as I 
contemplated getting out of Forks. I left a note for Charlie on the table, explaining again where to find 
dinner, switched my scruffy wallet from my school bag to a purse I rarely used, and ran out to join 
Jessica. We went to Angela's house next, and she was waiting for us. My excitement increased 
exponentially as we actually drove out of the town limits. 



8. PORT ANGELES 



Jess drove faster than the Chief, so we made it to Port Angeles by four. It had been a while since I'd had 
a girls' night out, and the estrogen rush was invigorating. We listened to whiny rock songs while Jessica 
jabbered on about the boys we hung out with. Jessica's dinner with Mike had gone very well, and she 
was hoping that by Saturday night they would have progressed to the first-kiss stage. I smiled to myself, 
pleased. Angela was passively happy to be going to the dance, but not really interested in Eric. Jess tried 
to get her to confess who her type was, but I interrupted with a question about dresses after a bit, to 
spare her. Angela threw a grateful glance my way. 

Port Angeles was a beautiful little tourist trap, much more polished and quaint than Forks. But Jessica 
and Angela knew it well, so they didn't plan to waste time on the picturesque boardwalk by the bay. Jess 
drove straight to the one big department store in town, which was a few streets in from the bay area's 
visitor-friendly face. 

The dance was billed as semiformal, and we weren't exactly sure what that meant. Both Jessica and 
Angela seemed surprised and almost disbelieving when I told them I'd never been to a dance in Phoenix. 

"Didn't you ever go with a boyfriend or something?" Jess asked dubiously as we walked through the front 
doors of the store. 

"Really," I tried to convince her, not wanting to confess my dancing problems. "I've never had a boyfriend 
or anything close. I didn't go out much." 

"Why not?" Jessica demanded. 

"No one asked me," I answered honestly. 

She looked skeptical. "People ask you out here," she reminded me, "and you tell them no." We were in 
the juniors' section now, scanning the racks for dress-up clothes. 



"Well, except for Tyler," Angela amended quietiy. 
"Excuse me?" I gasped. "What did you say?" 

"Tyler told everyone he's taking you to prom," Jessica informed me with suspicious eyes. 

"He said what?' I sounded like I was choking. 

"I told you it wasn't true," Angela murmured to Jessica. 

I was silent, still lost in shock that was quickly turning to irritation. But we had found the dress racks, and 
now we had work to do. 

"That's why Lauren doesn't like you," Jessica giggled while we pawed through the clothes. 

I ground my teeth. "Do you think that if I ran him over with my truck he would stop feeling guilty about 
the accident? That he might give up on making amends and call it even?" 

"Maybe," Jess snickered, '"//'that's why he's doing this." 

The dress selection wasn't large, but both of them found a few things to try on. I sat on a low chair just 
inside the dressing room, by the three-way mirror, trying to control my fuming. 

Jess was torn between two — one a long, strapless, basic black number, the other a knee-length electric 
blue with spaghetti straps. I encouraged her to go with the blue; why not play up the eyes? Angela chose 
a pale pink dress that draped around her tall frame nicely and brought out honey tints in her light brown 
hair. I complimented them both generously and helped by returning the rejects to their racks. The whole 
process was much shorter and easier than similar trips I'd taken with Renee at home. I guess there was 
something to be said for limited choices. 

We headed over to shoes and accessories. While they tried things on I merely watched and critiqued, not 
in the mood to shop for myself, though I did need new shoes. The girls'-night high was wearing off in the 
wake of my annoyance at Tyler, leaving room for the gloom to move back in. 

"Angela?" I began, hesitant, while she was trying on a pair of pink strappy heels — she was overjoyed to 
have a date tall enough that she could wear high heels at all. 

Jessica had drifted to the jewelry counter and we were alone. 

"Yes?" She held her leg out, twisting her ankle to get a better view of the shoe. 

I chickened out. "I like those." 

"I think I'll get them — though they'll never match anything but the one dress," she mused. 

"Oh, go ahead — they're on sale," I encouraged. She smiled, putting the lid back on a box that contained 
more practical-looking off-white shoes. 

I tried again. "Um, Angela. . . " She looked up curiously. 

"Is it normal for the. . . Cullens" — I kept my eyes on the shoes — "to be out of school a lot?" I failed 
miserably in my attempt to sound nonchalant. 

"Yes, when the weather is good they go backpacking all the time — even the doctor. They're all real 
outdoorsy," she told me quietiy, examining her shoes, too. She didn't ask one question, let alone the 



hundreds that Jessica would have unleashed. I was beginning to really like Angela. 

"Oh." I let the subject drop as Jessica returned to show us the rhinestone jewelry she'd found to match 
her silver shoes. 

We planned to go to dinner at a little Italian restaurant on the boardwalk, but the dress shopping hadn't 
taken as long as we'd expected. Jess and Angela were going to take their clothes back to the car and 
then walk down to the bay. I told them I would meet them at the restaurant in an hour — I wanted to 
look for a bookstore. They were both willing to come with me, but I encouraged them to go have fun — 
they didn't know how preoccupied I could get when surrounded by books; it was something I preferred 
to do alone. They walked off to the car chattering happily, and I headed in the direction Jess pointed out. 

I had no trouble finding the bookstore, but it wasn't what I was looking for. The windows were full of 
crystals, dream-catchers, and books about spiritual healing. I didn't even go inside. Through the glass I 
could see a fifty-year-old woman with long, gray hair worn straight down her back, clad in a dress right 
out of the sixties, smiling welcomingly from behind the counter. I decided that was one conversation I 
could skip. There had to be a normal bookstore in town. 

I meandered through the streets, which were filling up with end-of-the-workday traffic, and hoped I was 
headed toward downtown. I wasn't paying as much attention as I should to where I was going; I was 
wrestling with despair. I was trying so hard not to think about him, and what Angela had said. . . and 
more than anything trying to beat down my hopes for Saturday, fearing a disappointment more painful 
than the rest, when I looked up to see someone's silver Volvo parked along the street and it all came 
crashing down on me. Stupid, unreliable vampire, I thought to myself. 

I stomped along in a southerly direction, toward some glass-fronted shops that looked promising. But 
when I got to them, they were just a repair shop and a vacant space. I still had too much time to go 
looking for Jess and Angela yet, and I definitely needed to get my mood in hand before I met back up 
with them. I ran my fingers through my hair a couple of times and took some deep breaths before I 
continued around the comer. 

I started to realize, as I crossed another road, that I was going the wrong direction. The little foot traffic I 
had seen was going north, and it looked like the buildings here were mostly warehouses. I decided to 
turn east at the next comer, and then loop around after a few blocks and try my luck on a different street 
on my way back to the boardwalk. 

A group of four men turned around the comer I was heading for, dressed too casually to be heading 
home from the office, but they were too grimy to be tourists. As they approached me, I realized they 
weren't too many years older than I was. They were joking loudly among themselves, laughing raucously 
and punching each other's arms. I scooted as far to the inside of the sidewalk as I could to give them 
room, walking swiftly, looking past them to the comer. 

"Hey, there!" one of them called as they passed, and he had to be talking to me since no one else was 
around. I glanced up automatically. Two of them had paused, the other two were slowing. The closest, a 
heavyset, dark-haired man in his early twenties, seemed to be the one who had spoken. He was wearing 
a flannel shirt open over a dirty t-shirt, cut-off jeans, and sandals. He took half a step toward me. 

"Hello," I mumbled, a knee-jerk reaction. Then I quickly looked away and walked faster toward the 
comer. I could hear them laughing at full volume behind me. 

"Hey, wait! " one of them called after me again, but I kept my head down and rounded the comer with a 
sigh of relief . I could still hear them chortling behind me. 



I found myself on a sidewalk leading past the backs of several somber-colored warehouses, each with 
large bay doors for unloading trucks, padlocked for the night. The south side of the street had no 
sidewalk, only a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire protecting some kind of engine parts storage 
yard. I'd wandered far past the part of Port Angeles that I, as a guest, was intended to see. It was getting 
dark, I realized, the clouds finally returning, piling up on the western horizon, creating an early sunset. The 
eastern sky was still clear, but graying, shot through with streaks of pink and orange. I'd left my jacket in 
the car, and a sudden shiver made me cross my arms tightly across my chest. A single van passed me, 
and then the road was empty. 

The sky suddenly darkened further, and, as I looked over my shoulder to glare at the offending cloud, I 
realized with a shock that two men were walking quietly twenty feet behind me. 

They were from the same group I'd passed at the corner, though neither was the dark one who'd spoken 
to me. I turned my head forward at once, quickening my pace. A chill that had nothing to do with the 
weather made me shiver again. My purse was on a shoulder strap and I had it slung across my body, the 
way you were supposed to wear it so it wouldn't get snatched. I knew exactiy where my pepper spray 
was — still in my duffle bag under the bed, never unpacked. I didn't have much money with me, just a 
twenty and some ones, and I thought about "accidentally" dropping my bag and walking away. But a 
small, frightened voice in the back of my mind warned me that they might be something worse than 
thieves. 

I listened intently to their quiet footsteps, which were much too quiet when compared to the boisterous 
noise they'd been making earlier, and it didn't sound like they were speeding up, or getting any closer to 
me. Breathe, I had to remind myself. You don't know they're following you. I continued to walk as 
quickly as I could without actually running, focusing on the right-hand turn that was only a few yards 
away from me now. I could hear them, staying as far back as they'd been before. A blue car turned onto 
the street from the south and drove quickly past me. I thought of jumping out in front of it, but I hesitated, 
inhibited, unsure that I was really being pursued, and then it was too late. 

I reached the comer, but a swift glance revealed that it was only a blind drive to the back of another 
building. I was half-turned in anticipation; I had to hurriedly correct and dash across the narrow drive, 
back to the sidewalk. The street ended at the next comer, where there was a stop sign. I concentrated 
on the faint footsteps behind me, deciding whether or not to run. They sounded farther back, though, and 
I knew they could outrun me in any case. I was sure to trip and go sprawling if I tried to go any faster. 
The footfalls were definitely farther back. I risked a quick glance over my shoulder, and they were maybe 
forty feet back now, I saw with relief. But they were both staring at me. 

It seemed to take forever for me to get to the comer. I kept my pace steady, the men behind me falling 
ever so slightly farther behind with every step. Maybe they realized they had scared me and were sorry. I 
saw two cars going north pass the intersection I was heading for, and I exhaled in relief. There would be 
more people around once I got off this deserted street. I skipped around the comer with a grateful sigh. 

And skidded to a stop. 

The street was lined on both sides by blank, doorless, windowless walls. I could see in the distance, two 
intersections down, streetlamps, cars, and more pedestrians, but they were all too far away. Because 
lounging against the western building, midway down the street, were the other two men from the group, 
both watching with excited smiles as I froze dead on the sidewalk. I realized then that I wasn't being 
followed. 



I was being herded. 



I paused for only a second, but it felt like a very long time. I turned then and darted to the other side of 
the road. I had a sinking feeling that it was a wasted attempt. The footsteps behind me were louder now. 

"There you are!" The booming voice of the stocky, dark-haired man shattered the intense quiet and made 
me jump. In the gathering darkness, it seemed like he was looking past me. 

"Yeah," a voice called loudly from behind me, making me jump again as I tried to hurry down the street. 
"We just took a little detour." 

My steps had to slow now. I was closing the distance between myself and the lounging pair too quickly. I 
had a good loud scream, and I sucked in air, preparing to use it, but my throat was so dry I wasn't sure 
how much volume I could manage. With a quick movement I slipped my purse over my head, gripping 
the strap with one hand, ready to surrender it or use it as weapon as need demanded. 

The thickset man shrugged away from the wall as I warily came to a stop, and walked slowly into the 
street. 

"Stay away from me," I warned in a voice that was supposed to sound strong and fearless. But I was 
right about the dry throat — no volume. 

"Don't be like that, sugar," he called, and the raucous laughter started again behind me. 

I braced myself, feet apart, trying to remember through my panic what littie self-defense I knew. Heel of 
the hand thrust upward, hopefully breaking the nose or shoving it into the brain. Finger through the eye 
socket — try to hook around and pop the eye out. And the standard knee to the groin, of course. That 
same pessimistic voice in my mind spoke up then, reminding me that I probably wouldn't have a chance 
against one of them, and there were four. Shut up! I commanded the voice before terror could 
incapacitate me. I wasn't going out without taking someone with me. I tried to swallow so I could build 
up a decent scream. 

Headlights suddenly flew around the comer, the car almost hitting the stocky one, forcing him to jump 
back toward the sidewalk. I dove into the road — this car was going to stop, or have to hit me. But the 
silver car unexpectedly fishtailed around, skidding to a stop with the passenger door open just a few feet 
from me. 

"Get in," a furious voice commanded. 

It was amazing how instantaneously the choking fear vanished, amazing how suddenly the feeling of 
security washed over me — even before I was off the street — as soon as I heard his voice. I jumped 
into the seat, slamming the door shut behind me. 

It was dark in the car, no light had come on with the opening of the door, and I could barely see his face 
in the glow from the dashboard. The tires squealed as he spun around to face north, accelerating too 
quickly, swerving toward the stunned men on the street. I caught a glimpse of them diving for the 
sidewalk as we straightened out and sped toward the harbor. 

"Put on your seat belt," he commanded, and I realized I was clutching the seat with both hands. I quickly 
obeyed; the snap as the belt connected was loud in the darkness. He took a sharp left, racing forward, 
blowing through several stop signs without a pause. 

But I felt utterly safe and, for the moment, totally unconcerned about where we were going. I stared at his 
face in profound relief, relief that went beyond my sudden deliverance. I studied his flawless features in 
the limited light, waiting for my breath to return to normal, until it occurred to me that his expression was 



murderously angry. 

"Are you okay?" I asked, surprised at how hoarse my voice sounded. 
"No," he said curtly, and his tone was livid. 

I sat in silence, watching his face while his blazing eyes stared straight ahead, until the car came to a 
sudden stop. I glanced around, but it was too dark to see anything beside the vague outline of dark trees 
crowding the roadside. We weren't in town anymore. 

"Bella?" he asked, his voice tight, controlled. 

"Yes?" My voice was still rough. I tried to clear my throat quietly. 

"Are you all right?" He still didn't look at me, but the fury was plain on his face. 

"Yes," I croaked softly. 

"Distract me, please," he ordered. 

"I'm sorry, what?" 

He exhaled sharply. 

"Just prattle about something unimportant until I calm down," he clarified, closing his eyes and pinching 
the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger. 

"Urn." I wracked my brain for something trivial. "I'm going to run over Tyler Crowley tomorrow before 
school?" 

He was still squeezing his eyes closed, but the comer of his mouth twitched. 
"Why?" 

"He's telling everyone that he's taking me to prom — either he's insane or he's still trying to make up for 
almost killing me last. . . well, you remember it, and he thinks prom is somehow the correct way to do 
this. So I figure if I endanger his life, then we're even, and he can't keep trying to make amends. I don't 
need enemies and maybe Lauren would back off if he left me alone. I might have to total his Sentra, 
though. If he doesn't have a ride he can't take anyone to prom. . . " I babbled on. 

"I heard about that." He sounded a bit more composed. 

"You did?" I asked in disbelief, my previous irritation flaring. "If he's paralyzed from the neck down, he 
can't go to the prom, either," I muttered, refining my plan. 

Edward sighed, and finally opened his eyes. 

"Better?" 

"Not really." 

I waited, but he didn't speak again. He leaned his head back against the seat, staring at the ceiling of the 
car. His face was rigid. 

"What's wrong?" My voice came out in a whisper. 



"Sometimes I have a problem with my temper, Bella." He was whispering, too, and as he stared out the 
window, his eyes narrowed into slits. "But it wouldn 't be helpful for me to turn around and hunt down 
those. . . " He didn't finish his sentence, looking away, struggling for a moment to control his anger again. 
"At least," he continued, "that's what I'm trying to convince myself." 

"Oh." The word seemed inadequate, but I couldn't think of a better response. 

We sat in silence again. I glanced at the clock on the dashboard. It was past six-thirty. 

"Jessica and Angela will be worried," I murmured. "I was supposed to meet them." 

He started the engine without another word, turning around smoothly and speeding back toward town. 
We were under the streetlights in no time at all, still going too fast, weaving with ease through the cars 
slowly cruising the boardwalk. He parallel-parked against the curb in a space I would have thought much 
too small for the Volvo, but he slid in effortlessly in one try. I looked out the window to see the lights of 
La Bella Italia, and Jess and Angela just leaving, pacing anxiously away from us. 

"How did you know where. . . ?" I began, but then I just shook my head. I heard the door open and 
turned to see him getting out. 

"What are you doing?" I asked. 

"I'm taking you to dinner." He smiled slightiy, but his eyes were hard. He stepped out of the car and 
slammed the door. I fumbled with my seat belt, and then hurried to get out of the car as well. He was 
waiting for me on the sidewalk. 

He spoke before I could. "Go stop Jessica and Angela before I have to track them down, too. I don't 
think I could restrain myself if I ran into your other friends again." 

I shivered at the threat in his voice. 

" Jess ! Angela ! " I yelled after them, waving when they turned. They rushed back to me, the pronounced 
relief on both their faces simultaneously changing to surprise as they saw who I was standing next to. 
They hesitated a few feet from us. 

"Where have you been?" Jessica's voice was suspicious. 

"I got lost," I admitted sheepishly. "And then I ran into Edward." I gestured toward him. 

"Would it be all right if I joined you?" he asked in his silken, irresistible voice. I could see from their 
staggered expressions that he had never unleashed his talents on them before. 

"Er. . . sure," Jessica breathed. 

"Urn, actually, Bella, we already ate while we were waiting — sorry," Angela confessed. 
"That's fine — I'm not hungry." I shrugged. 

"I think you should eat something." Edward's voice was low, but full of authority. He looked up at Jessica 
and spoke slightiy louder. "Do you mind if I drive Bella home tonight? That way you won't have to wait 
while she eats." 

"Uh, no problem, I guess ..." She bit her lip, trying to figure out from my expression whether that was 
what I wanted. I winked at her. I wanted nothing more than to be alone with my perpetual savior. There 
were so many questions that I couldn't bombard him with till we were by ourselves. 



"Okay." Angela was quicker than Jessica. "See you tomorrow, Bella. . . Edward." She grabbed Jessica's 
hand and pulled her toward the car, which I could see a little ways away, parked across First Street. As 
they got in, Jess turned and waved, her face eager with curiosity. I waved back, waiting for them to drive 
away before I turned to face him. 

"Honestly, I'm not hungry," I insisted, looking up to scrutinize his face. His expression was unreadable. 
"Humor me." 

He walked to the door of the restaurant and held it open with an obstinate expression. Obviously, there 
would be no further discussion. I walked past him into the restaurant with a resigned sigh. 

The restaurant wasn't crowded — it was the off-season in Port Angeles. The host was female, and I 
understood the look in her eyes as she assessed Edward. She welcomed him a little more warmly than 
necessary. I was surprised by how much that bothered me. She was several inches taller than I was, and 
unnaturally blond. 

"A table for two?" His voice was alluring, whether he was aiming for that or not. I saw her eyes flicker to 
me and then away, satisfied by my obvious ordinariness, and by the cautious, no-contact space Edward 
kept between us. She led us to a table big enough for four in the center of the most crowded area of the 
dining floor. 

I was about to sit, but Edward shook his head at me. 

"Perhaps something more private?" he insisted quietly to the host. I wasn't sure, but it looked like he 
smoothly handed her a tip. I'd never seen anyone refuse a table except in old movies. 

"Sure." She sounded as surprised as I was. She turned and led us around a partition to a small ring of 
booths — all of them empty. "How's this?" 

"Perfect." He flashed his gleaming smile, dazing her momentarily. 

"Urn" — she shook her head, bhnking — "your server will be right out." She walked away unsteadily. 
"You really shouldn't do that to people," I criticized. "It's hardly fair." 
"Do what?" 

"Dazzle them like that — she's probably hyperventilating in the kitchen right now." 
He seemed confused. 

"Oh, come on," I said dubiously. "You have to know the effect you have on people." 
He tilted his head to one side, and his eyes were curious. "I dazzle people?" 
"You haven't noticed? Do you think everybody gets their way so easily?" 
He ignored my questions. "Do I dazzle vow?" 
"Frequentiy," I admitted. 

And then our server arrived, her face expectant. The hostess had definitely dished behind the scenes, and 
this new girl didn't look disappointed. She flipped a strand of short black hair behind one ear and smiled 
with unnecessary warmth. 



"Hello. My name is Amber, and I'll be your server tonight. What can I get you to drink?" I didn't miss 
that she was speaking only to him. 

He looked at me. 

"I'll have a Coke." It sounded like a question. 
"Two Cokes," he said. 

"I'll be right back with that," she assured him with another unnecessary smile. But he didn't see it. He was 
watching me. 

"What?" I asked when she left. 

His eyes stayed fixed on my face. "How are you feeling?" 
"I'm fine," I replied, surprised by his intensity. 
"You don't feel dizzy, sick, cold. . . ?" 
"Should I?" 

He chuckled at my puzzled tone. 

"Well, I'm actually waiting for you to go into shock." His face twisted up into that perfect crooked smile. 

"I don't think that will happen," I said after I could breathe again. "I've always been very good at 
repressing unpleasant things." 

"Just the same, I'll feel better when you have some sugar and food in you." 

Right on cue, the waitress appeared with our drinks and a basket of breadsticks. She stood with her 
back to me as she placed them on the table. 

"Are you ready to order?" she asked Edward. 

"Bella?" he asked. She turned unwillingly toward me. 

I picked the first thing I saw on the menu. "Urn. . . I'll have the mushroom ravioli." 
"And you?" She turned back to him with a smile. 
"Nothing for me," he said. Of course not. 

"Let me know if you change your mind." The coy smile was still in place, but he wasn't looking at her, 
and she left dissatisfied. 

"Drink," he ordered. 

I sipped at my soda obediently, and then drank more deeply, surprised by how thirsty I was. I realized I 
had finished the whole thing when he pushed his glass toward me. 

"Thanks," I muttered, still thirsty. The cold from the icy soda was radiating through my chest, and I 
shivered. 

"Are you cold?" 



"It's just the Coke," I explained, shivering again. 
"Don't you have a jacket?" His voice was disapproving. 

"Yes." I looked at the empty bench next to me. "Oh — I left it in Jessica's car," I realized. 

Edward was shrugging out of his jacket. I suddenly realized that I had never once noticed what he was 
wearing — not just tonight, but ever. I just couldn't seem to look away from his face. I made myself look 
now, focusing. He was removing a light beige leather jacket now; underneath he wore an ivory turtleneck 
sweater. It fit him snugly, emphasizing how muscular his chest was. 

He handed me the jacket, interrupting my ogling. 

"Thanks," I said again, sliding my arms into his jacket. It was cold — the way my jacket felt when I first 
picked it up in the morning, hanging in the drafty hallway. I shivered again. It smelled amazing. I inhaled, 
trying to identify the delicious scent. It didn't smell like cologne. The sleeves were much too long; I 
shoved them back so I could free my hands. 

"That color blue looks lovely with your skin," he said, watching me. I was surprised; I looked down, 
flushing, of course. 

He pushed the bread basket toward me. 
"Really, I'm not going into shock," I protested. 

"You should be — a normal person would be. You don't even look shaken." He seemed unsettled. He 
stared into my eyes, and I saw how light his eyes were, lighter than I'd ever seen them, golden 
butterscotch. 

"I feel very safe with you," I confessed, mesmerized into telling the truth again. 
That displeased him; his alabaster brow furrowed. He shook his head, frowning. 
"This is more complicated than I'd planned," he murmured to himself. 

I picked up a breadstick and began nibbling on the end, measuring his expression. I wondered when it 
would be okay to start questioning him. 

"Usually you're in a better mood when your eyes are so light," I commented, trying to distract him from 
whatever thought had left him frowning and somber. 

He stared at me, stunned. "What?" 

"You're always crabbier when your eyes are black — I expect it then," I went on. "I have a theory about 
that." 

His eyes narrowed. "More theories?" 

"Mm-hm." I chewed on a small bite of the bread, trying to look indifferent. 

"I hope you were more creative this time. . . or are you still stealing from comic books?" His faint smile 
was mocking; his eyes were still tight. 

"Well, no, I didn't get it from a comic book, but I didn't come up with it on my own, either," I confessed. 



"And?" he prompted. 

But then the waitress strode around the partition with my food. I realized we'd been unconsciously 
leaning toward each other across the table, because we both straightened up as she approached. She set 
the dish in front of me — it looked pretty good — and turned quickly to Edward. 

"Did you change your mind?" she asked. "Isn't there anything I can get you?" I may have been imagining 
the double meaning in her words. 

"No, thank you, but some more soda would be nice." He gestured with a long white hand to the empty 
cups in front of me. 

"Sure." She removed the empty glasses and walked away. 

"You were saying?" he asked. 

"I'll tell you about it in the car. If . . . " I paused. 

"There are conditions?" He raised one eyebrow, his voice ominous. 

"I do have a few questions, of course." 

"Of course." 

The waitress was back with two more Cokes. She sat them down without a word this time, and left 
again. 

I took a sip. 

"Well, go ahead," he pushed, his voice still hard. 

I started with the most undemanding. Or so I thought. "Why are you in Port Angeles?" 

He looked down, folding his large hands together slowly on the table. His eyes flickered up at me from 
under his lashes, the hint of a smirk on his face. 

"Next." 

"But that's the easiest one," I objected. 
"Next," he repeated. 

I looked down, frustrated. I unrolled my silverware, picked up my fork, and carefully speared a ravioli. I 
put it in my mouth slowly, still looking down, chewing while I thought. The mushrooms were good. I 
swallowed and took another sip of Coke before I looked up. 

"Okay, then." I glared at him, and continued slowly. "Let's say, hypothetically of course, that. . . 
someone. . . could know what people are thinking, read minds, you know — with a few exceptions." 

"Just one exception," he corrected, "hypothetically." 

"All right, with one exception, then." I was thrilled that he was playing along, but I tried to seem casual. 

"How does that work? What are the Umitations? How would. . . that someone. . . find someone else at 
exactly the right time? How would he know she was in trouble?" I wondered if my convoluted questions 
even made sense. 



"Hypothetically?" he asked. 
"Sure." 

"Well, if. . . that someone. . . " 
"Let's call him 'Joe,'" I suggested. 

He smiled wryly. "Joe, then. If Joe had been paying attention, the timing wouldn't have needed to be quite 
so exact." He shook his head, rolling his eyes. "Only you could get into trouble in a town this small. You 
would have devastated their crime rate statistics for a decade, you know." 

"We were speaking of a hypothetical case," I reminded him frostily. 

He laughed at me, his eyes warm. 

"Yes, we were," he agreed. "Shall we call you 'Jane'?" 

"How did you know?" I asked, unable to curb my intensity. I realized I was leaning toward him again. 

He seemed to be wavering, torn by some internal dilemma. His eyes locked with mine, and I guessed he 
was making the decision right then whether or not to simply tell me the truth. 

"You can trust me, you know," I murmured. I reached forward, without thinking, to touch his folded 
hands, but he slid them away minutely, and I pulled my hand back. 

"I don't know if I have a choice anymore." His voice was almost a whisper. "I was wrong — you're much 
more observant than I gave you credit for." 

"I thought you were always right." 

"I used to be." He shook his head again. "I was wrong about you on one other thing, as well. You're not 
a magnet for accidents — that's not a broad enough classification. You are a magnet for trouble. If there 
is anything dangerous within a ten-mile radius, it will invariably find you." 

"And you put yourself into that category?" I guessed. 

His face turned cold, expressionless. "Unequivocally." 

I stretched my hand across the table again — ignoring him when he pulled back slightly once more — to 
touch the back of his hand shyly with my fingertips. His skin was cold and hard, like a stone. 

"Thank you." My voice was fervent with gratitude. "That's twice now." 

His face softened. "Let's not try for three, agreed?" 

I scowled, but nodded. He moved his hand out from under mine, placing both of his under the table. But 
he leaned toward me. 

"I followed you to Port Angeles," he admitted, speaking in a rush. "I've never tried to keep a specific 
person alive before, and it's much more troublesome than I would have believed. But that's probably just 
because it's you. Ordinary people seem to make it through the day without so many catastrophes." He 
paused. I wondered if it should bother me that he was following me; instead I felt a strange surge of 
pleasure. He stared, maybe wondering why my lips were curving into an involuntary smile. 



"Did you ever think that maybe my number was up the first time, with the van, and that you've been 
interfering with fate?" I speculated, distracting myself. 

"That wasn't the first time," he said, and his voice was hard to hear. I stared at him in amazement, but he 
was looking down. "Your number was up the first time I met you." 

I felt a spasm of fear at his words, and the abrupt memory of his violent black glare that first day. . . but 
the overwhelming sense of safety I felt in his presence stifled it. By the time he looked up to read my 
eyes, there was no trace of fear in them. 

"You remember?" he asked, his angel's face grave. 

"Yes." I was calm. 

"And yet here you sit." There was a trace of disbelief in his voice; he raised one eyebrow. 

"Yes, here I sit. . . because of you." I paused. "Because somehow you knew how to find me today. . . ?" I 
prompted. 

He pressed his lips together, staring at me through narrowed eyes, deciding again. His eyes flashed down 
to my full plate, and then back to me. 

"You eat, I'll talk," he bargained. 

I quickly scooped up another ravioli and popped it in my mouth. 

"It's harder than it should be — keeping track of you. Usually I can find someone very easily, once I've 
heard their mind before." He looked at me anxiously, and I realized I had frozen. I made myself swallow, 
then stabbed another ravioli and tossed it in. 

"I was keeping tabs on Jessica, not carefully — like I said, only you could find trouble in Port Angeles — 
and at first I didn't notice when you took off on your own. Then, when I realized that you weren't with 
her anymore, I went looking for you at the bookstore I saw in her head. I could tell that you hadn't gone 
in, and that you'd gone south. . . and I knew you would have to turn around soon. So I was just waiting 
for you, randomly searching through the thoughts of people on the street — to see if anyone had noticed 
you so I would know where you were. I had no reason to be worried. . . but I was strangely anxious. . . " 
He was lost in thought, staring past me, seeing things I couldn't imagine. 

"I started to drive in circles, still. . . Ustening. The sun was finally setting, and I was about to get out and 
follow you on foot. And then — " He stopped, clenching his teeth together in sudden fury. He made an 
effort to calm himself. 

"Then what?" I whispered. He continued to stare over my head. 

"I heard what they were thinking," he growled, his upper Up curling slightly back over his teeth. "I saw 
your face in his mind." He suddenly leaned forward, one elbow appearing on the table, his hand covering 
his eyes. The movement was so swift it startled me. 

"It was very. . . hard — you can't imagine how hard — for me to simply take you away, and leave 
them. . . alive." His voice was muffled by his arm. "I could have let you go with Jessica and Angela, but I 
was afraid if you left me alone, I would go looking for them," he admitted in a whisper. 

I sat quietly, dazed, my thoughts incoherent. My hands were folded in my lap, and I was leaning weakly 
against the back of the seat. He still had his face in his hand, and he was as still as if he'd been carved 



from the stone his skin resembled. 

Finally he looked up, his eyes seeking mine, full of his own questions. 
"Are you ready to go home?" he asked. 

"I'm ready to leave," I qualified, overly grateful that we had the hour-long ride home together. I wasn't 
ready to say goodbye to him. 

The waitress appeared as if she'd been called. Or watching. 
"How are we doing?" she asked Edward. 

"We're ready for the check, thank you." His voice was quiet, rougher, still reflecting the strain of our 
conversation. It seemed to muddle her. He looked up, waiting. 

"S-sure," she stuttered. "Here you go." She pulled a small leather folder from the front pocket of her 
black apron and handed it to him. 

There was a bill in his hand already. He slipped it into the folder and handed it right back to her. 

"No change." He smiled. Then he stood up, and I scrambled awkwardly to my feet. 

She smiled invitingly at him again. "You have a nice evening." 

He didn't look away from me as he thanked her. I suppressed a smile. 

He walked close beside me to the door, still careful not to touch me. I remembered what Jessica had 
said about her relationship with Mike, how they were almost to the first-kiss stage. I sighed. Edward 
seemed to hear me, and he looked down curiously. I looked at the sidewalk, grateful that he didn't seem 
to be able to know what I was thinking. 

He opened the passenger door, holding it for me as I stepped in, shutting it softly behind me. I watched 
him walk around the front of the car, amazed, yet again, by how graceful he was. I probably should have 
been used to that by now — but I wasn't. I had a feeling Edward wasn't the kind of person anyone got 
used to. 

Once inside the car, he started the engine and turned the heater on high. It had gotten very cold, and I 
guessed the good weather was at an end. I was warm in his jacket, though, breathing in the scent of it 
when I thought he couldn't see. 

Edward pulled out through the traffic, apparently without a glance, flipping around to head toward the 
freeway. 

"Now," he said significantly, "it's your turn." 
9. THEORY 



"Can I ask just one more?" I pleaded as Edward accelerated much too quickly down the quiet street. He 
didn't seem to be paying any attention to the road. 



He sighed. 



"One," he agreed. His lips pressed together into a cautious line. 

"Well. . . you said you knew I hadn't gone into the bookstore, and that I had gone south. I was just 
wondering how you knew that." 

He looked away, deliberating. 

"I thought we were past all the evasiveness," I grumbled. 
He almost smiled. 

"Fine, then. I followed your scent." He looked at the road, giving me time to compose my face. I couldn't 
think of an acceptable response to that, but I filed it carefully away for future study. I tried to refocus. I 
wasn't ready to let him be finished, now that he was finally explaining things. 

"And then you didn't answer one of my first questions. . ." I stalled. 

He looked at me with disapproval. "Which one?" 

"How does it work — the mind-reading thing? Can you read anybody's mind, anywhere? How do you 
do it? Can the rest of your family. . . ?" I felt silly, asking for clarification on make-believe. 

"That's more than one," he pointed out. I simply intertwined my fingers and gazed at him, waiting. 

"No, it's just me. And I can't hear anyone, anywhere. I have to be fairly close. The more farniliar 
someone's. . . 'voice' is, the farther away I can hear them. But still, no more than a few miles." He paused 
thoughtfully. "It's a little like being in a huge hall filled with people, everyone talking at once. It's just a hum 
— a buzzing of voices in the background. Until I focus on one voice, and then what they're thinking is 
clear. 

"Most of the time I tune it all out — it can be very distracting. And then it's easier to seem normal" — 
he frowned as he said the word — "when I'm not accidentally answering someone's thoughts rather than 
their words." 

"Why do you think you can't hear me?" I asked curiously. 
He looked at me, his eyes enigmatic. 

"I don't know," he murmured. "The only guess I have is that maybe your mind doesn't work the same 
way the rest of theirs do. Like your thoughts are on the AM frequency and I'm only getting FM." He 
grinned at me, suddenly amused. 

"My mind doesn't work right? I'm a freak?" The words bothered me more than they should — probably 
because his speculation hit home. I'd always suspected as much, and it embarrassed me to have it 
confirmed. 

"I hear voices in my mind and you're worried that you 're the freak," he laughed. "Don't worry, it's just a 
theory. . ." His face tightened. "Which brings us back to you." 

I sighed. How to begin? 

"Aren't we past all the evasions now?" he reminded me softly. 

I looked away from his face for the first time, trying to find words. I happened to notice the speedometer. 



"Holy crow!" I shouted. "Slow down!" 

"What's wrong?" He was startled. But the car didn't decelerate. 

"You're going a hundred miles an hour!" I was still shouting. I shot a panicky glance out the window, but 
it was too dark to see much. The road was only visible in the long patch of bluish brightness from the 
headlights. The forest along both sides of the road was like a black wall — as hard as a wall of steel if 
we veered off the road at this speed. 

"Relax, Bella." He rolled his eyes, still not slowing. 

"Are you trying to kill us?" I demanded. 

"We're not going to crash." 

I tried to modulate my voice. "Why are you in such a hurry?" 
"I always drive like this." He turned to smile crookedly at me. 
"Keep your eyes on the road!" 

"I've never been in an accident, Bella — I've never even gotten a ticket." He grinned and tapped his 
forehead. "Built-in radar detector." 

"Very funny." I fumed. "Charlie's a cop, remember? I was raised to abide by traffic laws. Besides, if you 
turn us into a Volvo pretzel around a tree trunk, you can probably just walk away." 

"Probably," he agreed with a short, hard laugh. "But you can't." He sighed, and I watched with relief as 
the needle gradually drifted toward eighty. "Happy?" 

"Almost." 

"I hate driving slow," he muttered. 
"This is slow?" 

"Enough commentary on my driving," he snapped. "I'm still waiting for your latest theory." 

I bit my hp. He looked down at me, his honey eyes unexpectedly gentle. 

"I won't laugh," he promised. 

"I'm more afraid that you'll be angry with me." 

"Is it that bad?" 

"Pretty much, yeah." 

He waited. I was looking down at my hands, so I couldn't see his expression. 

"Go ahead." His voice was calm. 

"I don't know how to start," I admitted. 

"Why don't you start at the beginning. . . you said you didn't come up with this on your own." 



"No." 

"What got you started — a book? A movie?" he probed. 

"No — it was Saturday, at the beach." I risked a glance up at his face. He looked puzzled. 

"I ran into an old family friend — Jacob Black," I continued. "His dad and Charlie have been friends since 
I was a baby." 

He still looked confused. 

"His dad is one of the Quileute elders." I watched him carefully. His confused expression froze in place. 
"We went for a walk — " I edited all my scheming out of the story " — and he was telling me some old 
legends — trying to scare me, I think. He told me one. . . " I hesitated. 

"Go on," he said. 

"About vampires." I realized I was whispering. I couldn't look at his face now. But I saw his knuckles 
tighten convulsively on the wheel. 

"And you immediately thought of me?" Still calm. 

"No. He. . . mentioned your family." 

He was silent, staring at the road. 

I was worried suddenly, worried about protecting Jacob. 

"He just thought it was a silly superstition," I said quickly. "He didn't expect me to think anything of it." It 
didn't seem like enough; I had to confess. "It was my fault, I forced him to tell me." 

"Why?" 

"Lauren said something about you — she was trying to provoke me. And an older boy from the tribe 
said your family didn't come to the reservation, only it sounded like he meant something different. So I 
got Jacob alone and I tricked it out of him," I admitted, hanging my head. 

He startled me by laughing. I glared up at him. He was laughing, but his eyes were fierce, staring ahead. 
"Tricked him how?" he asked. 

"I tried to flirt — it worked better than I thought it would." Disbelief colored my tone as I remembered. 

"I'd like to have seen that." He chuckled darkly. "And you accused me of dazzling people — poor Jacob 
Black." 

I blushed and looked out my window into the night. 
"What did you do then?" he asked after a minute. 
"I did some research on the Internet." 

"And did that convince you?" His voice sounded barely interested. But his hands were clamped hard 
onto the steering wheel. 

"No. Nothing fit. Most of it was kind of silly. And then. . . " I stopped. 



"What?" 

"I decided it didn't matter," I whispered. 

"It didn't matter!" His tone made me look up — I had finally broken through his carefully composed 
mask. His face was incredulous, with just a hint of the anger I'd feared. 

"No," I said softly. "It doesn't matter to me what you are." 

A hard, mocking edge entered his voice. "You don't care if I'm a monster? If I'm not human !" 
"No." 

He was silent, staring straight ahead again. His face was bleak and cold. 
"You're angry," I sighed. "I shouldn't have said anything." 

"No," he said, but his tone was as hard as his face. "I'd rather know what you're thinking — even if what 
you're tMnking is insane." 

"So I'm wrong again?" I challenged. 

"That's not what I was referring to. It doesn't matter'!" he quoted, gritting his teeth together. 
"I'm right?" I gasped. 
"Does it matter?' 
I took a deep breath. 

"Not really." I paused. "But I am curious." My voice, at least, was composed. 

He was suddenly resigned. "What are you curious about?" 

"How old are you?" 

"Seventeen," he answered promptly. 

"And how long have you been seventeen?" 

His lips twitched as he stared at the road. "A while," he admitted at last. 

"Okay." I smiled, pleased that he was still being honest with me. He stared down at me with watchful 
eyes, much as he had before, when he was worried I would go into shock. I smiled wider in 
encouragement, and he frowned. 

"Don't laugh — but how can you come out during the daytime?" 
He laughed anyway. "Myth." 
"Burned by the sun?" 
"Myth." 

"Sleeping in coffins?" 

"Myth." He hesitated for a moment, and a peculiar tone entered his voice. "I can't sleep." 



It took me a minute to absorb that. "At all?" 

"Never," he said, his voice nearly inaudible. He turned to look at me with a wistful expression. The 
golden eyes held mine, and I lost my train of thought. I stared at him until he looked away. 

"You haven't asked me the most important question yet." His voice was hard now, and when he looked 
at me again his eyes were cold. 

I blinked, still dazed. "Which one is that?" 

"You aren't concerned about my diet?" he asked sarcastically. 

"Oh," I murmured, "that." 

"Yes, that." His voice was bleak. "Don't you want to know if I drink blood?" 
I flinched. "Well, Jacob said something about that." 
"What did Jacob say?" he asked flatly. 

"He said you didn't. . . hunt people. He said your family wasn't supposed to be dangerous because you 
only hunted animals." 

"He said we weren't dangerous?" His voice was deeply skeptical. 

"Not exactly. He said you weren't supposed to be dangerous. But the Quileutes still didn't want you on 
their land, just in case." 

He looked forward, but I couldn't tell if he was watching the road or not. 

"So was he right? About not hunting people?" I tried to keep my voice as even as possible. 

"The Quileutes have a long memory," he whispered. 

I took it as a confirmation. 

"Don't let that make you complacent, though," he warned me. "They're right to keep their distance from 
us. We are still dangerous." 

"I don't understand." 

"We try," he explained slowly. "We're usually very good at what we do. Sometimes we make mistakes. 
Me, for example, allowing myself to be alone with you." 

"This is a mistake?" I heard the sadness in my voice, but I didn't know if he could as well. 
"A very dangerous one," he murmured. 

We were both silent then. I watched the headlights twist with the curves of the road. They moved too 
fast; it didn't look real, it looked like a video game. I was aware of the time slipping away so quickly, like 
the black road beneath us, and I was hideously afraid that I would never have another chance to be with 
him like this again — openly, the walls between us gone for once. His words hinted at an end, and I 
recoiled from the idea. I couldn't waste one minute I had with him. 

"Tell me more," I asked desperately, not caring what he said, just so I could hear his voice again. 



He looked at me quickly, startled by the change in my tone. "What more do you want to know?" 

"Tell me why you hunt animals instead of people," I suggested, my voice still tinged with desperation. I 
realized my eyes were wet, and I fought against the grief that was trying to overpower me. 

"I don't want to be a monster." His voice was very low. 

"But animals aren't enough?" 

He paused. "I can't be sure, of course, but I'd compare it to living on torn and soy milk; we call ourselves 
vegetarians, our little inside joke. It doesn't completely satiate the hunger — or rather thirst. But it keens 
us strong enough to resist. Most of the time." His tone turned ominous. "Sometimes it's more difficult than 
others." 

"Is it very difficult for you now?" I asked. 
He sighed. "Yes." 

"But you're not hungry now," I said confidentiy — stating, not asking. 
"Why do you think that?" 

"Your eyes. I told you I had a theory. I've noticed that people — men in particular — are crabbier when 
they're hungry." 

He chuckled. "You are observant, aren't you?" 

I didn't answer; I just listened to the sound of his laugh, committing it to memory. 

"Were you hunting this weekend, with Emmett?" I asked when it was quiet again. 

"Yes." He paused for a second, as if deciding whether or not to say something. "I didn't want to leave, 
but it was necessary. It's a bit easier to be around you when I'm not thirsty." 

"Why didn't you want to leave?" 

"It makes me. . . anxious. . . to be away from you." His eyes were gentle but intense, and they seemed to 
be making my bones turn soft. "I wasn't joking when I asked you to try not to fall in the ocean or get run 
over last Thursday. I was distracted all weekend, worrying about you. And after what happened tonight, 
I'm surprised that you did make it through a whole weekend unscathed." He shook his head, and then 
seemed to remember something. "Well, not totally unscathed." 

"What?" 

"Your hands," he reminded me. I looked down at my palms, at the almost-healed scrapes across the 
heels of my hands. His eyes missed nothing. 

"I fell," I sighed. 

"That's what I thought." His lips curved up at the comers. "I suppose, being you, it could have been much 
worse — and that possibility tormented me the entire time I was away. It was a very long three days. I 
really got on Emmett's nerves." He smiled ruefully at me. 



"Three days? Didn't you just get back today?" 



"No, we got back Sunday." 

"Then why weren't any of you in school?" I was frustrated, almost angry as I thought of how much 
disappointment I had suffered because of his absence. 

"Well, you asked if the sun hurt me, and it doesn't. But I can't go out in the sunlight — at least, not where 
anyone can see." 

"Why?" 

"I'll show you sometime," he promised. 
I thought about it for a moment. 
"You might have called me," I decided. 
He was puzzled. "But I knew you were safe." 

"But / didn't know where you were. I — " I hesitated, dropping my eyes. 
"What?" His velvety voice was compelling. 

"I didn't like it. Not seeing you. It makes me anxious, too." I blushed to be saying this out loud. 

He was quiet. I glanced up, apprehensive, and saw that his expression was pained. 

"Ah," he groaned quietly. "This is wrong." 

I couldn't understand his response. "What did I say?" 

"Don't you see, Bella? It's one thing for me to make myself miserable, but a wholly other thing for you to 
be so involved." He turned his anguished eyes to the road, his words flowing almost too fast for me to 
understand. "I don't want to hear that you feel that way." His voice was low but urgent. His words cut 
me. "It's wrong. It's not safe. I'm dangerous, Bella — please, grasp that." 

"No." I tried very hard not to look like a sulky child. 

"I'm serious," he growled. 

"So am 1. 1 told you, it doesn't matter what you are. It's too late." 
His voice whipped out, low and harsh. "Never say that." 

I bit my hp and was glad he couldn't know how much that hurt. I stared out at the road. We must be 
close now. He was driving much too fast. 

"What are you thinking?" he asked, his voice still raw. I just shook my head, not sure if I could speak. I 
could feel his gaze on my face, but I kept my eyes forward. 

"Are you crying?" He sounded appalled. I hadn't realized the moisture in my eyes had brimmed over. I 
quickly rubbed my hand across my cheek, and sure enough, traitor tears were there, betraying me. 

"No," I said, but my voice cracked. 

I saw him reach toward me hesitantiy with his right hand, but then he stopped and placed it slowly back 
on the steering wheel. 



"I'm sorry." His voice burned with regret. I knew he wasn't just apologizing for the words that had upset 
me. 

The darkness slipped by us in silence. 

"Tell me something," he asked after another minute, and I could hear him struggle to use a lighter tone. 
"Yes?" 

"What were you thinking tonight, just before I came around the comer? I couldn't understand your 
expression — you didn't look that scared, you looked like you were concentrating very hard on 
something." 

"I was trying to remember how to incapacitate an attacker — you know, self-defense. I was going to 
smash his nose into his brain." I thought of the dark-haired man with a surge of hate. 

"You were going to fight them?" This upset him. "Didn't you think about running?" 

"I fall down a lot when I run," I admitted. 

"What about screaming for help?" 

"I was getting to that part." 

He shook his head. "You were right — I'm definitely fighting fate trying to keep you alive." 

I sighed. We were slowing, passing into the boundaries of Forks. It had taken less than twenty minutes. 

"Will I see you tomorrow?" I demanded. 

"Yes — I have a paper due, too." He smiled. "I'll save you a seat at lunch." 

It was silly, after everything we'd been through tonight, how that little promise sent flutters through my 
stomach, and made me unable to speak. 

We were in front of Charlie's house. The lights were on, my truck in its place, everything utterly normal. It 
was like waking from a dream. He stopped the car, but I didn't move. 

"Do you promise to be there tomorrow?" 

"I promise." 

I considered that for a moment, then nodded. I pulled his jacket off, taking one last whiff. 
"You can keep it — you don't have a jacket for tomorrow," he reminded me. 
I handed it back to him. "I don't want to have to explain to Charlie." 
"Oh, right." He grinned. 

I hesitated, my hand on the door handle, trying to prolong the moment. 
"Bella?" he asked in a different tone — serious, but hesitant. 
"Yes?" I turned back to him too eagerly. 



"Will you promise me something?" 

"Yes," I said, and instantly regretted my unconditional agreement. What if he asked me to stay away from 
him? I couldn't keep that promise. 

"Don't go into the woods alone." 

I stared at him in blank confusion. "Why?" 

He frowned, and his eyes were tight as he stared past me out the window. 
"I'm not always the most dangerous thing out there. Let's leave it at that." 

I shuddered slightly at the sudden bleakness in his voice, but I was relieved. This, at least, was an easy 
promise to honor. "Whatever you say." 

"I'll see you tomorrow," he sighed, and I knew he wanted me to leave now. 
"Tomorrow, then." I opened the door unwillingly. 

"Bella?" I turned and he was leaning toward me, his pale, glorious face just inches from mine. My heart 
stopped beating. 

"Sleep well," he said. His breath blew in my face, stunning me. It was the same exquisite scent that clung 
to his jacket, but in a more concentrated form. I blinked, thoroughly dazed. He leaned away. 

I was unable to move until my brain had somewhat unscrambled itself. Then I stepped out of the car 
awkwardly, having to use the frame for support. I thought I heard him chuckle, but the sound was too 
quiet for me to be certain. 

He waited till I had stumbled to the front door, and then I heard his engine quietiy rev. I turned to watch 
the silver car disappear around the corner. I realized it was very cold. 

I reached for the key mechanically, unlocked the door, and stepped inside. 

Charlie called from the living room. "Bella?" 

"Yeah, Dad, it's me." I walked in to see him. He was watching a baseball game. 
"You're home early." 
"Am I?" I was surprised. 

"It's not even eight yet," he told me. "Did you girls have fun?" 

"Yeah — it was lots of fun." My head was spinning as I tried to remember all the way back to the girls' 
night out I had planned. "They both found dresses." 

"Are you all right?" 

"I'm just tired. I did a lot of walking." 

"Well, maybe you should go he down." He sounded concerned. I wondered what my face looked like. 
"I'm just going to call Jessica first." 



"Weren't you just with her?" he asked, surprised. 



"Yes — but I left my jacket in her car. I want to make sure she brings it tomorrow." 
"Well, give her a chance to get home first." 
"Right," I agreed. 

I went to the kitchen and fell, exhausted, into a chair. I was really feeling dizzy now. I wondered if I was 
going to go into shock after all. Get a grip, I told myself. 

The phone rang suddenly, startling me. I yanked it off the hook. 

"Hello?" I asked breathlessly. 

"Bella?" 

"Hey, Jess, I was just going to call you." 

"You made it home?" Her voice was relieved. . . and surprised. 

"Yes. I left my jacket in your car — could you bring it to me tomorrow?" 

"Sure. But tell me what happened!" she demanded. 

"Um, tomorrow — in Trig, okay?" 

She caught on quickly. "Oh, is your dad there?" 

"Yes, that's right." 

"Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow, then. Bye!" I could hear the impatience in her voice. 
"Bye, Jess." 

I walked up the stairs slowly, a heavy stupor clouding my mind. I went through the motions of getting 
ready for bed without paying any attention to what I was doing. It wasn't until I was in the shower — the 
water too hot, burning my skin — that I realized I was freezing. I shuddered violently for several minutes 
before the steaming spray could finally relax my rigid muscles. Then I stood in the shower, too tired to 
move, until the hot water began to run out. 

I stumbled out, wrapping myself securely in a towel, trying to hold the heat from the water in so the 
aching shivers wouldn't return. I dressed for bed swiftly and climbed under my quilt, curling into a ball, 
hugging myself to keep warm. A few small shudders trembled through me. 

My mind still swirled dizzily, full of images I couldn't understand, and some I fought to repress. Nothing 
seemed clear at first, but as I fell gradually closer to unconsciousness, a few certainties became evident. 

About three things I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was part of 
him — and I didn't know how potent that part might be — that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was 
unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him. 



10. INTERROGATIONS 



It was very hard, in the morning, to argue with the part of me that was sure last night was a dream. Logic 
wasn't on my side, or common sense. I clung to the parts I couldn't have imagined — like his smell. I was 
sure I could never have dreamed that up on my own. 

It was foggy and dark outside my window, absolutely perfect. He had no reason not to be in school 
today. I dressed in my heavy clothes, remembering I didn't have a jacket. Further proof that my memory 
was real. 

When I got downstairs, Charlie was gone again — I was running later than I'd realized. I swallowed a 
granola bar in three bites, chased it down with milk straight from the carton, and then hurried out the 
door. Hopefully the rain would hold off until I could find Jessica. 

It was unusually foggy; the air was almost smoky with it. The mist was ice cold where it clung to the 
exposed skin on my face and neck. I couldn't wait to get the heat going in my truck. It was such a thick 
fog that I was a few feet down the driveway before I realized there was a car in it: a silver car. My heart 
thudded, stuttered, and then picked up again in double time. 

I didn't see where he came from, but suddenly he was there, pulling the door open for me. 

"Do you want to ride with me today?" he asked, amused by my expression as he caught me by surprise 
yet again. There was uncertainty in his voice. He was really giving me a choice — I was free to refuse, 
and part of him hoped for that. It was a vain hope. 

"Yes, thank you," I said, trying to keep my voice calm. As I stepped into the warm car, I noticed his tan 
jacket was slung over the headrest of the passenger seat. The door closed behind me, and, sooner than 
should be possible, he was sitting next to me, starting the car. 

"I brought the jacket for you. I didn't want you to get sick or something." His voice was guarded. I 
noticed that he wore no jacket himself, just a light gray knit V-neck shirt with long sleeves. Again, the 
fabric clung to his perfectly muscled chest. It was a colossal tribute to his face that it kept my eyes away 
from his body. 

"I'm not quite that delicate," I said, but I pulled the jacket onto my lap, pushing my arms through the 
too-long sleeves, curious to see if the scent could possibly be as good as I remembered. It was better. 

"Aren't you?" he contradicted in a voice so low I wasn't sure if he meant for me to hear. 

We drove through the fog-shrouded streets, always too fast, feeling awkward. I was, at least. Last night 
all the walls were down. . . almost all. I didn't know if we were still being as candid today. It left me 
tongue-tied. I waited for him to speak. 

He turned to smirk at me. "What, no twenty questions today?" 

"Do my questions bother you?" I asked, relieved. 

"Not as much as your reactions do." He looked like he was joking, but I couldn't be sure. 
I frowned. "Do I react badly?" 

"No, that's the problem. You take everything so coolly — it's unnatural. It makes me wonder what you're 
really tliinking." 

"I always tell you what I'm really thinking." 



"You edit," he accused. 

"Not very much." 

"Enough to drive me insane." 

"You don't want to hear it," I mumbled, almost whispered. As soon as the words were out, I regretted 
them. The pain in my voice was very faint; I could only hope he hadn't noticed it. 

He didn't respond, and I wondered if I had ruined the mood. His face was unreadable as we drove into 
the school parking lot. Something occurred to me belatedly. 

"Where's the rest of your family?" I asked — more than glad to be alone with him, but remembering that 
his car was usually full. 

"They took Rosalie's car." He shrugged as he parked next to a glossy red convertible with the top up. 
"Ostentatious, isn't it?" 

"Urn, wow," I breathed. "If she has that, why does she ride with you?" 
"Like I said, it's ostentatious. We try to blend in." 

"You don't succeed." I laughed and shook my head as we got out of the car. I wasn't late anymore; his 
lunatic driving had gotten me to school in plenty of time. "So why did Rosalie drive today if it's more 
conspicuous?" 

"Hadn't you noticed? I'm breaking all the rules now." He met me at the front of the car, staying very 
close to my side as we walked onto campus. I wanted to close that little distance, to reach out and touch 
him, but I was afraid he wouldn't like me to. 

"Why do you have cars like that at all?" I wondered aloud. "If you're looking for privacy?" 
"An indulgence," he admitted with an impish smile. "We all like to drive fast." 
"Figures," I muttered under my breath. 

Under the shelter of the cafeteria roofs overhang, Jessica was waiting, her eyes about to bug out of their 
sockets. Over her arm, bless her, was my jacket. 

"Hey, Jessica," I said when we were a few feet away. "Thanks for remembering." She handed me my 
jacket without speaking. 

"Good morning, Jessica," Edward said politely. It wasn't really his fault that his voice was so irresistible. 
Or what his eyes were capable of. 

"Er. . . hi." She shifted her wide eyes to me, trying to gather her jumbled thoughts. "I guess I'll see you in 
Trig." She gave me a meaningful look, and I suppressed a sigh. What on earth was I going to tell her? 

"Yeah, I'll see you then." 

She walked away, pausing twice to peek back over her shoulder at us. 
"What are you going to tell her?" Edward murmured. 
"Hey, I thought you couldn't read my mind!" I hissed. 



"I can't," he said, startled. Then understanding brightened his eyes. "However, I can read hers — she'll be 
waiting to ambush you in class." 

I groaned as I pulled off his jacket and handed it to him, replacing it with my own. He folded it over his 
arm. 

"So what are you going to tell her?" 
"A little help?" I pleaded. "What does she want to know?" 
He shook his head, grinning wickedly. "That's not fair." 
"No, you not sharing what you know — now that's not fair." 

He deliberated for a moment as we walked. We stopped outside the door to my first class. 

"She wants to know if we're secretly dating. And she wants to know how you feel about me," he finally 
said. 

"Yikes. What should I say?" I tried to keep my expression very innocent. People were passing us on their 
way to class, probably staring, but I was barely aware of them. 

"Hmmm." He paused to catch a stray lock of hair that was escaping the twist on my neck and wound it 
back into place. My heart spluttered hyperactively. "I suppose you could say yes to the first. . . if you 
don't mind — it's easier than any other explanation." 

"I don't mind," I said in a faint voice. 

"And as for her other question. . . well, I'll be listening to hear the answer to that one myself." One side of 
his mouth pulled up into my favorite uneven smile. I couldn't catch my breath soon enough to respond to 
that remark. He turned and walked away. 

"I'll see you at lunch," he called over his shoulder. Three people walking in the door stopped to stare at 
me. 

I hurried into class, flushed and irritated. He was such a cheater. Now I was even more worried about 
what I was going to say to Jessica. I sat in my usual seat, slamming my bag down in aggravation. 

"Morning, Bella," Mike said from the seat next to me. I looked up to see an odd, almost resigned look on 
his face. "How was Port Angeles?" 

"It was. . . " There was no honest way to sum it up. "Great," I finished lamely. "Jessica got a really cute 
dress." 

"Did she say anything about Monday night?" he asked, his eyes brightening. I smiled at the turn the 
conversation had taken. 

"She said she had a really good time," I assured him. 
"She did?" he said eagerly. 
"Most definitely." 

Mr. Mason called the class to order then, asking us to turn in our papers. English and then Government 
passed in a blur, while I worried about how to explain things to Jessica and agonized over whether 



Edward would really be listening to what I said through the medium of Jess's thoughts. How very 
inconvenient his little talent could be — when it wasn't saving my life. 

The fog had almost dissolved by the end of the second hour, but the day was still dark with low, 
oppressing clouds. I smiled up at the sky. 

Edward was right, of course. When I walked into Trig Jessica was sitting in the back row, nearly 
bouncing off her seat in agitation. I reluctantly went to sit by her, trying to convince myself it would be 
better to get it over with as soon as possible. 

"Tell me everything!" she commanded before I was in the seat. 

"What do you want to know?" I hedged. 

"What happened last night?" 

"He bought me dinner, and then he drove me home." 

She glared at me, her expression stiff with skepticism. "How did you get home so fast?" 

"He drives like a maniac. It was terrifying." I hoped he heard that. 

"Was it like a date — did you tell him to meet you there?" 

I hadn't thought of that. "No — I was very surprised to see him there." 

Her lips puckered in disappointment at the transparent honesty in my voice. 

"But he picked you up for school today?" she probed. 

"Yes — that was a surprise, too. He noticed I didn't have a jacket last night," I explained. 
"So are you going out again?" 

"He offered to drive me to Seattle Saturday because he thinks toy truck isn't up to it — does that count?" 
"Yes." She nodded. 
"Well, then, yes." 

"W-o-w." She exaggerated the word into three syllables. "Edward Cullen." 
"I know," I agreed. "Wow" didn't even cover it. 

"Wait!" Her hands flew up, palms toward me like she was stopping traffic. "Has he kissed you?" 

"No," I mumbled. "It's not like that." 

She looked disappointed. I'm sure I did, too. 

"Do you think Saturday. . . ?" She raised her eyebrows. 

"I really doubt it." The discontent in my voice was poorly disguised. 

"What did you talk about?" She pushed for more information in a whisper. Class had started but Mr. 
Varner wasn't paying close attention and we weren't the only ones still talking. 



"I don't know, Jess, lots of stuff," I whispered back. "We talked about the English essay a little." A very, 
very little. I think he mentioned it in passing. 

"Please, Bella," she begged. "Give me some details." 

"Well. . . okay, I've got one. You should have seen the waitress flirting with him — it was over the top. 
But he didn't pay any attention to her at all." Let him make what he could of that. 

"That's a good sign," she nodded. "Was she pretty?" 

"Very — and probably nineteen or twenty." 

"Even better. He must like you." 

"I think so, but it's hard to tell. He's always so cryptic," I threw in for his benefit, sighing. 
"I don't know how you're brave enough to be alone with him," she breathed. 
"Why?" I was shocked, but she didn't understand my reaction. 

"He's so. . . intimidating. I wouldn't know what to say to him." She made a face, probably remembering 
this morning or last night, when he'd turned the overwhelming force of his eyes on her. 

"I do have some trouble with incoherency when I'm around him," I admitted. 

"Oh well. He is unbelievably gorgeous." Jessica shrugged as if this excused any flaws. Which, in her 
book, it probably did. 

"There's a lot more to him than that." 

"Really? Like what?" 

I wished I had let it go. Almost as much as I was hoping he'd been kidding about hstening in. 

"I can't explain it right. . . but he's even more unbelievable behind the face." The vampire who wanted to 
be good — who ran around saving people's lives so he wouldn't be a monster. . . I stared toward the 
front of the room. 

"Is that possible!" She giggled. 

I ignored her, trying to look like I was paying attention to Mr. Varner. 
"So you like him, then?" She wasn't about to give up. 
"Yes," I said curtly. 

"I mean, do you really like him?" she urged. 

"Yes," I said again, blushing. I hoped that detail wouldn't register in her thoughts. 

She'd had enough with the single syllable answers. "How much do you like him?" 

"Too much," I whispered back. "More than he likes me. But I don't see how I can help that." I sighed, 
one blush blending into the next. 

Then, thankfully, Mr. Varner called on Jessica for an answer. 



She didn't get a chance to start on the subject again during class, and as soon as the bell rang, I took 
evasive action. 

"In English, Mike asked me if you said anything about Monday night," I told her. 
"You're kidding! What did you say?!" she gasped, completely sidetracked. 
"I told him you said you had a lot of fun — he looked pleased." 
"Tell me exactly what he said, and your exact answer!" 

We spent the rest of the walk dissecting sentence structures and most of Spanish on a minute description 
of Mike's facial expressions. I wouldn't have helped draw it out for as long as I did if I wasn't worried 
about the subject returning to me. 

And then the bell rang for lunch. As I jumped up out of my seat, shoving my books roughly in my bag, 
my uplifted expression must have tipped Jessica off. 

"You're not sitting with us today, are you?" she guessed. 

"I don't think so." I couldn't be sure that he wouldn't disappear inconveniently again. 

But outside the door to our Spanish class, leaning against the wall — looking more like a Greek god than 
anyone had a right to — Edward was waiting for me. Jessica took one look, rolled her eyes, and 
departed. 

"See you later, Bella." Her voice was thick with implications. I might have to turn off the ringer on the 
phone. 

"Hello." His voice was amused and irritated at the same time. He had been listening, it was obvious. 
"Hi." 

I couldn't think of anything else to say, and he didn't speak — biding his time, I presumed — so it was a 
quiet walk to the cafeteria. Walking with Edward through the crowded lunchtime rush was a lot like my 
first day here; everyone stared. 

He led the way into the line, still not speaking, though his eyes returned to my face every few seconds, 
their expression speculative. It seemed to me that irritation was winning out over amusement as the 
dominant emotion in his face. I fidgeted nervously with the zipper on my jacket. 

He stepped up to the counter and filled a tray with food. 

"What are you doing?" I objected. "You're not getting all that for me?" 

He shook his head, stepping forward to buy the food. 

"Half is for me, of course." 

I raised one eyebrow. 

He led the way to the same place we'd sat that one time before. From the other end of the long table, a 
group of seniors gazed at us in amazement as we sat across from each other. Edward seemed oblivious. 

"Take whatever you want," he said, pushing the tray toward me. 



"I'm curious," I said as I picked up an apple, turning it around in my hands, "what would you do if 
someone dared you to eat food?" 

"You're always curious." He grimaced, shaking his head. He glared at me, holding my eyes as he lifted 
the slice of pizza off the tray, and deliberately bit off a mouthful, chewed quickly, and then swallowed. I 
watched, eyes wide. 

"If someone dared you to eat dirt, you could, couldn't you?" he asked condescendingly. 
I wrinkled my nose. "I did once. . . on a dare," I admitted. "It wasn't so bad." 

He laughed. "I suppose I'm not surprised." Something over my shoulder seemed to catch his attention. 

"Jessica's analyzing everything I do — she'll break it down for you later." He pushed the rest of the pizza 
toward me. The mention of Jessica brought a hint of his former irritation back to his features. 

I put down the apple and took a bite of the pizza, looking away, knowing he was about to start. 

"So the waitress was pretty, was she?" he asked casually. 

"You really didn't notice?" 

"No. I wasn't paying attention. I had a lot on my mind." 
"Poor girl." I could afford to be generous now. 

"Something you said to Jessica. . . well, it bothers me." He refused to be distracted. His voice was husky, 
and he glanced up from under his lashes with troubled eyes. 

"I'm not surprised you heard something you didn't like. You know what they say about eavesdropners," I 
reminded him. 

"I warned you I would be Ustening." 

"And I warned you that you didn't want to know everything I was thinking." 

"You did," he agreed, but his voice was still rough. "You aren't precisely right, though. I do want to know 
what you're minking — everything. I just wish. . . that you wouldn't be tliinking some things." 

I scowled. "That's quite a distinction." 

"But that's not really the point at the moment." 

"Then what is?" We were inclined toward each other across the table now. He had his large white hands 
folded under his chin; I leaned forward, my right hand cupped around my neck. I had to remind myself 
that we were in a crowded lunchroom, with probably many curious eyes on us. It was too easy to get 
wrapped up in our own private, tense little bubble. 

"Do you truly believe that you care more for me than I do for you?" he murmured, leaning closer to me as 
he spoke, his dark golden eyes piercing. 

I tried to remember how to exhale. I had to look away before it came back to me. 

"You're doing it again," I muttered. 

His eyes opened wide with surprise. "What?" 



"Dazzling me," I admitted, trying to concentrate as I looked back at him. 
"Oh." He frowned. 

"It's not your fault," I sighed. "You can't help it." 
"Are you going to answer the question?" 
I looked down. "Yes." 

"Yes, you are going to answer, or yes, you really think that?" He was irritated again. 

"Yes, I really think that." I kept my eyes down on the table, my eyes tracing the pattern of the faux wood 
grains printed on the laminate. The silence dragged on. I stubbornly refused to be the first to break it this 
time, fighting hard against the temptation to peek at his expression. 

Finally he spoke, voice velvet soft. "You're wrong." 

I glanced up to see that his eyes were gentle. 

"You can't know that," I disagreed in a whisper. I shook my head in doubt, though my heart throbbed at 
his words and I wanted so badly to believe them. 

"What makes you think so?" His liquid topaz eyes were penetrating — trying futilely, I assumed, to lift the 
truth straight from my mind. 

I stared back, struggling to think clearly in spite of his face, to find some way to explain. As I searched 
for the words, I could see him getting impatient; frustrated by my silence, he started to scowl. I lifted my 
hand from my neck, and held up one finger. 

"Let me think," I insisted. His expression cleared, now that he was satisfied that I was planning to answer. 
I dropped my hand to the table, moving my left hand so that my palms were pressed together. I stared at 
my hands, twisting and untwisting my fingers, as I finally spoke. 

"Well, aside from the obvious, sometimes. . . " I hesitated. "I can't be sure — / don't know how to read 
minds — but sometimes it seems like you're trying to say goodbye when you're saying something else." 
That was the best I could sum up the sensation of anguish that his words triggered in me at times. 

"Perceptive," he whispered. And there was the anguish again, surfacing as he confirmed my fear. "That's 
exactiy why you're wrong, though," he began to explain, but then his eyes narrowed. "What do you 
mean, 'the obvious'?" 

"Well, look at me," I said, unnecessarily as he was already staring. "I'm absolutely ordinary — well, 
except for bad things like all the near-death experiences and being so clumsy that I'm almost disabled. 
And look at you." I waved my hand toward him and all his bewildering perfection. 

His brow creased angrily for a moment, then smoothed as his eyes took on a knowing look. "You don't 
see yourself very clearly, you know. I'll admit you're dead-on about the bad things," he chuckled blackly, 
"but you didn't hear what every human male in this school was tWnking on your first day." 

I blinked, astonished. "I don't believe it. . . " I mumbled to myself. 

"Trust me just this once — you are the opposite of ordinary." 

My embarrassment was much stronger than my pleasure at the look that came into his eyes when he said 



this. I quickly reminded him of my original argument. 
"But I'm not saying goodbye," I pointed out. 

"Don't you see? That's what proves me right. I care the most, because if I can do it" — he shook his 
head, seeming to struggle with the thought — "if leaving is the right thing to do, then I'll hurt myself to 
keep from hurting you, to keep you safe." 

I glared. "And you don't think I would do the same?" 

"You'd never have to make the choice." 

Abruptly, his unpredictable mood shifted again; a mischievous, devastating smile rearranged his features. 
"Of course, keeping you safe is beginning to feel like a full-time occupation that requires my constant 
presence." 

"No one has tried to do away with me today," I reminded him, grateful for the lighter subject. I didn't 
want him to talk about goodbyes anymore. If I had to, I supposed I could purposefully put myself in 
danger to keep him close. . . I banished that thought before his quick eyes read it on my face. That idea 
would definitely get me in trouble. 

"Yet," he added. 

"Yet," I agreed; I would have argued, but now I wanted him to be expecting disasters. 

"I have another question for you." His face was still casual. 

"Shoot." 

"Do you really need to go to Seattle this Saturday, or was that just an excuse to get out of saying no to 
all your admirers?" 

I made a face at the memory. "You know, I haven't forgiven you for the Tyler thing yet," I warned him. 
"It's your fault that he's deluded himself into tMnking I'm going to prom with him." 

"Oh, he would have found a chance to ask you without me — I just really wanted to watch your face," 
he chuckled, I would have been angrier if his laughter wasn't so fascinating. "If I'd asked you, would you 
have turned me down?" he asked, still laughing to himself. 

"Probably not," I admitted. "But I would have canceled later — faked an illness or a sprained ankle." 
He was puzzled. "Why would you do that?" 

I shook my head sadly. "You've never seen me in Gym, I guess, but I would have thought you would 
understand." 

"Are you referring to the fact that you can't walk across a flat, stable surface without finding something to 
trip over?" 

"Obviously." 

"That wouldn't be a problem." He was very confident. "It's all in the leading." He could see that I was 
about to protest, and he cut me off. "But you never told me — are you resolved on going to Seattle, or 
do you mind if we do something different?" 



As long as the "we" part was in, I didn't care about anything else. 

"I'm open to alternatives," I allowed. "But I do have a favor to ask." 

He looked wary, as he always did when I asked an open-ended question. "What?" 

"Can I drive?" 

He frowned. "Why?" 

"Well, mostly because when I told Charlie I was going to Seattle, he specifically asked if I was going 
alone and, at the time, I was. If he asked again, I probably wouldn't lie, but I don't think he will ask 
again, and leaving my truck at home would just bring up the subject unnecessarily. And also, because 
your driving frightens me." 

He rolled his eyes. "Of all the things about me that could frighten you, you worry about my driving." He 
shook his head in disgust, but then his eyes were serious again. "Won't you want to tell your father that 
you're spending the day with me?" There was an undercurrent to his question that I didn't understand. 

"With Charlie, less is always more." I was definite about that. "Where are we going, anyway?" 

"The weather will be nice, so I'll be staying out of the public eye. . . and you can stay with me, if you'd like 
to." Again, he was leaving the choice up to me. 

"And you'll show me what you meant, about the sun?" I asked, excited by the idea of unraveling another 
of the unknowns. 

"Yes." He smiled, and then paused. "But if you don't want to be. . . alone with me, I'd still rather you 
didn't go to Seattle by yourself. I shudder to think of the trouble you could find in a city that size." 

I was miffed. "Phoenix is three times bigger than Seattle — just in population. In physical size — " 

"But apparently," he interrupted me, "your number wasn't up in Phoenix. So I'd rather you stayed near 
me." His eyes did that unfair smoldering thing again. 

I couldn't argue, with the eyes or the motivation, and it was a moot point anyway. "As it happens, I don't 
mind being alone with you." 

"I know," he sighed, brooding. "You should tell Charlie, though." 
"Why in the world would I do that?" 

His eyes were suddenly fierce. "To give me some small incentive to bring you back." 

I gulped. But, after a moment of thought, I was sure. "I think I'll take my chances." 

He exhaled angrily, and looked away. 

"Let's talk about something else," I suggested. 

"What do you want to talk about?" he asked. He was still annoyed. 

I glanced around us, making sure we were well out of anyone's hearing. As I cast my eyes around the 
room, I caught the eyes of his sister, Alice, staring at me. The others were looking at Edward. I looked 
away swiftly, back to him, and I. asked the first thing that came to mind. 



"Why did you go to that Goat Rocks place last weekend. . . to hunt? Charlie said it wasn't a good place 
to hike, because of bears." 

He stared at me as if I was missing something very obvious. 

"Bears?" I gasped, and he smirked. "You know, bears are not in season," I added sternly, to hide my 
shock. 

"If you read carefully, the laws only cover hunting with weapons," he informed me. 
He watched my face with enjoyment as that slowly sank in. 
"Bears?" I repeated with difficulty. 

"Grizzly is Emmett's favorite." His voice was still offhand, but his eyes were scrutinizing my reaction. I 
tried to pull myself together. 

"Hrnmm," I said, taking another bite of pizza as an excuse to look down. I chewed slowly, and then took 
a long drink of Coke without looking up. 

"So," I said after a moment, finally meeting his now-anxious gaze. "What's your favorite?" 

He raised an eyebrow and the corners of his mouth turned down in disapproval. "Mountain lion." 

"Ah," I said in a politely disinterested tone, looking for my soda again. 

"Of course," he said, and his tone mirrored mine, "we have to be careful not to impact the environment 
with injudicious hunting. We try to focus on areas with an overpopulation of predators — ranging as far 
away as we need. There's always plenty of deer and elk here, and they'll do, but where's the fun in that?" 
He smiled teasingly. 

"Where indeed," I murmured around another bite of pizza. 

"Early spring is Emmett's favorite bear season — they're just coining out of hibernation, so they're more 
irritable." He smiled at some remembered joke. 

"Nothing more fun than an irritated grizzly bear," I agreed, nodding. 

He snickered, shaking his head. "Tell me what you're really minking, please." 

"I'm trying to picture it — but I can't," I admitted. "How do you hunt a bear without weapons?" 

"Oh, we have weapons." He flashed his bright teeth in a brief, threatening smile. I fought back a shiver 
before it could expose me. "Just not the kind they consider when writing hunting laws. If you've ever seen 
a bear attack on television, you should be able to visualize Emmett hunting." 

I couldn't stop the next shiver that flashed down my spine. I peeked across the cafeteria toward Emmett, 
grateful that he wasn't looking my way. The thick bands of muscle that wrapped his arms and torso were 
somehow even more menacing now. 

Edward followed my gaze and chuckled. I stared at him, unnerved. 
"Are you like a bear, too?" I asked in a low voice. 

"More like the lion, or so they tell me," he said lightiy. "Perhaps our preferences are indicative." 



I tried to smile. "Perhaps," I repeated. But my mind was filled with opposing images that I couldn't merge 
together. "Is that something I might get to see?" 

"Absolutely not!" His face turned even whiter than usual, and his eyes were suddenly furious. I leaned 
back, stunned and — though I'd never admit it to him — frightened by his reaction. He leaned back as 
well, folding his arms across his chest. 

"Too scary for me?" I asked when I could control my voice again. 

"If that were it, I would take you out tonight," he said, his voice cutting. "You need a healthy dose of fear. 
Nothing could be more beneficial for you." 

"Then why?" I pressed, trying to ignore his angry expression. 

He glared at me for a long minute. 

"Later," he finally said. He was on his feet in one lithe movement. "We're going to be late." 

I glanced around, startled to see that he was right and the cafeteria was nearly vacant. When I was with 
him, the time and the place were such a muddled blur that I completely lost track of both. I jumped up, 
grabbing my bag from the back of my chair. 

"Later, then," I agreed. I wouldn't forget. 
11. COMPLICATIONS 



Everyone watched us as we walked together to our lab table. I noticed that he no longer angled the chair 
to sit as far from me as the desk would allow. Instead, he sat quite close beside me, our arms almost 
touching. 

Mr. Banner backed into the room then — what superb timing the man had — pulling a tall metal frame 
on wheels that held a heavy-looking, outdated TV and VCR. A movie day — the lift in the class 
atmosphere was almost tangible. 

Mr. Banner shoved the tape into the reluctant VCR and walked to the wall to turn off the lights. 

And then, as the room went black, I was suddenly hyperaware that Edward was sitting less than an inch 
from me. I was stunned by the unexpected electricity that flowed through me, amazed that it was possible 
to be more aware of him than I already was. A crazy impulse to reach over and touch him, to stroke his 
perfect face just once in the darkness, nearly overwhelmed me. I crossed my arms tightiy across my 
chest, my hands balling into fists. I was losing my mind. 

The opening credits began, lighting the room by a token amount. My eyes, of their own accord, flickered 
to him. I smiled sheepishly as I realized his posture was identical to mine, fists clenched under his arms, 
right down to the eyes, peering sideways at me. He grinned back, his eyes somehow managing to 
smolder, even in the dark. I looked away before I could start hyperventilating. It was absolutely 
ridiculous that I should feel dizzy. 

The hour seemed very long. I couldn't concentrate on the movie — I didn't even know what subject it 
was on. I tried unsuccessfully to relax, but the electric current that seemed to be originating from 
somewhere in his body never slackened. Occasionally I would permit myself a quick glance in his 



direction, but he never seemed to relax, either. The overpowering craving to touch him also refused to 
fade, and I crushed my fists safely against my ribs until my fingers were aching with the effort. 

I breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Banner flicked the lights back on at the end of class, and stretched 
my arms out in front of me, flexing my stiff fingers. Edward chuckled beside me. 

"Well, that was interesting," he murmured. His voice was dark and his eyes were cautious. 

"Umm," was all I was able to respond. 

"Shall we?" he asked, rising fluidly. 

I almost groaned. Time for Gym. I stood with care, worried my balance might have been affected by the 
strange new intensity between us. 

He walked me to my next class in silence and paused at the door; I turned to say goodbye. His face 
startled me — his expression was torn, almost pained, and so fiercely beautiful that the ache to touch him 
flared as strong as before. My goodbye stuck in my throat. 

He raised his hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his eyes, and then swiftly brushed the length of my 
cheekbone with his fingertips. His skin was as icy as ever, but the trail his fingers left on my skin was 
alarmingly warm — like I'd been burned, but didn't feel the pain of it yet. 

He turned without a word and strode quickly away from me. 

I walked into the gym, lightheaded and wobbly. I drifted to the locker room, changing in a trancelike 
state, only vaguely aware that there were other people surrounding me. Reality didn't fully set in until I 
was handed a racket. It wasn't heavy, yet it felt very unsafe in my hand. I could see a few of the other 
kids in class eyeing me furtively. Coach Clapp ordered us to pair up into teams. 

Mercifully, some vestiges of Mike's chivalry still survived; he came to stand beside me. 

"Do you want to be a team?" 

"Thanks, Mike — you don't have to do this, you know." I grimaced apologetically. 

"Don't worry, I'll keep out of your way." He grinned. Sometimes it was so easy to like Mike. 

It didn't go smoothly. I somehow managed to hit myself in the head with my racket and clip Mike's 
shoulder on the same swing. I spent the rest of the hour in the back comer of the court, the racket held 
safely behind my back. Despite being handicapped by me, Mike was pretty good; he won three games 
out of four singlehandedly. He gave me an unearned high five when the coach finally blew the whistle 
ending class. 

"So," he said as we walked off the court. 
"So what?" 

"You and Cullen, huh?" he asked, his tone rebellious. My previous feeling of affection disappeared. 

"That's none of your business, Mike," I warned, internally cursing Jessica straight to the fiery pits of 
Hades. 

"I don't like it," he muttered anyway. 



"You don't have to," I snapped. 

"He looks at you like. . . like you're something to eat," he continued, ignoring me. 

I choked back the hysteria that threatened to explode, but a small giggle managed to get out despite my 
efforts. He glowered at me. I waved and fled to the locker room. 

I dressed quickly, something stronger than butterflies battering recklessly against the walls of my stomach, 
my argument with Mike already a distant memory. I was wondering if Edward would be waiting, or if I 
should meet him at his car. What if his family was there? I felt a wave of real terror. Did they know that I 
knew? Was I supposed to know that they knew that I knew, or not? 

By the time I walked out of the gym, I had just about decided to walk straight home without even looking 
toward the parking lot. But my worries were unnecessary. Edward was waiting, leaning casually against 
the side of the gym, his breathtaking face untroubled now. As I walked to his side, I felt a peculiar sense 
of release. 

"Hi," I breathed, smiling hugely. 

"Hello." His answering smile was brilliant. "How was Gym?" 
My face fell a tiny bit. "Fine," I lied. 

"Really?" He was unconvinced. His eyes shifted their focus slightiy, looking over my shoulder and 
narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike's back as he walked away. 

"What?" I demanded. 

His eyes slid back to mine, still tight. "Newton's getting on my nerves." 

"You weren't listening again?" I was horror-struck. All traces of my sudden good humor vanished. 
"How's your head?" he asked innocently. 

"You're unbelievable!" I turned, stomping away in the general direction of the parking lot, though I hadn't 
ruled out walking at this point. 

He kept up with me easily. 

"You were the one who mentioned how I'd never seen you in Gym — it made me curious." He didn't 
sound repentant, so I ignored him. 

We walked in silence — a furious, embarrassed silence on my part — to his car. But I had to stop a few 
steps away — a crowd of people, all boys, were surrounding it. 

Then I realized they weren't surrounding the Volvo, they were actually circled around Rosalie's red 
convertible, unmistakable lust in their eyes. None of them even looked up as Edward slid between them 
to open his door. I climbed quickly in the passenger side, also unnoticed. 

"Ostentatious," he muttered. 

"What kind of car is that?" I asked. 



"AnM3." 



"I don't speak Car and Driver" 

"It's a BMW." He rolled his eyes, not looking at me, trying to back out without running over the car 
enthusiasts. 

I nodded — I'd heard of that one. 

"Are you still angry?" he asked as he carefully maneuvered his way out. 
"Definitely." 

He sighed. "Will you forgive me if I apologize?" 

"Maybe. . . if you mean it. And if you promise not to do it again," I insisted. 

His eyes were suddenly shrewd. "How about if I mean it, and I agree to let you drive Saturday?" he 
countered my conditions. 

I considered, and decided it was probably the best offer I would get. "Deal," I agreed. 

"Then I'm very sorry I upset you." His eyes burned with sincerity for a protracted moment — playing 
havoc with the rhythm of my heart — and then turned playful. "And I'll be on your doorstep bright and 
early Saturday morning." 

"Um, it doesn't help with the Charlie situation if an unexplained Volvo is left in the driveway." 

His smile was condescending now. "I wasn't intending to bring a car." 

"How—" 

He cut me off. "Don't worry about it. I'll be there, no car." 
I let it go. I had a more pressing question. 
"Is it later yet?" I asked significantiy. 
He frowned. "I supposed it is later." 
I kept my expression polite as I waited. 

He stopped the car. I looked up, surprised — of course we were already at Charlie's house, parked 
behind the truck. It was easier to ride with him if I only looked when it was over. When I looked back at 
him, he was staring at me, measuring with his eyes. 

"And you still want to know why you can't see me hunt?" He seemed solemn, but I thought I saw a trace 
of humor deep in his eyes. 

"Well," I clarified, "I was mostly wondering about your reaction." 
"Did I frighten you?" Yes, there was definitely humor there. 
"No," I lied. He didn't buy it. 

"I apologize for scaring you," he persisted with a slight smile, but then all evidence of teasing disappeared. 
"It was just the very thought of you being there. . . while we hunted." His jaw tightened. 



"That would be bad?" 



He spoke from between clenched teeth. "Extremely." 
"Because... ?" 

He took a deep breath and stared through the windshield at the thick, rolling clouds that seemed to press 
down, almost within reach. 

"When we hunt," he spoke slowly, unwillingly, "we give ourselves over to our senses. . . govern less with 
our minds. Especially our sense of smell. If you were anywhere near me when I lost control that way ..." 
He shook his head, still gazing morosely at the heavy clouds. 

I kept my expression firmly under control, expecting the swift flash of his eyes to judge my reaction that 
soon followed. My face gave nothing away. 

But our eyes held, and the silence deepened — and changed. Flickers of the electricity I'd felt this 
afternoon began to charge the atmosphere as he gazed unrelentingly into my eyes. It wasn't until my head 
started to swim that I realized I wasn't breathing. When I drew in a jagged breath, breaking the stillness, 
he closed his eyes. 

"Bella, I think you should go inside now." His low voice was rough, his eyes on the clouds again. 

I opened the door, and the arctic draft that burst into the car helped clear my head. Afraid I might 
stumble in my woozy state, I stepped carefully out of the car and shut the door behind me without 
looking back. The whir of the automatic window unrolling made me turn. 

"Oh, Bella?" he called after me, his voice more even. He leaned toward the open window with a faint 
smile on his lips. 

"Yes?" 

"Tomorrow it's my turn." 
"Your turn to what?" 

He smiled wider, flashing his gleaming teeth. "Ask the questions." 

And then he was gone, the car speeding down the street and disappearing around the comer before I 
could even collect my thoughts. I smiled as I walked to the house. It was clear he was planning to see me 
tomorrow, if nothing else. 

That night Edward starred in my dreams, as usual. However, the climate of my unconsciousness had 
changed. It thrilled with the same electricity that had charged the afternoon, and I tossed and turned 
restlessly, waking often. It was only in the early hours of the morning that I finally sank into an exhausted, 
dreamless sleep. 

When I woke I was still tired, but edgy as well. I pulled on my brown turtleneck and the inescapable 
jeans, sighing as I daydreamed of spaghetti straps and shorts. Breakfast was the usual, quiet event I 
expected. Charlie fried eggs for himself; I had my bowl of cereal. I wondered if he had forgotten about 
this Saturday. He answered my unspoken question as he stood up to take his plate to the sink. 

"About this Saturday. . ." he began, walking across the kitchen and turning on the faucet. 



I cringed. "Yes, Dad?" 



"Are you still set on going to Seattle?" he asked. 

"That was the plan." I grimaced, wishing he hadn't brought it up so I wouldn't have to compose careful 
half-truths. 

He squeezed some dish soap onto his plate and swirled it around with the brush. "And you're sure you 
can't make it back in time for the dance?" 

"I'm not going to the dance, Dad." I glared. 

"Didn't anyone ask you?" he asked, trying to hide his concern by focusing on rinsing the plate. 
I sidestepped the minefield. "It's a girl's choice." 
"Oh." He frowned as he dried his plate. 

I sympathized with him. It must be a hard thing, to be a father; living in fear that your daughter would 
meet a boy she liked, but also having to worry if she didn't. How ghastly it would be, I thought, 
shuddering, if Charlie had even the slightest inkling of exactiy what I did like. 

Charlie left then, with a goodbye wave, and I went upstairs to brush my teeth and gather my books. 
When I heard the cruiser pull away, I could only wait a few seconds before I had to peek out of my 
window. The silver car was already there, waiting in Charlie's spot on the driveway. I bounded down the 
stairs and out the front door, wondering how long this bizarre routine would continue. I never wanted it to 
end. 

He waited in the car, not appearing to watch as I shut the door behind me without bothering to lock the 
dead-bolt. I walked to the car, pausing shyly before opening the door and stepping in. He was smiling, 
relaxed — and, as usual, perfect and beautiful to an excruciating degree. 

"Good morning." His voice was silky. "How are you today?" His eyes roamed over my face, as if his 
question was something more than simple courtesy. 

"Good, thank you." I was always good — much more than good — when I was near him. 
His gaze lingered on the circles under my eyes. "You look tired." 

"I couldn't sleep," I confessed, automatically swinging my hair around my shoulder to provide some 
measure of cover. 

"Neither could I," he teased as he started the engine. I was becoming used to the quiet purr. I was sure 
the roar of my truck would scare me, whenever I got to drive it again. 

I laughed. "I guess that's right. I suppose I slept just a little bit more than you did." 

"I'd wager you did." 

"So what did you do last night?" I asked. 

He chuckled. "Not a chance. It's my day to ask questions." 

"Oh, that's right. What do you want to know?" My forehead creased. I couldn't imagine anything about 
me that could be in any way interesting to him. 

"What's your favorite color?" he asked, his face grave. 



I rolled my eyes. "It changes from day to day." 

"What's your favorite color today?" He was still solemn. 

"Probably brown." I tended to dress according to my mood. 

He snorted, dropping his serious expression. "Brown?" he asked skeptically. 

"Sure. Brown is warm. I miss brown. Everything that's supposed to be brown — tree trunks, rocks, dirt 
— is all covered up with squashy green stuff here," I complained. 

He seemed fascinated by my little rant. He considered for a moment, staring into my eyes. 

"You're right," he decided, serious again. "Brown is warm." He reached over, swiftly, but somehow still 
hesitantly, to sweep my hair back behind my shoulder. 

We were at the school by now. He turned back to me as he pulled into a parking space. 

"What music is in your CD player right now?" he asked, his face as somber as if he'd asked for a murder 
confession. 

I realized I'd never removed the CD Phil had given me. When I said the name of the band, he smiled 
crookedly, a peculiar expression in his eyes. He flipped open a compartment under his car's CD player, 
pulled out one of thirty or so CDs that were jammed into the small space, and handed it to me, 

"Debussy to this?" He raised an eyebrow. 

It was the same CD. I examined the familiar cover art, keeping my eyes down. 

It continued like that for the rest of the day. While he walked me to English, when he met me after 
Spanish, all through the lunch hour, he questioned me relentlessly about every insignificant detail of my 
existence. Movies I'd liked and hated, the few places I'd been and the many places I wanted to go, and 
books — endlessly books. 

I couldn't remember the last time I'd talked so much. More often than not, I felt self-conscious, certain I 
must be boring him. But the absolute absorption of his face, and his never-ending stream of questions, 
compelled me to continue. Mostly his questions were easy, only a very few triggering my easy blushes. 
But when I did flush, it brought on a whole new round of questions. 

Such as the time he asked my favorite gemstone, and I blurted out topaz before thinking. He'd been 
flinging questions at me with such speed that I felt like I was taking one of those psychiatric tests where 
you answer with the first word that comes to mind. I was sure he would have continued down whatever 
mental list he was following, except for the blush. My face reddened because, until very recently, my 
favorite gemstone was garnet. It was impossible, while staring back into his topaz eyes, not to remember 
the reason for the switch. And, naturally, he wouldn't rest until I'd admitted why I was embarrassed. 

"Tell me," he finally commanded after persuasion failed — failed only because I kept my eyes safely 
away from his face. 

"It's the color of your eyes today," I sighed, surrendering, staring down at my hands as I fiddled with a 
piece of my hair. "I suppose if you asked me in two weeks I'd say onyx." I'd given more information than 
necessary in my unwilling honesty, and I worried it would provoke the strange anger that flared whenever 
I slipped and revealed too clearly how obsessed I was. 



But his pause was very short. 

"What kinds of flowers do you prefer?" he fired off. 

I sighed in relief, and continued with the psychoanalysis. 

Biology was a complication again. Edward had continued with his quizzing up until Mr. Banner entered 
the room, dragging the audiovisual frame again. As the teacher approached the light switch, I noticed 
Edward slide his chair slightly farther away from mine. It didn't help. As soon as the room was dark, 
there was the same electric spark, the same restless craving to stretch my hand across the short space 
and touch his cold skin, as yesterday. 

I leaned forward on the table, resting my chin on my folded arms, my hidden fingers gripping the table's 
edge as I fought to ignore the irrational longing that unsettled me. I didn't look at him, afraid that if he was 
looking at me, it would only make self-control that much harder. I sincerely tried to watch the movie, but 
at the end of the hour I had no idea what I'd just seen. I sighed in relief again when Mr. Banner turned the 
lights on, finally glancing at Edward; he was looking at me, his eyes ambivalent. 

He rose in silence and then stood still, waiting for me. We walked toward the gym in silence, like 
yesterday. And, also like yesterday, he touched my face wordlessly — this time with the back of his cool 
hand, stroking once from my temple to my jaw — before he turned and walked away. 

Gym passed quickly as I watched Mike's one-man badminton show. He didn't speak to me today, either 
in response to my vacant expression or because he was still angry about our squabble yesterday. 
Somewhere, in a corner of my mind, I felt bad about that. But I couldn't concentrate on him. 

I hurried to change afterward, ill at ease, knowing the faster I moved, the sooner I would be with 
Edward. The pressure made me more clumsy than usual, but eventually I made it out the door, feeling the 
same release when I saw him standing there, a wide smile automatically spreading across my face. He 
smiled in reaction before launching into more cross-examination. 

His questions were different now, though, not as easily answered. He wanted to know what I missed 
about home, insisting on descriptions of anything he wasn't familiar with. We sat in front of Charlie's 
house for hours, as the sky darkened and rain plummeted around us in a sudden deluge. 

I tried to describe impossible things like the scent of creosote — bitter, slightly resinous, but still pleasant 
— the high, keening sound of the cicadas in July, the feathery barrenness of the trees, the very size of the 
sky, extending white-blue from horizon to horizon, barely interrupted by the low mountains covered with 
purple volcanic rock. The hardest thing to explain was why it was so beautiful to me — to justify a 
beauty that didn't depend on the sparse, spiny vegetation that often looked half dead, a beauty that had 
more to do with the exposed shape of the land, with the shallow bowls of valleys between the craggy 
hills, and the way they held on to the sun. I found myself using my hands as I tried to describe it to him. 

His quiet, probing questions kept me talking freely, forgetting, in the dim light of the storm, to be 
embarrassed for monopolizing the conversation. Finally, when I had finished detailing my cluttered room 
at home, he paused instead of responding with another question. 

"Are you finished?" I asked in relief. 

"Not even close — but your father will be home soon." 

"Charlie!" I suddenly recalled his existence, and sighed. I looked out at the rain-darkened sky, but it gave 
nothing away. "How late is it?" I wondered out loud as I glanced at the clock. I was surprised by the time 



— Charlie would be driving home now. 

"It's twilight," Edward murmured, looking at the western horizon, obscured as it was with clouds. His 
voice was thoughtful, as if his mind were somewhere far away. I stared at him as he gazed unseeingly out 
the windshield. 

I was still staring when his eyes suddenly shifted back to mine. 

"It's the safest time of day for us," he said, answering the unspoken question in my eyes. "The easiest 
time. But also the saddest, in a way. . . the end of another day, the return of the night. Darkness is so 
predictable, don't you think?" He smiled wistfully. 

"I like the night. Without the dark, we'd never see the stars." I frowned. "Not that you see them here 
much." 

He laughed, and the mood abruptiy lightened. 

"Charlie will be here in a few minutes. So, unless you want to tell him that you'll be with me Saturday. . . " 
He raised one eyebrow. 

"Thanks, but no thanks." I gathered my books, realizing I was stiff from sitting still so long. "So is it my 
turn tomorrow, then?" 

"Certainly not!" His face was teasingly outraged. "I told you I wasn't done, didn't I?" 
"What more is there?" 

"You'll find out tomorrow." He reached across to open my door for me, and his sudden proximity sent 
my heart into frenzied palpitations. 

But his hand froze on the handle. 

"Not good," he muttered. 

"What is it?" I was surprised to see that his jaw was clenched, his eyes disturbed. 
He glanced at me for a brief second. "Another complication," he said glumly. 

He flung the door open in one swift movement, and then moved, almost cringed, swiftly away from me. 

The flash of headlights through the rain caught my attention as a dark car pulled up to the curb just a few 
feet away, facing us. 

"Charlie's around the comer," he warned, staring through the downpour at the other vehicle. 

I hopped out at once, despite my confusion and curiosity. The rain was louder as it glanced off my 
jacket. 

I tried to make out the shapes in the front seat of the other car, but it was too dark. I could see Edward 
illuminated in the glare of the new car's headlights; he was still staring ahead, his gaze locked on 
something or someone I couldn't see. His expression was a strange mix of frustration and defiance. 

Then he revved the engine, and the tires squealed against the wet pavement. The Volvo was out of sight 
in seconds. 



"Hey, Bella," called a familiar, husky voice from the driver's side of the lMe black car. 

"Jacob?" I asked, squinting through the rain. Just then, Charlie's cruiser swung around the corner, his 
lights shining on the occupants of the car in front of me. 

Jacob was already climbing out, his wide grin visible even through the darkness. In the passenger seat 
was a much older man, a heavyset man with a memorable face — a face that overflowed, the cheeks 
resting against his shoulders, with creases running through the russet skin like an old leather jacket. And 
the surprisingly familiar eyes, black eyes that seemed at the same time both too young and too ancient for 
the broad face they were set in. Jacob's father, Billy Black. I knew him immediately, though in the more 
than five years since I'd seen him last I'd managed to forget his name when Charlie had spoken of him my 
first day here. He was staring at me, scrutinizing my face, so I smiled tentatively at him. His eyes were 
wide, as if in shock or fear, his nostrils flared. My smile faded. 

Another complication, Edward had said. 

Billy still stared at me with intense, anxious eyes. I groaned internally. Had Billy recognized Edward so 
easily? Could he really believe the impossible legends his son had scoffed at? 

The answer was clear in Billy's eyes. Yes. Yes, he could. 
12. BALANCING 

"Billy!" Charlie called as soon as he got out of the car. 

I turned toward the house, beckoning to Jacob as I ducked under the porch. I heard Charlie greeting 
them loudly behind me. 

"I'm going to pretend I didn't see you behind the wheel, Jake," he said disapprovingly. 

"We get permits early on the rez," Jacob said while I unlocked the door and flicked on the porch light. 

"Sure you do," Charlie laughed. 

"I have to get around somehow." I recognized Billy's resonant voice easily, despite the years. The sound 
of it made me feel suddenly younger, a child. 

I went inside, leaving the door open behind me and turning on lights before I hung up my jacket. Then I 
stood in the door, watching anxiously as Charlie and Jacob helped Billy out of the car and into his 
wheelchair. 

I backed out of the way as the three of them hurried in, shaking off the rain. 
"This is a surprise," Charlie was saying. 

"It's been too long," Billy answered. "I hope it's not a bad time." His dark eyes flashed up to me again, 
their expression unreadable. 

"No, it's great. I hope you can stay for the game." 

Jacob grinned. "I think that's the plan — our TV broke last week." 



Billy made a face at his son. "And, of course, Jacob was anxious to see Bella again," he added. Jacob 
scowled and ducked his head while I fought back a surge of remorse. Maybe I'd been too convincing on 
the beach. 

"Are you hungry?" I asked, turning toward the kitchen. I was eager to escape Billy's searching gaze. 
"Naw, we ate just before we came," Jacob answered. 

"How about you, Charlie?" I called over my shoulder as I fled around the comer. 

"Sure," he replied, his voice moving in the direction of the front room and the TV. I could hear Billy's 
chair follow. 

The grilled cheese sandwiches were in the frying pan and I was slicing up a tomato when I sensed 
someone behind me. 

"So, how are things?" Jacob asked. 

"Pretty good." I smiled. His enthusiasm was hard to resist. "How about you? Did you finish your car?" 

"No." He frowned. "I still need parts. We borrowed that one." He pointed with his thumb in the direction 
of the front yard. 

"Sorry. I haven't seen any. . . what was it you were looking for?" 

"Master cylinder." He grinned. "Is something wrong with the truck?" he added suddenly. 

"No." 

"Oh. I just wondered because you weren't driving it." 

I stared down at the pan, pulling up the edge of a sandwich to check the bottom side. "I got a ride with a 
friend." 

"Nice ride." Jacob's voice was admiring. "I didn't recognize the driver, though. I thought I knew most of 
the kids around here." 

I nodded noncommittally, keeping my eyes down as I flipped sandwiches. 
"My dad seemed to know him from somewhere." 

"Jacob, could you hand me some plates? They're in the cupboard over the sink." 
"Sure." 

He got the plates in silence. I hoped he would let it drop now. 

"So who was it?" he asked, setting two plates on the counter next to me. 

I sighed in defeat. "Edward Cullen." 

To my surprise, he laughed. I glanced up at him. He looked a little embarrassed. 
"Guess that explains it, then," he said. "I wondered why my dad was acting so strange." 
"That's right." I faked an innocent expression. "He doesn't like the Cullens." 



"Superstitious old man," Jacob muttered under his breath. 

"You don't think he'd say anything to Charlie?" I couldn't help asking, the words corning out in a low 
msh. 

Jacob stared at me for a moment, and I couldn't read the expression in his dark eyes. "I doubt it," he 
finally answered. "I think Charlie chewed him out pretty good last time. They haven't spoken much since 
— tonight is sort of a reunion, I think. I don't think he'd bring it up again." 

"Oh," I said, trying to sound indifferent. 

I stayed in the front room after I carried the food out to Charlie, pretending to watch the game while 
Jacob chattered at me. I was really Ustening to the men's conversation, watching for any sign that Billy 
was about to rat me out, trying to think of ways to stop him if he began. 

It was a long night. I had a lot of homework that was going undone, but I was afraid to leave Billy alone 
with Charlie. Finally, the game ended. 

"Are you and your friends coming back to the beach soon?" Jacob asked as he pushed his father over 
the Up of the threshold. 

"I'm not sure," I hedged. 

"That was fun, Charlie," Billy said. 

"Come up for the next game," Charlie encouraged. 

"Sure, sure," Billy said. "We'll be here. Have a good night." His eyes shifted to mine, and his smile 
disappeared. "You take care, Bella," he added seriously. 

"Thanks," I muttered, looking away. 

I headed for the stairs while Charlie waved from the doorway. 
"Wait, Bella," he said. 

I cringed. Had Billy gotten something in before I'd joined them in the living room? 
But Charlie was relaxed, still grinning from the unexpected visit. 
"I didn't get a chance to talk to you tonight. How was your day?" 

"Good." I hesitated with one foot on the first stair, searching for details I could safely share. "My 
badminton team won all four games." 

"Wow, I didn't know you could play badminton." 

"Well, actually I can't, but my partner is really good," I admitted. 

"Who is it?" he asked with token interest. 

"Urn. . . Mike Newton," I told him reluctantiy. 

"Oh yeah — you said you were friends with the Newton kid." He perked up. "Nice family." He mused 
for a minute. "Why didn't you ask him to the dance this weekend?" 



"Dad!" I groaned. "He's kind of dating my friend Jessica. Besides, you know I can't dance." 

"Oh yeah," he muttered. Then he smiled at me apologetically. "So I guess it's good you'll be gone 
Saturday. . . I've made plans to go fishing with the guys from the station. The weather's supposed to be 
real warm. But if you wanted to put your trip off till someone could go with you, I'd stay home. I know I 
leave you here alone too much." 

"Dad, you're doing a great job." I smiled, hoping my relief didn't show. "I've never minded being alone — 
I'm too much like you." I winked at him, and he smiled his crinkly-eyed smile. 



I slept better that night, too tired to dream again. When I woke to the pearl gray morning, my mood was 
blissful. The tense evening with Billy and Jacob seemed harmless enough now; I decided to forget it 
completely. I caught myself whistling while I was pulling the front part of my hair back into a barrette, and 
later again as I skipped down the stairs. Charlie noticed. 

"You're cheerful this morning," he commented over breakfast. 

I shrugged. "It's Friday." 

I hurried so I would be ready to go the second Charlie left. I had my bag ready, shoes on, teeth brushed, 
but even though I rushed to the door as soon as I was sure Charlie would be out of sight, Edward was 
faster. He was waiting in his shiny car, windows down, engine off. 

I didn't hesitate this time, climbing in the passenger side quickly, the sooner to see his face. He grinned his 
crooked smile at me, stopping my breath and my heart. I couldn't imagine how an angel could be any 
more glorious. There was nothing about him that could be improved upon. 

"How did you sleep?" he asked. I wondered if he had any idea how appealing his voice was. 

"Fine. How was your night?" 

"Pleasant." His smile was amused; I felt like I was missing an inside joke. 
"Can I ask what you did?" I asked. 
"No." He grinned. "Today is still mine." 

He wanted to know about people today: more about Renee, her hobbies, what we'd done in our free 
time together. And then the one grandmother I'd known, my few school friends — embarrassing me 
when he asked about boys I'd dated. I was relieved that I'd never really dated anyone, so that particular 
conversation couldn't last long. He seemed as surprised as Jessica and Angela by my lack of romantic 
history. 

"So you never met anyone you wanted?" he asked in a serious tone that made me wonder what he was 
thinking about. 

I was grudgingly honest. "Not in Phoenix." 
His lips pressed together into a hard line. 

We were in the cafeteria at this point. The day had sped by in the blur that was rapidly becoming routine. 
I took advantage of his brief pause to take a bite of my bagel. 



"I should have let you drive yourself today," he announced, apropos of nothing, while I chewed. 

"Why?" I demanded. 

'Tm leaving with Alice after lunch." 

"Oh." I blinked, bewildered and disappointed. "That's okay, it's not that far of a walk." 

He frowned at me impatientiy. "I'm not going to make you walk home. We'll go get your truck and leave 
it here for you." 

"I don't have my key with me," I sighed. "I really don't mind walking." What I minded was losing my time 
with him. 

He shook his head. "Your truck will be here, and the key will be in the ignition — unless you're afraid 
someone might steal it." He laughed at the thought. 

"All right," I agreed, pursing my lips. I was pretty sure my key was in the pocket of a pair of jeans I wore 
Wednesday, under a pile of clothes in the laundry room. Even if he broke into my house, or whatever he 
was planning, he'd never find it. He seemed to feel the challenge in my consent. He smirked, 
overconfident. 

"So where are you going?" I asked as casually as I could manage. 

"Hunting," he answered grimly. "If I'm going to be alone with you tomorrow, I'm going to take whatever 
precautions I can." His face grew morose. . . and pleading. "You can always cancel, you know." 

I looked down, afraid of the persuasive power of his eyes. I refused to be convinced to fear him, no 
matter how real the danger might be. It doesn 't matter, I repeated in my head. 

"No," I whispered, glancing back at his face. "I can't." 

"Perhaps you're right," he murmured bleakly. His eyes seemed to darken in color as I watched. 

I changed the subject. "What time will I see you tomorrow?" I asked, already depressed by the thought 
of him leaving now. 

"That depends. . . it's a Saturday, don't you want to sleep in?" he offered. 

"No," I answered too fast. He restrained a smile. 

"The same time as usual, then," he decided. "Will Charlie be there?" 

"No, he's fishing tomorrow." I beamed at the memory of how conveniently things had worked out. 
His voice turned sharp. "And if you don't come home, what will he think?" 

"I have no idea," I answered coolly. "He knows I've been meaning to do the laundry. Maybe he'll think I 
fell in the washer." 

He scowled at me and I scowled back. His anger was much more impressive than mine. 

"What are you hunting tonight?" I asked when I was sure I had lost the glowering contest. 

"Whatever we find in the park. We aren't going far." He seemed bemused by my casual reference to his 
secret realities. 



"Why are you going with Alice?" I wondered. 

"Alice is the most. . . supportive." He frowned as he spoke. 

"And the others?" I asked timidly. "What are they?" 

His brow puckered for a brief moment. "Incredulous, for the most part." 

I peeked quickly behind me at his family. They sat staring off in different directions, exactly the same as 
the first time I'd seen them. Only now they were four; their beautiful, bronze-haired brother sat across 
from me, his golden eyes troubled. 

"They don't like me," I guessed. 

"That's not it," he disagreed, but his eyes were too innocent. "They don't understand why I can't leave 
you alone." 

I grimaced. "Neither do I, for that matter." 

Edward shook his head slowly, rolling his eyes toward the ceiling before he met my gaze again. "I told 
you — you don't see yourself clearly at all. You're not like anyone I've ever known. You fascinate me." 

I glared at him, sure he was teasing now. 

He smiled as he deciphered my expression. "Having the advantages I do," he murmured, touching his 
forehead discreetly, "I have a better than average grasp of human nature. People are predictable. But 
you. . . you never do what I expect. You always take me by surprise." 

I looked away, my eyes wandering back to his family, embarrassed and dissatisfied. His words made me 
feel like a science experiment. I wanted to laugh at myself for expecting anything else. 

"That part is easy enough to explain," he continued. I felt his eyes on my face but I couldn't look at him 
yet, afraid he might read the chagrin in my eyes. "But there's more. . . and it's not so easy to put into 
words — " 

I was still staring at the Cullens while he spoke. Suddenly Rosalie, his blond and breathtaking sister, 
turned to look at me. No, not to look — to glare, with dark, cold eyes. I wanted to look away, but her 
gaze held me until Edward broke off mid-sentence and made an angry noise under his breath. It was 
almost a hiss. 

Rosalie turned her head, and I was relieved to be free. I looked back at Edward — and I knew he could 
see the confusion and fear that widened my eyes. 

His face was tight as he explained. "I'm sorry about that. She's just worried. You see. . . it's dangerous for 
more than just me if, after spending so much time with you so publicly. . ." He looked down. 

"If?" 

"If this ends. . . badly." He dropped his head into his hands, as he had that night in Port Angeles. His 
anguish was plain; I yearned to comfort him, but I was at a loss to know how. My hand reached toward 
him involuntarily; quickly, though, I dropped it to the table, fearing that my touch would only make things 
worse. I realized slowly that his words should frighten me. I waited for that fear to come, but all I could 
seem to feel was an ache for his pain. 

And frustration — frustration that Rosalie had interrupted whatever he was about to say. I didn't know 



how to bring it up again. He still had his head in his hands. 

I tried to speak in a normal voice. "And you have to leave now?" 

"Yes." He raised his face; it was serious for a moment, and then his mood shifted and he smiled. "It's 
probably for the best. We still have fifteen minutes of that wretched movie left to endure in Biology — I 
don't think I could take any more." 

I started. Alice — her short, inky hair in a halo of spiky disarray around her exquisite, elfin face — was 
suddenly standing behind his shoulder. Her slight frame was willowy, graceful even in absolute stillness. 

He greeted her without looking away from me. "Alice." 

"Edward," she answered, her high soprano voice almost as attractive as his. 

"Alice, Bella — Bella, Alice," he introduced us, gesturing casually with his hand, a wry smile on his face. 

"Hello, Bella." Her brilliant obsidian eyes were unreadable, but her smile was friendly. "It's nice to finally 
meet you." 

Edward flashed a dark look at her. 

"Hi, Alice," I murmured shyly. 

"Are you ready?" she asked him. 

His voice was aloof. "Nearly. I'll meet you at the car." 

She left without another word; her walk was so fluid, so sinuous that I felt a sharp pang of jealousy. 

"Should I say 'have fun,' or is that the wrong sentiment?" I asked, turning back to him. 

"No, 'have fun' works as well as anything." He grinned. 

"Have fun, then." I worked to sound wholehearted. Of course I didn't fool him. 

"I'll try." He still grinned. "And you try to be safe, please." 

"Safe in Forks — what a challenge." 

"For you it is a challenge." His jaw hardened. "Promise." 

"I promise to try to be safe," I recited. "I'll do the laundry tonight — that ought to be fraught with peril." 

"Don't fall in," he mocked. 

"I'll do my best." 

He stood then, and I rose, too. 

"I'll see you tomorrow," I sighed. 

"It seems like a long time to you, doesn't it?" he mused. 

I nodded glumly. 

"I'll be there in the morning," he promised, smiling his crooked smile. He reached across the table to 



touch my face, lightly brushing along my cheekbone again. Then he turned and walked away. I stared 
after him until he was gone. 

I was sorely tempted to ditch the rest of the day, at the very least Gym, but a warning instinct stopped 
me. I knew that if I disappeared now, Mike and others would assume I was with Edward. And Edward 
was worried about the time we'd spent together publicly. . . if things went wrong. I refused to dwell on the 
last thought, concentrating instead on making things safer for him. 

I intuitively knew — and sensed he did, too — that tomorrow would be pivotal. Our relationship couldn't 
continue to balance, as it did, on the point of a knife. We would fall off one edge or the other, depending 
entirely upon his decision, or his instincts. My decision was made, made before I'd ever consciously 
chosen, and I was committed to seeing it through. Because there was nothing more terrifying to me, more 
excruciating, than the thought of turning away from him. It was an impossibility. 

I went to class, feeling dutiful. I couldn't honestly say what happened in Biology; my mind was too 
preoccupied with thoughts of tomorrow. In Gym, Mike was speaking to me again; he wished me a good 
time in Seattle. I carefully explained that I'd canceled my trip, worried about my truck. 

"Are you going to the dance with Cullen?" he asked, suddenly sulky. 

"No, I'm not going to the dance at all." 

"What are you doing, then?" he asked, too interested. 

My natural urge was to tell him to butt out. Instead, I lied brightly. 

"Laundry, and then I have to study for the Trig test or I'm going to fail." 

"Is Cullen helping you study?" 

"Edward" I emphasized, "is not going to help me study. He's gone away somewhere for the weekend." 
The lies came more naturally than usual, I noted with surprise. 

"Oh." He perked up. "You know, you could come to the dance with our group anyway — that would be 
cool. We'd all dance with you," he promised. 

The mental image of Jessica's face made my tone sharper than necessary. 
'Tm not going to the dance, Mike, okay?" 
"Fine." He sulked again. "I was just offering." 

When the school day had finally ended, I walked to the parking lot without enthusiasm. I did not 
especially want to walk home, but I couldn't see how he would have retrieved my truck. Then again, I 
was starting to believe that nothing was impossible for him. The latter instinct proved correct — my truck 
sat in the same space he'd parked his Volvo in this morning. I shook my head, incredulous, as I opened 
the unlocked door and saw the key in the ignition. 

There was a piece of white paper folded on my seat. I got in and closed the door before I unfolded it. 
Two words were written in his elegant script. 



Be safe. 



The sound of the truck roaring to life frightened me. I laughed at myself. 

When I got home, the handle of the door was locked, the dead bolt unlocked, just as I'd left it this 
morning. Inside, I went straight to the laundry room. It looked just the same as I'd left it, too. I dug for 
my jeans and, after finding them, checked the pockets. Empty. Maybe I'd hung my key up after all, I 
thought, shaking my head. 

Following the same instinct that had prompted me to lie to Mike, I called Jessica on the pretense of 
wishing her luck at the dance. When she offered the same wish for my day with Edward, I told her about 
the cancellation. She was more disappointed than really necessary for a third-party observer to be. I said 
goodbye quickly after that. 

Charlie was absentminded at dinner, worried over something at work, I guessed, or maybe a basketball 
game, or maybe he was just really enjoying the lasagna — it was hard to tell with Charlie. 

"You know, Dad. . . " I began, breaking into his reverie. 

"What's that, Bell?" 

"I think you're right about Seattle. I think I'll wait until Jessica or someone else can go with me." 
"Oh," he said, surprised. "Oh, okay. So, do you want me to stay home?" 

"No, Dad, don't change your plans. I've got a million things to do. . . homework, laundry. . . I need to go 
to the library and the grocery store. I'll be in and out all day. . . you go and have fun." 

"Are you sure?" 

"Absolutely, Dad. Besides, the freezer is getting dangerously low on fish — we're down to a two, maybe 
three years' supply." 

"You're sure easy to live with, Bella." He smiled. 

"I could say the same thing about you," I said, laughing. The sound of my laughter was off, but he didn't 
seem to notice. I felt so guilty for deceiving him that I almost took Edward's advice and told him where I 
would be. Almost. 

After dinner, I folded clothes and moved another load through the dryer. Unfortunately it was the kind of 
job that only keeps hands busy. My mind definitely had too much free time, and it was getting out of 
control. I fluctuated between anticipation so intense that it was very nearly pain, and an insidious fear that 
picked at my resolve. I had to keep reminding myself that I'd made my choice, and I wasn't going back 
on it. I pulled his note out of my pocket much more often than necessary to absorb the two small words 
he'd written. He wants me to be safe, I told myself again and again. I would just hold on to the faith that, 
in the end, that desire would win out over the others. And what was my other choice — to cut him out of 
my life? Intolerable. Besides, since I'd come to Forks, it really seemed like my life was about him 

But a tiny voice in the back of my mind worried, wondering if it would hurt very much. . . if it ended 
badly. 

I was relieved when it was late enough to be acceptable for bedtime. I knew I was far too stressed to 
sleep, so I did something I'd never done before. I deliberately took unnecessary cold medicine — the 
kind that knocked me out for a good eight hours. I normally wouldn't condone that type of behavior in 
myself, but tomorrow would be complicated enough without me being loopy from sleep deprivation on 
top of everything else. While I waited for the drugs to kick in, I dried my clean hair till it was impeccably 



straight, and fussed over what I would wear tomorrow. With everything ready for the morning, I finally 
lay in my bed. I felt hyper; I couldn't stop twitching. I got up and rifled through my shoebox of CDs until I 
found a collection of Chopin's nocturnes. I put that on very quietly and then lay down again, 
concentrating on relaxing individual parts of my body. Somewhere in the middle of that exercise, the cold 
pills took effect, and I gladly sank into unconsciousness. 



I woke early, having slept soundly and dreamlessly thanks to my gratuitous drug use. Though I was well 
rested, I slipped right back into the same hectic frenzy from the night before. I dressed in a rash, 
smoothing my collar against my neck, fidgeting with the tan sweater till it hung right over my jeans. I 
sneaked a swift look out the window to see that Charlie was already gone. A thin, cottony layer of 
clouds veiled the sky. They didn't look very lasting. 

I ate breakfast without tasting the food, hurrying to clean up when I was done. I peeked out the window 
again, but nothing had changed. I had just finished brushing my teeth and was heading back downstairs 
when a quiet knock sent my heart thudding against my rib cage. 

I flew to the door; I had a little trouble with the simple dead bolt, but I yanked the door open at last, and 
there he was. All the agitation dissolved as soon as I looked at his face, calm taking its place. I breathed 
a sigh of relief — yesterday's fears seemed very foolish with him here. 

He wasn't smiling at first — his face was somber. But then his expression lightened as he looked me 
over, and he laughed. 

"Good morning," he chuckled. 

"What's wrong?" I glanced down to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything important, like shoes, or pants. 

"We match." He laughed again. I realized he had a long, light tan sweater on, with a white collar showing 
underneath, and blue jeans. I laughed with him, hiding a secret twinge of regret — why did he have to 
look like a runway model when I couldn't? 

I locked the door behind me while he walked to the track. He waited by the passenger door with a 
martyred expression that was easy to understand. 

"We made a deal," I reminded him smugly, climbing into the driver's seat, and reaching over to unlock his 
door. 

"Where to?" I asked. 

"Put your seat belt on — I'm nervous already." 
I gave him a dirty look as I complied. 
"Where to?" I repeated with a sigh. 
"Take the one-oh-one north," he ordered. 

It was surprisingly difficult to concentrate on the road while feeling his gaze on my face. I compensated 
by driving more carefully than usual through the still-sleeping town. 

"Were you planning to make it out of Forks before nightfall?" 



"This track is old enough to be your car's grandfather — have some respect," I retorted. 



We were soon out of the town limits, despite his negativity. Thick underbrush and green-swathed trunks 
replaced the lawns and houses. 

"Turn right on the one-ten," he instructed just as I was about to ask. I obeyed silently. 
"Now we drive until the pavement ends." 

I could hear a smile in his voice, but I was too afraid of driving off the road and proving him right to look 
over and be sure. 

"And what's there, at the pavement's end?" I wondered. 
"A trail." 

"We're hiking?" Thank goodness I'd worn tennis shoes. 

"Is that a problem?" He sounded as if he'd expected as much. 

"No." I tried to make the he sound confident. But if he thought my truck was slow. . . 

"Don't worry, it's only five miles or so, and we're in no hurry." 

Five miles. I didn't answer, so that he wouldn't hear my voice crack in panic. Five miles of treacherous 
roots and loose stones, trying to twist my ankles or otherwise incapacitate me. This was going to be 
humiliating. 

We drove in silence for a while as I contemplated the coming horror. 
"What are you tliinking?" he asked impatiently after a few moments. 
I lied again. "Just wondering where we're going." 

"It's a place I like to go when the weather is nice." We both glanced out the windows at the thinning 
clouds after he spoke. 

"Charlie said it would be warm today." 

"And did you tell Charlie what you were up to?" he asked. 

"Nope." 

"But Jessica thinks we're going to Seattle together?" He seemed cheered by the idea. 

"No, I told her you canceled on me — which is true." 

"No one knows you're with me?" Angrily, now. 

"That depends. . . I assume you told Alice?" 

"That's very helpful, Bella," he snapped. 

I pretended I didn't hear that. 

"Are you so depressed by Forks that it's made you suicidal?" he demanded when I ignored him. 
"You said it might cause trouble for you. . . us being together publicly," I reminded him. 



"So you're worried about the trouble it might cause me — if you don't come homeT His voice was still 
angry, and bitingly sarcastic. 

I nodded, keeping my eyes on the road. 

He muttered something under his breath, speaking so quickly that I couldn't understand. 

We were silent for the rest of the drive. I could feel the waves of infuriated disapproval rolling off of him, 
and I could think of nothing to say. 

And then the road ended, constricting to a thin foot trail with a small wooden marker. I parked on the 
narrow shoulder and stepped out, afraid because he was angry with me and I didn't have driving as an 
excuse not to look at him. It was warm now, warmer than it had been in Forks since the day I'd arrived, 
almost muggy under the clouds. I pulled off my sweater and knotted it around my waist, glad that I'd 
worn the light, sleeveless shirt — especially if I had five miles of hiking ahead of me. 

I heard his door slam, and looked over to see that he'd removed his sweater, too. He was facing away 
from me, into the unbroken forest beside my truck. 

"This way," he said, glancing over his shoulder at me, eyes still annoyed. He started into the dark forest. 
"The trail?" Panic was clear in my voice as I hurried around the truck to catch up to him. 
"I said there was a trail at the end of the road, not that we were taking it." 
"No trail?" I asked desperately. 

"I won't let you get lost." He turned then, with a mocking smile, and I stifled a gasp. His white shirt was 
sleeveless, and he wore it unbuttoned, so that the smooth white skin of his throat flowed uninterrupted 
over the marble contours of his chest, his perfect musculature no longer merely hinted at behind 
concealing clothes. He was too perfect, I realized with a piercing stab of despair. There was no way this 
godlike creature could be meant for me. 

He stared at me, bewildered by my tortured expression. 

"Do you want to go home?" he said quietly, a different pain than mine saturating his voice. 

"No." I walked forward till I was close beside him, anxious not to waste one second of whatever time I 
might have with him. 

"What's wrong?" he asked, his voice gentle. 

"I'm not a good hiker," I answered dully. "You'll have to be very patient." 

"I can be patient — if I make a great effort." He smiled, holding my glance, trying to lift me out of my 
sudden, unexplained dejection. 

I tried to smile back, but the smile was unconvincing. He scrutinized my face. 

"I'll take you home," he promised. I couldn't tell if the promise was unconditional, or restricted to an 
immediate departure. I knew he thought it was fear that upset me, and I was grateful again that I was the 
one person whose mind he couldn't hear. 

"If you want me to hack five miles through the jungle before sundown, you'd better start leading the way," 
I said acidly. He frowned at me, struggling to understand my tone and expression. 



He gave up after a moment and led the way into the forest. 

It wasn't as hard as I had feared. The way was mostly flat, and he held the damp ferns and webs of moss 
aside for me. When his straight path took us over fallen trees or boulders, he would help me, hfting me by 
the elbow, and then releasing me instantly when I was clear. His cold touch on my skin never failed to 
make my heart thud erratically. Twice, when that happened, I caught a look on his face that made me 
sure he could somehow hear it. 

I tried to keep my eyes away from his perfection as much as possible, but I slipped often. Each time, his 
beauty pierced me through with sadness. 

For the most part, we walked in silence. Occasionally he would ask a random question that he hadn't 
gotten to in the past two days of interrogation. He asked about my birthdays, my grade school teachers, 
my childhood pets — and I had to admit that after killing three fish in a row, I'd given up on the whole 
institution. He laughed at that, louder than I was used to — bell-like echoes bouncing back to us from the 
empty woods. 

The hike took me most of the morning, but he never showed any sign of impatience. The forest spread 
out around us in a boundless labyrinth of ancient trees, and I began to be nervous that we would never 
find our way out again. He was perfectly at ease, comfortable in the green maze, never seeming to feel 
any doubt about our direction. 

After several hours, the light that filtered through the canopy transformed, the murky olive tone shifting to 
a brighter jade. The day had turned sunny, just as he'd foretold. For the first time since we'd entered the 
woods, I felt a thrill of excitement — which quickly turned to impatience. 

"Are we there yet?" I teased, pretending to scowl. 

"Nearly." He smiled at the change in my mood. "Do you see the brightness ahead?" 
I peered into the thick forest. "Urn, should I?" 
He smirked. "Maybe it's a bit soon for your eyes." 

"Time to visit the optometrist," I muttered. His smirk grew more pronounced. 

But then, after another hundred yards, I could definitely see a Ughtening in the trees ahead, a glow that 
was yellow instead of green. I picked up the pace, my eagerness growing with every step. He let me lead 
now, following noiselessly. 

I reached the edge of the pool of light and stepped through the last fringe of ferns into the loveliest place I 
had ever seen. The meadow was small, perfectly round, and filled with wildflowers — violet, yellow, and 
soft white. Somewhere nearby, I could hear the bubbling music of a stream. The sun was directly 
overhead, filling the circle with a haze of buttery sunshine. I walked slowly, awestruck, through the soft 
grass, swaying flowers, and warm, gilded air. I halfway turned, wanting to share this with him, but he 
wasn't behind me where I thought he'd be. I spun around, searching for him with sudden alarm. Finally I 
spotted him, still under the dense shade of the canopy at the edge of the hollow, watching me with 
cautious eyes. Only then did I remember what the beauty of the meadow had driven from my mind — 
the enigma of Edward and the sun, which he'd promised to illustrate for me today. 

I took a step back toward him, my eyes alight with curiosity. His eyes were wary, reluctant. I smiled 
encouragingly and beckoned to him with my hand, taking another step back to him. He held up a hand in 
warning, and I hesitated, rocking back onto my heels. 



Edward seemed to take a deep breath, and then he stepped out into the bright glow of the midday sun. 
13. CONFESSIONS 



Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, though I'd been staring at him all afternoon. 
His skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny 
diamonds were embedded in the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his 
sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His ghstening, pale lavender lids were shut, 
though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, 
glittering like crystal. 

Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he told 
me he was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear. 

I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to he back, 
as he did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to 
take my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around 
his motionless form. 

The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence. 

Hesitantiy, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real. . . 
hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within my 
reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his 
eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turned 
up the comers of his flawless hps. 

"I don't scare you?" he asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his soft voice. 
"No more than usual." 

He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. 

I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his forearm with my fingertips. 
I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his notice. 

"Do you mind?" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. 

"No," he said without opening his eyes. "You can't imagine how that feels." He sighed. 

I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed the faint pattern of bluish veins 
inside the crease at his elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I 
wished, he flipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his. It startled 
me; my fingers froze on his arm for a brief second. 

"Sorry," he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes close again. "It's too easy to be myself 
with you." 

I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his palm. I held it closer to my 
face, trying to see the hidden facets in his skin. 



"Tell me what you're thinking," he whispered. I looked to see his eyes watching me, suddenly intent. "It's 
still so strange for me, not knowing." 

"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time." 

"It's a hard life." Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? "But you didn't tell me." 

"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking. . . " I hesitated. 

"And?" 

"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishing that I wasn't afraid." 

"I don't want you to be afraid." His voice was just a soft murmur. I heard what he couldn't truthfully say, 
that I didn't need to be afraid, that there was nothing to fear. 

"Well, that's not exactiy the fear I meant, though that's certainly something to think about." 

So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up on his right arm, his left palm still 
in my hands. His angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have — should have — flinched 
away from his unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move. His golden eyes mesmerized me. 

"What are you afraid of, then?" he whispered intently. 

But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his cool breath in my face. Sweet, 
delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, untliinkingly, I leaned 
closer, inhaling. 

And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet 
away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his 
eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. 

I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. 

"I'm. . . sorry. . . Edward," I whispered. I knew he could hear. 

"Give me a moment," he called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still. 

After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. He stopped, still several feet away, 
and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine. He took two deep breaths, 
and then smiled in apology. 

"I am so very sorry." He hesitated. "Would you understand what I meant if I said I was only human?" 

I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization 
of danger slowly sank in. He could smell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. 

"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in — my voice, my face, even 
my smell. As if I need any of that!" Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantiy out of 
sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second. 

"As if you could outrun me," he laughed bitterly. 

He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch 
from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding 



speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow. 
And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. 
"As if you could fight me off," he said gentiy. 

I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'd never seen him so completely freed 
of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human. . . or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes 
wide, I sat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. 

His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the seconds passed, they dimmed. His 
expression slowly folded into a mask of ancient sadness. 

"Don't be afraid," he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionally seductive. "I promise. . . " He hesitated. "I 
swear not to hurt you." He seemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. 

"Don't be afraid," he whispered again as he stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, 
with deliberately unhurried movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. 

"Please forgive me," he said formally. "I can control myself. You caught me off guard. But I'm on my best 
behavior now." 

He waited, but I still couldn't speak. 

"I'm not thirsty today, honestiy." He winked. 

At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. 

"Are you all right?" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully, to place his marble hand back in 
mine. 

I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft, repentant. I looked back at his 
hand, and then deliberately returned to tracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and 
smiled timidly. 

His answering smile was dazzling. 

"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely?" he asked in the gentle cadences of an earlier century. 
"I honestly can't remember." 

He smiled, but his face was ashamed. "I think we were talking about why you were afraid, besides the 
obvious reason." 

"Oh, right." 

"Well?" 

I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth, iridescent palm. The seconds ticked 
by. 

"How easily frustrated I am," he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abrupdy grasping that this was every bit as 
new to him as it was to me. As many years of unfathomable experience as he had, this was hard for him, 
too. I took courage from that thought. 



"I was afraid. . . because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay with you. And I'm afraid that I'd like to 
stay with you, much more than I should." I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for me to 
say this aloud. 

"Yes," he agreed slowly. "That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really 
not in your best interest." 

I frowned. 

"I should have left long ago," he sighed. "I should leave now. But I don't know if I can." 
"I don't want you to leave," I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. 

"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company 
too much to do what I should." 

Tmglad." 

"Don't be!" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice was harsher than usual. Harsh for him, 
still more beautiful than any human voice. It was hard to keep up — his sudden mood changes left me 
always a step behind, dazed. 

"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I 
am to anyone else." He stopped, and I looked to see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. 

I thought for a moment. 

"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean — by that last part anyway," I said. 
He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. 

"How do I explain?" he mused. "And without frightening you again. . . lirnmmm." Without seeming to think 
about it, he placed his hand back in mine; I held it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. 

"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth." He sighed. 

A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. 

"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors?" he began. "Some people love chocolate ice cream, 
others prefer strawberry?" 

I nodded. 

"Sorry about the food analogy — I couldn't think of another way to explain." 
I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. 

"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If you locked an alcoholic in a room full 
of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. 
Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy, the rarest, finest cognac — 
and filled the room with its warm aroma — how do you think he would fare then?" 

We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes — trying to read each other's thoughts. 

He broke the silence first. 



"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy. Perhaps I 
should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead." 

"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?" I teased, trying to lighten the mood. 

He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. "Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin." 

"Does that happen often?" I asked. 

He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. 

"I spoke to my brothers about it." He still stared into the distance. "To Jasper, every one of you is much 
the same. He's the most recent to join our family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had 
time to grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor." He glanced swiftly at me, his expression 
apologetic. 

"Sorry," he said. 

"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me, or whichever. That's the way 
you think. I can understand, or I can try to at least. Just explain however you can." 

He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. 

"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as" — he hesitated, looking for the 
right word — "appealing as you are to me. Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon 
longer, so to speak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, once stronger than the 
other." 

"And for you?" 
"Never." 

The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. 
"What did Emmett do?" I asked to break the silence. 

It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenched into a fist inside mine. He 
looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going to answer. 

"I guess I know," I finally said. 

He lifted his eyes; his expression was wistful, pleading. 

"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we?" 

"What are you asking? My permission?" My voice was sharper than I'd intended. I tried to make my 
tone kinder — I could guess what his honesty must cost him. "I mean, is there no hope, then?" How 
calmly I could discuss my own death! 

"No, no!" He was instantly contrite. "Of course there's hope! I mean, of course I won't. . ." He left the 
sentence hanging. His eyes burned into mine. "It's different for us. Emmett. . . these were strangers he 
happened across. It was a long time ago, and he wasn't as. . . practiced, as careful, as he is now." 

He fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through. 



"So if we'd met. . . oh, in a dark alley or something. . . " I trailed off. 

"It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class full of children and — " He stopped 
abruptiy, looking away. "When you walked past me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for 
us, right then and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well, too many years, I wouldn't 
have been able to stop myself." He paused, scowling at the trees. 

He glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. "You must have thought I was possessed." 
"I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly. . ." 

"To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin 
me. The fragrance coming off your skin. . . I thought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one 
hour, I thought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, to get you alone. And I 
fought them each back, thinking of my family, what I could do to them. I had to run out, to get away 
before I could speak the words that would make you follow. . . " 

He looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb his bitter memories. His golden eyes 
scorched from under his lashes, hypnotic and deadly. 

"You would have come," he promised. 

I tried to speak calmly. "Without a doubt." 

He frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his stare. "And then, as I tried to 
rearrange my schedule in a pointiess attempt to avoid you, you were there — in that close, warm littie 
room, the scent was maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one other frail human 
there — so easily dealt with." 

I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his eyes, only now grasping the danger. 
Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at how close I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her death. 

"But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you, not to follow you from the school. 
It was easier outside, when I couldn't smell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I 
left the others near home — I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was, they only knew something 
was very wrong — and then I went straight to Carlisle, at the hospital, to tell him I was leaving." 

I stared in surprise. 

"I traded cars with him — he had a full tank of gas and I didn't want to stop. I didn't dare to go home, to 
face Esme. She wouldn't have let me go without a scene. She would have tried to convince me that it 
wasn't necessary... 

"By the next morning I was in Alaska." He sounded ashamed, as if admitting a great cowardice. "I spent 
two days there, with some old acquaintances. . . but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme, 
and the rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains it was hard to believe you were 
so irresistible. I convinced myself it was weak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of this 
magnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, an insignificant little girl" — he grinned 
suddenly — "to chase me from the place I wanted to be? So I came back. . . " He stared off into space. 

I couldn't speak. 

"I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing you again. I was sure that I was 
strong enough to treat you like any other human. I was arrogant about it. 



"It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your 
reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in 
Jessica's mind. . . her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that. And then I 
couldn't know if you really meant what you said. It was all extremely irritating." He frowned at the 
memory. 

"I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so I tried to talk with you like I would with 
any person. I was eager actually, hoping to decipher some of your thoughts. But you were too interesting, 
I found myself caught up in your expressions . . . and every now and then you would stir the air with your 
hand or your hair, and the scent would stun me again. . . 

"Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly 
good excuse for why I acted at that moment — because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been 
spilled there in front of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing us for what we are. 
But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time, all I could think was, 'Not her.'" 

He closed his eyes, lost in his agonized confession. I listened, more eager than rational. Common sense 
told me I should be terrified. Instead, I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with 
compassion for his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. 

I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. "In the hospital?" 

His eyes flashed up to mine. "I was appalled. I couldn't believe I had put us in danger after all, put myself 
in your power — you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you." We both flinched as that 
word slipped out. "But it had the opposite effect," he continued quickly. "I fought with Rosalie, Emmett, 
and Jasper when they suggested that now was the time. . . the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided 
with me, and Alice." He grimaced when he said her name. I couldn't imagine why. "Esme told me to do 
whatever I had to in order to stay." He shook his head indulgently. 

"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to, shocked that you kept your 
word. I didn't understand you at all. But I knew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my 
very best to stay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin, your breath, your 
hair. . . it hit me as hard as the very first day." 

He met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender. 

"And for all that," he continued, "I'd have fared better if I had exposed us all at that first moment, than if 
now, here — with no witnesses and nothing to stop me — I were to hurt you." 

I was human enough to have to ask. "Why?" 

"Isabella." He pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffled my hair with his free hand. A 
shock ran through my body at his casual touch. "Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You 
don't know how it's tortured me." He looked down, ashamed again. "The thought of you, still, white, 
cold. . . to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see 
through my pretenses. . . it would be unendurable." He lifted his glorious, agonized eyes to mine. "You are 
the most important thing to me now. The most important thing to me ever." 

My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversation had taken. From the cheerful 
topic of my impending demise, we were suddenly declaring ourselves. He waited, and even though I 
looked down to study our hands between us, I knew his golden eyes were on me. "You already know 
how I feel, of course," I finally said. "I'm here. . . which, roughly translated, means I would rather die than 
stay away from you." I frowned. "I'm an idiot." 



"You are an idiot," he agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed, too. We laughed together at the 
idiocy and sheer impossibility of such a moment. 

"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb ..." he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to 
the word. 

"What a stupid lamb," I sighed. 

"What a sick, masochistic lion." He stared into the shadowy forest for a long moment, and I wondered 
where his thoughts had taken him. 

"Why. . . ?" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. 
He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth. 
"Yes?" 

"Tell me why you ran from me before." 
His smile faded. "You know why." 

"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning 
what I shouldn't do. This, for example" — I stroked the back of his hand — "seems to be all right." 

He smiled again. "You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault." 

"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you." 

"Well. . . " He contemplated for a moment. "It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy 
away from us, are repelled by our alienness. . . I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of 
your throat." He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. 

"Okay, then," I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tense atmosphere. I tucked my chin. "No 
throat exposure." 

It worked; he laughed. "No, really, it was more the surprise than anything else." 

He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. I sat very still, the chill of his touch a 
natural warning — a warning telling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. There were, 
however, other feelings. . . 

"You see," he said. "Perfectly fine." 

My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this must make everything so much more 
difficult — the thudding of my pulse in my veins. Surely he could hear it. 

"The blush on your cheeks is lovely," he murmured. He gently freed his other hand. My hands fell limply 
into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek, then held my face between his marble hands. 

"Be very still," he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. 

Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he rested 
his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted 
to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and wind play in his bronze hair, more 
human than any other part of him. 



With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. I shivered, and I heard him catch his 
breath. But his hands didn't pause as they softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. 

His face drifted to the side, his nose slamming across my collarbone. He came to rest with the side of his 
face pressed tenderly against my chest. 

Listening to my heart. 

"Ah," he sighed. 

I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours. Eventually the throb of my pulse 
quieted, but he didn't move or speak again as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, 
and my life could end — so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn't make myself be afraid. I 
couldn't think of anything, except that he was touching me. 

And then, too soon, he released me. 

His eyes were peaceful. 

"It won't be so hard again," he said with satisfaction. 
"Was that very hard for you?" 

"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you?" 
"No, it wasn't bad. . . for me." 
He smiled at my inflection. "You know what I mean." 
I smiled. 

"Here." He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. "Do you feel how warm it is?" 

And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for I was touching his face, something 
I'd dreamed of constantly since the first day I'd seen him. 

"Don't move," I whispered. 

No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became as immobile as stone, a carving under 
my hand. 

I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpected move. I caressed his cheek, 
delicately stroked his eyelid, the purple shadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his 
perfect nose, and then, so carefully, his flawless hps. His hps parted under my hand, and I could feel his 
cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to lean in, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and 
leaned away, not wanting to push him too far. 

He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear, but rather to tighten the 
muscles in the pit of my stomach and send my pulse hammering through my veins again. 

"I wish," he whispered, "I wish you could feel the. . . complexity. . . the confusion. . . I feel. That you could 
understand." 

He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face. 



"Tell me," I breathed. 

"I don't think I can. I've told you, on the one hand, the hunger — the thirst — that, deplorable creature 
that I am, I feel for you. And I think you can understand that, to an extent. Though" — he half-smiled — 
"as you are not addicted to any illegal substances, you probably can't empathize completely. 

"But. . . " His fingers touched my lips lightiy, making me shiver again. "There are other hungers. Hungers I 
don't even understand, that are foreign to me." 

"I may understand that better than you think." 

"I'm not used to feeling so human. Is it always like this?" 

"Forme?" I paused. "No, never. Never before this." 

He held my hands between his. They felt so feeble in his iron strength. 

"I don't know how to be close to you," he admitted. "I don't know if I can." 

I leaned forward very slowly, cautioning him with my eyes. I placed my cheek against his stone chest. I 
could hear his breath, and nothing else. 

"This is enough," I sighed, closing my eyes. 

In a very human gesture, he put his arms around me and pressed his face against my hair. 

"You're better at this than you give yourself credit for," I noted. 

"I have human instincts — they may be buried deep, but they're there." 

We sat like that for another immeasurable moment; I wondered if he could be as unwilling to move as I 
was. But I could see the light was fading, the shadows of the forest beginning to touch us, and I sighed. 

"You have to go." 

"I thought you couldn't read my mind." 

"It's getting clearer." I could hear a smile in his voice. 

He took my shoulders and I looked into his face. 

"Can I show you something?" he asked, sudden excitement flaring in his eyes. 
"Show me what?" 

"I'll show you how / travel in the forest." He saw my expression. "Don't worry, you'll be very safe, and 
we'll get to your truck much faster." His mouth twitched up into that crooked smile so beautiful my heart 
nearly stopped. 

"Will you turn into a bat?" I asked warily. 

He laughed, louder than I'd ever heard. "Like I haven't heard that one before!" 
"Right, I'm sure you get that all the time." 
"Come on, little coward, climb on my back." 



I waited to see if he was kidding, but, apparently, he meant it. He smiled as he read my hesitation, and 
reached for me. My heart reacted; even though he couldn't hear my thoughts, my pulse always gave me 
away. He then proceeded to sling me onto his back, with very little effort on my part, besides, when in 
place, clamping my legs and arms so tightiy around him that it would choke a normal person. It was like 
clinging to a stone. 

"I'm a bit heavier than your average backpack," I warned. 

"Hah!" he snorted. I could almost hear his eyes rolling. I'd never seen him in such high spirits before. 
He startled me, suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing my palm to his face, and inhaling deeply. 
"Easier all the time," he muttered. 
And then he was mrining. 

If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now. 

He streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like a bullet, like a ghost. There was no 
sound, no evidence that his feet touched the earth. His breathing never changed, never indicated any 
effort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us by inches. 

I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whipped against my face and burned them. 
I felt as if I were stupidly sticking my head out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time in 
my life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness. 

Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow, and now, in a matter of 
minutes, we were back to the truck. 

"Exhilarating, isn't it?" His voice was high, excited. 

He stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but my muscles wouldn't respond. My arms 
and legs stayed locked around him while my head spun uncomfortably. 

"Bella?" he asked, anxious now. 

"I think I need to he down," I gasped. 

"Oh, sorry." He waited for me, but I still couldn't move. 

"I think I need help," I admitted. 

He laughed quietly, and gentiy unloosened my stranglehold on his neck. There was no resisting the iron 
strength of his hands. Then he pulled me around to face him, cradling me in his arms like a small child. He 
held me for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns. 

"How do you feel?" he asked. 

I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. "Dizzy, I think." 
"Put your head between your knees." 

I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him sitting 
beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow 
ringing sound in my ears. 



"I guess that wasn't the best idea," he mused. 

I tried to be positive, but my voice was weak. "No, it was very interesting." 

"Hah! You're as white as a ghost — no, you're as white as me !" 

"I think I should have closed my eyes." 

"Remember that next time." 

"Next time!" I groaned. 

He laughed, his mood still radiant. 

"Show-off," I muttered. 

"Open your eyes, Bella," he said quietiy. 

And he was right there, his face so close to mine. His beauty stunned my mind — it was too much, an 
excess I couldn't grow accustomed to. 

"I was thinking, while I was running. . . " He paused. 

"About not hitting the trees, I hope." 

"Silly Bella," he chuckled. "Running is second nature to me, it's not something I have to think about." 
"Show-off," I muttered again. 
He smiled. 

"No," he continued, "I was thinking there was something I wanted to try." And he took my face in his 
hands again. 

I couldn't breathe. 

He hesitated — not in the normal way, the human way. 

Not the way a man might hesitate before he kissed a woman, to gauge her reaction, to see how he would 
be received. Perhaps he would hesitate to prolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation, 
sometimes better than the kiss itself. 

Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make sure he was still in control of his need. 
And then his cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine. 
What neither of us was prepared for was my response. 

Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my hps. My breath came in a wild gasp. My fingers knotted in his 
hair, clutching him to me. My lips parted as I breathed in his heady scent. 

Immediately I felt him turn to unresponsive stone beneath my hps. His hands gently, but with irresistible 
force, pushed my face back. I opened my eyes and saw his guarded expression. 

"Oops," I breathed. 



"That's an understatement." 

His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he didn't lapse from his perfect articulation. 
He held my face just inches from his. He dazzled my eyes. 

"Should I. . . ?" I tried to disengage myself, to give him some room. 

His hands refused to let me move so much as an inch. 

"No, it's tolerable. Wait for a moment, please." His voice was polite, controlled. 
I kept my eyes on his, watched as the excitement in them faded and gentled. 
Then he smiled a surprisingly impish grin. 
"There," he said, obviously pleased with himself. 
"Tolerable?" I asked. 

He laughed aloud. "I'm stronger than I thought. It's nice to know." 

"I wish I could say the same. I'm sorry." 

"You are only human, after all." 

"Thanks so much," I said, my voice acerbic. 

He was on his feet in one of his lithe, almost invisibly quick movements. He held out his hand to me, an 
unexpected gesture. I was so used to our standard of careful non-contact. I took his icy hand, needing 
the support more than I thought. My balance had not yet returned. 

"Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?" How Ughthearted, how human he 
seemed as he laughed now, his seraphic face untroubled. He was a different Edward than the one I had 
known. And I felt all the more besotted by him. It would cause me physical pain to be separated from 
him now. 

"I can't be sure, I'm still woozy," I managed to respond. "I think it's some of both, though." 
"Maybe you should let me drive." 
"Are you insane?" I protested. 

"I can drive better than you on your best day," he teased. "You have much slower reflexes." 
"I'm sure that's true, but I don't think my nerves, or my truck, could take it." 
"Some trust, please, Bella." 

My hand was in my pocket, curled tightly around the key. I pursed my hps, deliberated, then shook my 
head with a tight grin. 

"Nope. Not a chance." 

He raised his eyebrows in disbelief. 

I started to step around him, heading for the driver's side. He might have let me pass if I hadn't wobbled 



slightly. Then again, he might not have. His arm created an inescapable snare around my waist. 

"Bella, I've already expended a great deal of personal effort at this point to keep you alive. I'm not about 
to let you behind the wheel of a vehicle when you can't even walk straight. Besides, friends don't let 
friends drive drunk," he quoted with a chuckle. I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance corning off 
his chest. 

"Drunk?" I objected. 

"You're intoxicated by my very presence." He was grinning that playful smirk again. 

"I can't argue with that," I sighed. There was no way around it; I couldn't resist him in anything. I held the 
key high and dropped it, watching his hand flash like Ughtning to catch it soundlessly. "Take it easy — my 
truck is a senior citizen." 

"Very sensible," he approved. 

"And are you not affected at all?" I asked, irked. "By my presence?" 

Again his mobile features transformed, his expression became soft, warm. He didn't answer at first; he 
simply bent his face to mine, and brushed his lips slowly along my jaw, from my ear to my chin, back and 
forth. I trembled. 

"Regardless," he finally murmured, "I have better reflexes." 
14. MIND OVER MATTER 



He could drive well, when he kept the speed reasonable, I had to admit. Like so many things, it seemed 
to be effortless to him. He barely looked at the road, yet the tires never deviated so much as a centimeter 
from the center of the lane. He drove one-handed, holding my hand on the seat. Sometimes he gazed into 
the setting sun, sometimes he glanced at me — my face, my hair blowing out the open window, our 
hands twined together. 

He had turned the radio to an oldies station, and he sang along with a song I'd never heard. He knew 
every line. 

"You like fifties music?" I asked. 

"Music in the fifties was good. Much better than the sixties, or the seventies, ugh!" He shuddered. "The 
eighties were bearable." 

"Are you ever going to tell me how old you are?" I asked, tentative, not wanting to upset his buoyant 
humor. 

"Does it matter much?" His smile, to my relief, remained unclouded. 

"No, but I still wonder. . . " I grimaced. "There's nothing like an unsolved mystery to keep you up at night." 
"I wonder if it will upset you," he reflected to himself. He gazed into the sun; the minutes passed. 



"Try me," I finally said. 



He sighed, and then looked into my eyes, seeming to forget the road completely for a time. Whatever he 
saw there must have encouraged him. He looked into the sun — the light of the setting orb glittered off 
his skin in ruby-tinged sparkles — and spoke. 

"I was born in Chicago in 1901." He paused and glanced at me from the corner of his eyes. My face was 
carefully unsurprised, patient for the rest. He smiled a tiny smile and continued. "Carlisle found me in a 
hospital in the summer of 1918. 1 was seventeen, and dying of the Spanish influenza." 

He heard my intake of breath, though it was barely audible to my own ears. He looked down into my 
eyes again. 

"I don't remember it well — it was a very long time ago, and human memories fade." He was lost in his 
thoughts for a short time before he went on. "I do remember how it felt, when Carlisle saved me. It's not 
an easy thing, not something you could forget." 

"Your parents?" 

"They had already died from the disease. I was alone. That was why he chose me. In all the chaos of the 
epidemic, no one would ever realize I was gone." 

"How did he. . . save you?" 

A few seconds passed before he answered. He seemed to choose his words carefully. 

"It was difficult. Not many of us have the restraint necessary to accomplish it. But Carlisle has always 
been the most humane, the most compassionate of us. . . I don't think you could find his equal throughout 
all of history." He paused. "For me, it was merely very, very painful." 

I could tell from the set of his lips, he would say no more on this subject. I suppressed my curiosity, 
though it was far from idle. There were many things I needed to think through on this particular issue, 
things that were only beginning to occur to me. No doubt his quick mind had already comprehended 
every aspect that eluded me. 

His soft voice interrupted my thoughts. "He acted from loneliness. That's usually the reason behind the 
choice. I was the first in Carlisle's family, though he found Esme soon after. She fell from a cliff. They 
brought her straight to the hospital morgue, though, somehow, her heart was still beating." 

"So you must be dying, then, to become. . . " We never said the word, and I couldn't frame it now. 

"No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do that to someone who had another choice." The respect in his 
voice was profound whenever he spoke of his father figure. "It is easier he says, though," he continued, "if 
the blood is weak." He looked at the now-dark road, and I could feel the subject closing again. 

"And Emmett and Rosalie?" 

"Carlisle brought Rosalie to our family next. I didn't realize till much later that he was hoping she would be 
to me what Esme was to him — he was careful with his thoughts around me." He rolled his eyes. "But 
she was never more than a sister. It was only two years later that she found Emmett. She was hunting — 
we were in Appalachia at the time — and found a bear about to finish him off. She carried him back to 
Carlisle, more than a hundred miles, afraid she wouldn't be able to do it herself. I'm only beginning to 
guess how difficult that journey was for her." He threw a pointed glance in my direction, and raised our 
hands, still folded together, to brush my cheek with the back of his hand. 

"But she made it," I encouraged, looking away from the unbearable beauty of his eyes. 



"Yes," he murmured. "She saw something in his face that made her strong enough. And they've been 
together ever since. Sometimes they live separately from us, as a married couple. But the younger we 
pretend to be, the longer we can stay in any given place. Forks seemed perfect, so we all enrolled in high 
school." He laughed. "I suppose we'll have to go to their wedding in a few years, again." 

"Alice and Jasper?" 

"Alice and Jasper are two very rare creatures. They both developed a conscience, as we refer to it, with 
no outside guidance. Jasper belonged to another. . . family, a very different kind of family. He became 
depressed, and he wandered on his own. Alice found him. Like me, she has certain gifts above and 
beyond the norm for our kind." 

"Really?" I interrupted, fascinated. "But you said you were the only one who could hear people's 
thoughts." 

"That's true. She knows other things. She sees things — things that might happen, things that are corning. 
But it's very subjective. The future isn't set in stone. Things change." 

His jaw set when he said that, and his eyes darted to my face and away so quickly that I wasn't sure if I 
only imagined it. 

"What kinds of things does she see?" 

"She saw Jasper and knew that he was looking for her before he knew it himself. She saw Carlisle and 
our family, and they came together to find us. She's most sensitive to non-humans. She always sees, for 
example, when another group of our kind is corning near. And any threat they may pose." 

"Are there a lot of. . . your kind?" I was surprised. How many of them could walk among us undetected? 

"No, not many. But most won't settle in any one place. Only those like us, who've given up hunting you 
people" — a sly glance in my direction — "can live together with humans for any length of time. We've 
only found one other family like ours, in a small village in Alaska. We lived together for a time, but there 
were so many of us that we became too noticeable. Those of us who live. . . differently tend to band 
together." 

"And the others?" 

"Nomads, for the most part. We've all lived that way at times. It gets tedious, like anything else. But we 
run across the others now and then, because most of us prefer the North." 

"Why is that?" 

We were parked in front of my house now, and he'd turned off the truck. It was very quiet and dark; 
there was no moon. The porch light was off so I knew my father wasn't home yet. 

"Did you have your eyes open this afternoon?" he teased. "Do you think I could walk down the street in 
the sunlight without causing traffic accidents? There's a reason why we chose the Olympic Peninsula, one 
of the most sunless places in the world. It's nice to be able to go outside in the day. You wouldn't believe 
how tired you can get of nighttime in eighty-odd years." 

"So that's where the legends came from?" 



"Probably." 



"And Alice came from another family, like Jasper?" 

"No, and that is a mystery. Alice doesn't remember her human life at all. And she doesn't know who 
created her. She awoke alone. Whoever made her walked away, and none of us understand why, or 
how, he could. If she hadn't had that other sense, if she hadn't seen Jasper and Carlisle and known that 
she would someday become one of us, she probably would have turned into a total savage." 

There was so much to think through, so much I still wanted to ask. But, to my great embarrassment, my 
stomach growled. I'd been so intrigued, I hadn't even noticed I was hungry. I realized now that I was 
ravenous. 

"I'm sorry, I'm keeping you from dinner." 
Tm fine, really." 

"I've never spent much time around anyone who eats food. I forget." 

"I want to stay with you." It was easier to say in the darkness, knowing as I spoke how my voice would 
betray me, my hopeless addiction to him. 

"Can't I come in?" he asked. 

"Would you like to?" I couldn't picture it, this godlike creature sitting in my father's shabby kitchen chair. 

"Yes, if it's all right." I heard the door close quietly, and almost simultaneously he was outside my door, 
opening it for me. 

"Very human," I complimented him. 
"It's definitely resurfacing." 

He walked beside me in the night, so quietly I had to peek at him constantly to be sure he was still there. 
In the darkness he looked much more normal. Still pale, still dreamlike in his beauty, but no longer the 
fantastic sparkling creature of our sunlit afternoon. 

He reached the door ahead of me and opened it for me. I paused halfway through the frame. 

"The door was unlocked?" 

"No, I used the key from under the eave." 

I stepped inside, flicked on the porch light, and turned to look at him with my eyebrows raised. I was 
sure I'd never used that key in front of him. 

"I was curious about you." 

"You spied on me?" But somehow I couldn't infuse my voice with the proper outrage. I was flattered. 
He was unrepentant. "What else is there to do at night?" 

I let it go for the moment and went down the hall to the kitchen. He was there before me, needing no 
guide. He sat in the very chair I'd tried to picture him in. His beauty lit up the kitchen. It was a moment 
before I could look away. 

I concentrated on getting my dinner, taking last night's lasagna from the fridge, placing a square on a 



plate, heating it in the microwave. It revolved, filling the kitchen with the smell of tomatoes and oregano. I 
didn't take my eyes from the plate of food as I spoke. 

"How often?" I asked casually. 

"Hmmm?" He sounded as if I had pulled him from some other train of thought. 
I still didn't turn around. "How often did you come here?" 
"I come here almost every night." 
I whirled, stunned. "Why?" 

"You're interesting when you sleep." He spoke matter-of-factly. "You talk." 

"No!" I gasped, heat flooding my face all the way to my hairline. I gripped the kitchen counter for 
support. I knew I talked in my sleep, of course; my mother teased me about it. I hadn't thought it was 
something I needed to worry about here, though. 

His expression shifted instantiy to chagrin. "Are you very angry with me?" 

"That depends!" I felt and sounded like I'd had the breath knocked out of me. 

He waited. 

"On?" he urged. 

"What you heard!" I wailed. 

Instantly, silently, he was at my side, taking my hands carefully in his. 

"Don't be upset!" he pleaded. He dropped his face to the level of my eyes, holding my gaze. I was 
embarrassed. I tried to look away. 

"You miss your mother," he whispered. "You worry about her. And when it rains, the sound makes you 
restless. You used to talk about home a lot, but it's less often now. Once you said, It's too green. "' He 
laughed softly, hoping, I could see, not to offend me further. 

"Anything else?" I demanded. 

He knew what I was getting at. "You did say my name," he admitted. 

I sighed in defeat. "A lot?" 

"How much do you mean by 'a lot,' exactly?" 

"Oh no!" I hung my head. 

He pulled me against his chest, softly, naturally. 

"Don't be self-conscious," he whispered in my ear. "If I could dream at all, it would be about you. And 
I'm not ashamed of it." 

Then we both heard the sound of tires on the brick driveway, saw the headlights flash through the front 
windows, down the hall to us. I stiffened in his arms. 



"Should your father know I'm here?" he asked. 
"I'm not sure. . . " I tried to think it through quickly. 
"Another time then. . . " 
And I was alone. 
"Edward!" I hissed. 

I heard a ghostiy chuckle, then nothing else. 
My father's key turned in the door. 

"Bella?" he called. It had bothered me before; who else would it be? Suddenly he didn't seem so far off 
base. 

"In here." I hoped he couldn't hear the hysterical edge to my voice. I grabbed my dinner from the 
microwave and sat at the table as he walked in. His footsteps sounded so noisy after my day with 
Edward. 

"Can you get me some of that? I'm bushed." He stepped on the heels of his boots to take them off, 
holding the back of Edward's chair for support. 

I took my food with me, scarfing it down as I got his dinner. It burned my tongue. I filled two glasses with 
milk while his lasagna was heating, and gulped mine to put out the fire. As I set the glass down, I noticed 
the milk trembling and realized my hand was shaking. Charlie sat in the chair, and the contrast between 
him and its former occupant was comical. 

"Thanks," he said as I placed his food on the table. 

"How was your day?" I asked. The words were rushed; I was dying to escape to my room. 

"Good. The fish were biting. . . how about you? Did you get everything done that you wanted to?" 

"Not really — it was too nice out to stay indoors." I took another big bite. 

"It was a nice day," he agreed. What an understatement, I thought to myself. 

Finished with the last bite of lasagna, I lifted my glass and chugged the remains of my milk. 

Charlie surprised me by being observant. "In a hurry?" 

"Yeah, I'm tired. I'm going to bed early." 

"You look kinda keyed up," he noted. Why, oh why, did this have to be his night to pay attention? 

"Do I?" was all I could manage in response. I quickly scrubbed my dishes clean in the sink, and placed 
them upside down on a dish towel to dry. 

"It's Saturday," he mused. 

I didn't respond. 

"No plans tonight?" he asked suddenly. 



"No, Dad, I just want to get some sleep." 

"None of the boys in town your type, eh?" He was suspicious, but trying to play it cool. 

"No, none of the boys have caught my eye yet." I was careful not to over-emphasize the word boys in 
my quest to be truthful with Charlie. 

"I thought maybe that Mike Newton. . . you said he was friendly." 
"He's Just a friend, Dad." 

"Well, you're too good for them all, anyway. Wait till you get to college to start looking." Every father's 
dream, that his daughter will be out of the house before the hormones kick in. 

"Sounds like a good idea to me," I agreed as I headed up the stairs. 

'"Night, honey," he called after me. No doubt he would be listening carefully all evening, waiting for me to 
try to sneak out. 

"See you in the morning, Dad." See you creeping into my room tonight at midnight to check on me. 

I worked to make my tread sound slow and tired as I walked up the stairs to my room. I shut the door 
loud enough for him to hear, and then sprinted on my tiptoes to the window. I threw it open and leaned 
out into the night. My eyes scanned the darkness, the impenetrable shadows of the trees. 

"Edward?" I whispered, feeling completely idiotic. 

The quiet, laughing response came from behind me. "Yes?" 

I whirled, one hand flying to my throat in surprise. 

He lay, smiling hugely, across my bed, his hands behind his head, his feet dangling off the end, the picture 
of ease. 

"Oh!" I breathed, sinking unsteadily to the floor. 

"I'm sorry." He pressed his hps together, trying to hide his amusement. 

"Just give me a minute to restart my heart." 

He sat up slowly, so as not to startle me again. Then he leaned forward and reached out with his long 
arms to pick me up, gripping the tops of my arms like I was a toddler. He sat me on the bed beside him. 

"Why don't you sit with me," he suggested, putting a cold hand on mine. "How's the heart?" 

"You tell me — I'm sure you hear it better than I do." 

I felt his quiet laughter shake the bed. 

We sat there for a moment in silence, both listening to my heartbeat slow. I thought about having Edward 
in my room, with my father in the house. 

"Can I have a minute to be human?" I asked. 

"Certainly." He gestured with one hand that I should proceed. 



"Stay," I said, trying to look severe. 

"Yes, ma'am." And he made a show of becoming a statue on the edge of my bed. 

I hopped up, grabbing my pajamas from off the floor, my bag of toiletries off the desk. I left the light off 
and slipped out, closing the door. 

I could hear the sound from the TV rising up the stairs. I banged the bathroom door loudly, so Charlie 
wouldn't come up to bother me. 

I meant to hurry. I brushed my teeth fiercely, trying to be thorough and speedy, removing all traces of 
lasagna. But the hot water of the shower couldn't be rushed. It unknotted the muscles in my back, calmed 
my pulse. The familiar smell of my shampoo made me feel like I might be the same person I had been this 
morning. I tried not to think of Edward, sitting in my room, waiting, because then I had to start all over 
with the calming process. Finally, I couldn't delay anymore. I shut off the water, toweling hastily, rushing 
again. I pulled on my holey t-shirt and gray sweatpants. Too late to regret not packing the Victoria's 
Secret silk pajamas my mother got me two birthdays ago, which still had the tags on them in a drawer 
somewhere back home. 

I rubbed the towel through my hair again, and then yanked the brush through it quickly. I threw the towel 
in the hamper, flung my brush and toothpaste into my bag. Then I dashed down the stairs so Charlie 
could see that I was in my pajamas, with wet hair. 

'"Night, Dad." 

'"Night, Bella." He did look startled by my appearance. Maybe that would keep him from checking on 
me tonight. 

I took the stairs two at a time, trying to be quiet, and flew into my room, closing the door tightly behind 
me. 

Edward hadn't moved a fraction of an inch, a carving of Adonis perched on my faded quilt. I smiled, and 
his hps twitched, the statue coming to life. 

His eyes appraised me, taking in the damp hair, the tattered shirt. He raised one eyebrow. "Nice." 
I grimaced. 

"No, it looks good on you." 

"Thanks," I whispered. I went back to his side, sitting cross-legged beside him. I looked at the lines in the 
wooden floor. 

"What was all that for?" 

"Charlie thinks I'm sneaking out." 

"Oh." He contemplated that. "Why?" As if he couldn't know Charlie's mind much more clearly than I 
could guess. 

"Apparently, I look a little overexcited." 
He lifted my chin, examining my face. 



"You look very warm, actually." 



He bent his face slowly to mine, laying his cool cheek against my skin. I held perfectly still. 
''Mmmmmm. . . " he breathed. 

It was very difficult, while he was touching me, to frame a coherent question. It took me a minute of 
scattered concentration to begin. 

"It seems to be. . . much easier for you, now, to be close to me." 

"Does it seem that way to you?" he murmured, his nose gliding to the comer of my jaw. I felt his hand, 
lighter than a moth's wing, brushing my damp hair back, so that his hps could touch the hollow beneath 
my ear. 

"Much, much easier," I said, trying to exhale. 
"Hmm" 

"So I was wondering. . . " I began again, but his fingers were slowly tracing my collarbone, and I lost my 
train of thought. 

"Yes?" he breathed. 

"Why is that," my voice shook, embarrassing me, "do you think?" 

I felt the tremor of his breath on my neck as he laughed. "Mind over matter." 

I pulled back; as I moved, he froze — and I could no longer hear the sound of his breathing. 

We stared cautiously at each other for a moment, and then, as his clenched jaw gradually relaxed, his 
expression became puzzled. 

"Did I do something wrong?" 

"No — the opposite. You're driving me crazy," I explained. 

He considered that briefly, and when he spoke, he sounded pleased. "Really?" A triumphant smile slowly 
lit his face. 

"Would you like a round of applause?" I asked sarcastically. 
He grinned. 

"I'm just pleasantly surprised," he clarified. "In the last hundred years or so," his voice was teasing, "I 
never imagined anything like this. I didn't believe I would ever find someone I wanted to be with. . . in 
another way than my brothers and sisters. And then to find, even though it's all new to me, that I'm good 
at it. . . at being with you. . . " 

"You're good at everything," I pointed out. 

He shrugged, allowing that, and we both laughed in whispers. 

"But how can it be so easy now?" I pressed. "This afternoon. . ." 

"It's not easy," he sighed. "But this afternoon, I was still. . . undecided. I am sorry about that, it was 
unforgivable for me to behave so." 



"Not unforgivable," I disagreed. 



"Thank you." He smiled. "You see," he continued, looking down now, "I wasn't sure if I was strong 
enough. . . " He picked up one of my hands and pressed it tightly to his face. "And while there was still that 
possibility that I might be. . . overcome" — he breathed in the scent at my wrist — "I was. . . susceptible. 
Until I made up my mind that I was strong enough, that there was no possibility at all that I would. . . that 
I ever could..." 

I'd never seen him struggle so hard for words. It was so. . . human. 
"So there's no possibility now?" 

"Mind over matter," he repeated, smiling, his teeth bright even in the darkness. 
"Wow, that was easy," I said. 

He threw back his head and laughed, quietly as a whisper, but still exuberantly. 
"Easy for you !" he amended, touching my nose with his fingertip. 
And then his face was abruptly serious. 

"I'm trying," he whispered, his voice pained. "If it gets to be. . . too much, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to 
leave." 

I scowled. I didn't like the talk of leaving. 

"And it will be harder tomorrow," he continued. "I've had the scent of you in my head all day, and I've 
grown amazingly desensitized. If I'm away from you for any length of time, I'll have to start over again. 
Not quite from scratch, though, I think." 

"Don't go away, then," I responded, unable to hide the longing in my voice. 

"That suits me," he replied, his face relaxing into a gentle smile. "Bring on the shackles — I'm your 
prisoner." But his long hands formed manacles around my wrists as he spoke. He laughed his quiet, 
musical laugh. He'd laughed more tonight than I'd ever heard in all the time I'd spent with him. 

"You seem more. . . optimistic than usual," I observed. "I haven't seen you like this before." 

"Isn't it supposed to be like this?" He smiled. "The glory of first love, and all that. It's incredible, isn't it, 
the difference between reading about something, seeing it in the pictures, and experiencing it?" 

"Very different," I agreed. "More forceful than I'd imagined." 

"For example" — his words flowed swiftly now, I had to concentrate to catch it all — "the emotion of 
jealousy. I've read about it a hundred thousand times, seen actors portray it in a thousand different plays 
and movies. I believed I understood that one pretty clearly. But it shocked me. . . " He grimaced. "Do you 
remember the day that Mike asked you to the dance?" 

I nodded, though I remembered that day for a different reason. "The day you started talking to me again." 

"I was surprised by the flare of resentment, almost fury, that I felt — I didn't recognize what it was at 
first. I was even more aggravated than usual that I couldn't know what you were thinking, why you 
refused him. Was it simply for your friend's sake? Was there someone else? I knew I had no right to care 
either way. I tried not to care. 



"And then the line started forming,'' he chuckled. I scowled in the darkness. 

"I waited, unreasonably anxious to hear what you would say to them, to watch your expressions. I 
couldn't deny the relief I felt, watching the annoyance on your face. But I couldn't be sure. 

"That was the first night I came here. I wrestled all night, while watching you sleep, with the chasm 
between what I knew was right, moral, ethical, and what I wanted. I knew that if I continued to ignore 
you as I should, or if I left for a few years, till you were gone, that someday you would say yes to Mike, 
or someone like him. It made me angry. 

"And then," he whispered, "as you were sleeping, you said my name. You spoke so clearly, at first I 
thought you'd woken. But you rolled over restlessly and mumbled my name once more, and sighed. The 
feeling that coursed through me then was unnerving, staggering. And I knew I couldn't ignore you any 
longer." He was silent for a moment, probably listening to the suddenly uneven pounding of my heart. 

"But jealousy. . . it's a strange thing. So much more powerful than I would have thought. And irrational! 
Just now, when Charlie asked you about that vile Mike Newton. . ." He shook his head angrily. 

"I should have known you'd be listening," I groaned. 

"Of course." 

"That made you feel jealous, though, really?" 

"I'm new at this; you're resurrecting the human in me, and everything feels stronger because it's fresh." 

"But honestiy," I teased, "for that to bother you, after I have to hear that Rosalie — Rosalie, the 
incarnation of pure beauty, Rosalie — was meant for you. Emmett or no Emmett, how can I compete 
with that?" 

"There's no competition." His teeth gleamed. He drew my trapped hands around his back, holding me to 
his chest. I kept as still as I could, even breathing with caution. 

"I know there's no competition," I mumbled into his cold skin. "That's the problem." 

"Of course Rosalie is beautiful in her way, but even if she wasn't like a sister to me, even if Emmett didn't 
belong with her, she could never have one tenth, no, one hundredth of the attraction you hold for me." He 
was serious now, thoughtful. "For almost ninety years I've walked among my kind, and yours. .. all the 
time tliinking I was complete in myself, not realizing what I was seeking. And not finding anything, 
because you weren't alive yet." 

"It hardly seems fair," I whispered, my face still resting on his chest, listening to his breath come and go. "I 
haven't had to wait at all. Why should I get off so easily?" 

"You're right," he agreed with amusement. "I should make this harder for you, definitely." He freed one of 
his hands, released my wrist, only to gather it carefully into his other hand. He stroked my wet hair softly, 
from the top of my head to my waist. "You only have to risk your life every second you spend with me, 
that's surely not much. You only have to turn your back on nature, on humanity. . . what's that worth?" 

"Very Utile — I don't feel deprived of anything." 

"Not yet." And his voice was abruptiy full of ancient grief. 

I tried to pull back, to look in his face, but his hand locked my wrists in an unbreakable hold. 



"What — " I started to ask, when his body became alert. I froze, but he suddenly released my hands, and 
disappeared. I narrowly avoided falling on my face. 

"Lie down!" he hissed. I couldn't tell where he spoke from in the darkness. 

I rolled under my quilt, balling up on my side, the way I usually slept. I heard the door crack open, as 
Charlie peeked in to make sure I was where I was supposed to be. I breathed evenly, exaggerating the 
movement. 

A long minute passed. I listened, not sure if I'd heard the door close. Then Edward's cool arm was 
around me, under the covers, his lips at my ear. 

"You are a terrible actress — I'd say that career path is out for you." 

"Dam it," I muttered. My heart was crashing in my chest. 

He hummed a melody I didn't recognize; it sounded like a lullaby. 

He paused. "Should I sing you to sleep?" 

"Right," I laughed. "Like I could sleep with you here!" 

"You do it all the time," he reminded me. 

"But I didn't know you were here," I replied icily. 

"So if you don't want to sleep. . ." he suggested, ignoring my tone. My breath caught. 

"If I don't want to sleep... ?" 

He chuckled. "What do you want to do then?" 

I couldn't answer at first. 

"I'm not sure," I finally said. 

"Tell me when you decide." 

I could feel his cool breath on my neck, feel his nose sliding along my jaw, inhaling. 
"I thought you were desensitized." 

"Just because I'm resisting the wine doesn't mean I can't appreciate the bouquet," he whispered. "You 
have a very floral smell, like lavender. . . or freesia," he noted. "It's mouthwatering." 

"Yeah, it's an off day when I don't get somebody telling me how edible I smell." 

He chuckled, and then sighed. 

"I've decided what I want to do," I told him. "I want to hear more about you." 
"Ask me anything." 

I sifted through my questions for the most vital. "Why do you do it?" I said. "I still don't understand how 
you can work so hard to resist what you. . . are. Please don't misunderstand, of course I'm glad that you 
do. I just don't see why you would bother in the first place." 



He hesitated before answering. "That's a good question, and you are not the first one to ask it. The others 
— the majority of our kind who are quite content with our lot — they, too, wonder at how we live. But 
you see, just because we've been. . . dealt a certain hand. . . it doesn't mean that we can't choose to rise 
above — to conquer the boundaries of a destiny that none of us wanted. To try to retain whatever 
essential humanity we can." 

I lay unmoving, locked in awed silence. 

"Did you fall asleep?" he whispered after a few minutes. 

"No." 

"Is that all you were curious about?" 
I rolled my eyes. "Not quite." 
"What else do you want to know?" 

"Why can you read minds — why only you? And Alice, seeing the future. . . why does that happen?" 

I felt him shrug in the darkness. "We don't really know. Carlisle has a theory. . . he believes that we all 
bring something of our strongest human traits with us into the next life, where they are intensified — like 
our minds, and our senses. He thinks that I must have already been very sensitive to the thoughts of those 
around me. And that Alice had some precognition, wherever she was." 

"What did he bring into the next life, and the others?" 

"Carlisle brought his compassion. Esme brought her ability to love passionately. Emmett brought his 
strength, Rosalie her. . . tenacity. Or you could call it pigheadedness." he chuckled. "Jasper is very 
interesting. He was quite charismatic in his first life, able to influence those around him to see things his 
way. Now he is able to manipulate the emotions of those around him — calm down a room of angry 
people, for example, or excite a lethargic crowd, conversely. It's a very subtle gift." 

I considered the impossibilities he described, trying to take it in. He waited patiently while I thought. 

"So where did it all start? I mean, Carlisle changed you, and then someone must have changed him, and 
so on..." 

"Well, where did you come from? Evolution? Creation? Couldn't we have evolved in the same way as 
other species, predator and prey? Or, if you don't believe that all this world could have just happened on 
its own, which is hard for me to accept myself, is it so hard to believe that the same force that created the 
delicate angelfish with the shark, the baby seal and the killer whale, could create both our kinds 
together?" 

"Let me get this straight — I'm the baby seal, right?" 

"Right." He laughed, and something touched my hair — his hps? 

I wanted to turn toward him, to see if it was really his hps against my hair. But I had to be good; I didn't 
want to make this any harder for him than it already was. 

"Are you ready to sleep?" he asked, interrupting the short silence. "Or do you have any more questions?" 
"Only a million or two." 



"We have tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. . . " he reminded me. I smiled, euphoric at the 
thought 

"Are you sure you won't vanish in the morning?" I wanted this to be certain. "You are mythical, after all." 
"I won't leave you." His voice had the seal of a promise in it. 

"One more, then, tonight. . . " And I blushed. The darkness was no help — I'm sure he could feel the 
sudden warmth under my skin. 

"What is it?" 

"No, forget it. I changed my mind." 
"Bella, you can ask me anything." 
I didn't answer, and he groaned. 

"I keep thinking it will get less frustrating, not hearing your thoughts. But it just gets worse and worse!' 
"I'm glad you can't read my thoughts. It's bad enough that you eavesdrop on my sleep-talking." 
"Please?" His voice was so persuasive, so impossible to resist. 
I shook my head. 

"If you don't tell me, I'll just assume it's something much worse than it is," he threatened darkly. "Please?" 
Again, that pleading voice. 

"Well," I began, glad that he couldn't see my face. 

"Yes?" 

"You said that Rosalie and Emmett will get married soon. . . Is that. . . marriage. . . the same as it is for 
humans?" 

He laughed in earnest now, understanding. "Is that what you're getting at?" 
I fidgeted, unable to answer. 

"Yes, I suppose it is much the same," he said. "I told you, most of those human desires are there, just 
hidden behind more powerful desires." 

"Oh," was all I could say. 

"Was there a purpose behind your curiosity?" 

"Well, I did wonder. . . about you and me. . . someday. . . " 

He was instantly serious, I could tell by the sudden stillness of his body. I froze, too, reacting 
automatically. 

"I don't think that. . . that. . . would be possible for us." 
"Because it would be too hard for you, if I were that. . . close?" 



"That's certainly a problem. But that's not what I was thinking of. It's just that you are so soft, so fragile. I 
have to mind my actions every moment that we're together so that I don't hurt you. I could kill you quite 
easily, Bella, simply by accident." His voice had become just a soft murmur. He moved his icy palm to 
rest it against my cheek. "If I was too hasty. . . if for one second I wasn't paying enough attention, I could 
reach out, meaning to touch your face, and crush your skull by mistake. You don't realize how incredibly 
breakable you are. I can never, never afford to lose any kind of control when I'm with you." 

He waited for me to respond, growing anxious when I didn't. "Are you scared?" he asked. 

I waited for a minute to answer, so the words would be true. "No. I'm fine." 

He seemed to deliberate for a moment. "I'm curious now, though," he said, his voice light again. "Have 
you ever. . . ?" He trailed off suggestively. 

"Of course not." I flushed. "I told you I've never felt like this about anyone before, not even close." 

"I know. It's just that I know other people's thoughts. I know love and lust don't always keep the same 
company." 

"They do for me. Now, anyway, that they exist for me at all," I sighed. 

"That's nice. We have that one thing in common, at least." He sounded satisfied. 

"Your human instincts. . ." I began. He waited. "Well, do you find me attractive, in that way, at all?" 

He laughed and lightly rumpled my nearly dry hair. 

"I may not be a human, but I am a man," he assured me. 

I yawned involuntarily. 

"I've answered your questions, now you should sleep," he insisted. 
"I'm not sure if I can." 
"Do you want me to leave?" 
"No!" I said too loudly. 

He laughed, and then began to hum that same, unfamiUar lullaby; the voice of an archangel, soft in my ear. 

More tired than I realized, exhausted from the long day of mental and emotional stress like I'd never felt 
before, I drifted to sleep in his cold arms. 

15. THE CULLENS 

The muted light of yet another cloudy day eventually woke me. I lay with my arm across my eyes, groggy 
and dazed. Something, a dream trying to be remembered, struggled to break into my consciousness. I 
moaned and rolled on my side, hoping more sleep would come. And then the previous day flooded back 
into my awareness. 

"Oh!" I sat up so fast it made my head spin. 



"Your hair looks like a haystack. . . but I like it." His unruffled voice came from the rocking chair in the 
corner. 

"Edward! You stayed!" I rejoiced, and thoughtlessly threw myself across the room and into his lap. In the 
instant that my thoughts caught up with my actions, I froze, shocked by my own uncontrolled enthusiasm. 
I stared up at him, afraid that I had crossed the wrong line. 

But he laughed. 

"Of course," he answered, startled, but seeming pleased by my reaction. His hands rubbed my back. 
I laid my head cautiously against his shoulder, breathing in the smell of his skin. 
"I was sure it was a dream." 
"You're not that creative," he scoffed. 

"Charlie!" I remembered, thoughtlessly jumping up again and heading to the door. 

"He left an hour ago — after reattaching your battery cables, I might add. I have to admit I was 
disappointed. Is that really all it would take to stop you, if you were determined to go?" 

I deliberated where I stood, wanting to return to him badly, but afraid I might have morning breath. 

"You're not usually this confused in the morning," he noted. He held his arms open for me to return. A 
nearly irresistible invitation. 

"I need another human minute," I admitted. 

"IH wait." 

I skipped to the bathroom, my emotions unrecognizable. I didn't know myself, inside or out. The face in 
the mirror was practically a stranger — eyes too bright, hectic spots of red across my cheekbones. After 
I brushed my teeth, I worked to straighten out the tangled chaos that was my hair. I splashed my face 
with cold water, and tried to breathe normally, with no noticeable success. I half-ran back to my room. 

It seemed like a miracle that he was there, his arms still waiting for me. He reached out to me, and my 
heart thumped unsteadily. 

"Welcome back," he murmured, taking me into his arms. 

He rocked me for a while in silence, until I noticed that his clothes were changed, his hair smooth. 

"You left?" I accused, touching the collar of his fresh shirt. 

"I could hardly leave in the clothes I came in — what would the neighbors think?" 

I pouted. 

"You were very deeply asleep; I didn't miss anything." His eyes gleamed. "The talking came earlier." 

I groaned. "What did you hear?" 

His gold eyes grew very soft. "You said you loved me." 

"You knew that already," I reminded him, ducking my head. 



"It was nice to hear, just the same." 

I hid my face against his shoulder. 

"I love you," I whispered. 

"You are my life now," he answered simply. 

There was nothing more to say for the moment. He rocked us back and forth as the room grew lighter. 

"Breakfast time," he said eventually, casually — to prove, I'm sure, that he remembered all my human 
frailties. 

So I clutched my throat with both hands and stared at him with wide eyes. Shock crossed his face. 
"Kidding!" I snickered. "And you said I couldn't act!" 
He frowned in disgust. "That wasn't funny." 

"It was very funny, and you know it." But I examined his gold eyes carefully, to make sure that I was 
forgiven. Apparentiy, I was. 

"Shall I rephrase?" he asked. "Breakfast time for the human." 
"Oh, okay." 

He threw me over his stone shoulder, gently, but with a swiftness that left me breathless. I protested as he 
carried me easily down the stairs, but he ignored me. He sat me right side up on a chair. 

The kitchen was bright, happy, seeming to absorb my mood. 

"What's for breakfast?" I asked pleasantly. 

That threw him for a minute. 

"Er, I'm not sure. What would you like?" His marble brow puckered. 
I grinned, hopping up. 

"That's all right, I fend for myself pretty well. Watch me hunt." 

I found a bowl and a box of cereal. I could feel his eyes on me as I poured the milk and grabbed a 
spoon. I sat my food on the table, and then paused. 

"Can I get you anything?" I asked, not wanting to be rude. 

He rolled his eyes. "Just eat, Bella." 

I sat at the table, watching him as I took a bite. He was gazing at me, studying my every movement. It 
made me self-conscious. I cleared my mouth to speak, to distract him. 

"What's on the agenda for today?" I asked. 

"Hmmm. . . " I watched him frame his answer carefully. "What would you say to meeting my family?" 
I gulped. 



"Are you afraid now?" He sounded hopeful. 

"Yes," I admitted; how could I deny it — he could see my eyes. 

"Don't worry." He smirked. "I'll protect you." 

"I'm not afraid of them" I explained. "I'm afraid they won't. . . like me. Won't they be, well, surprised that 
you would bring someone. . . like me. . . home to meet them? Do they know that I know about them?" 

"Oh, they already know everything. They'd taken bets yesterday, you know" — he smiled, but his voice 
was harsh — "on whether I'd bring you back, though why anyone would bet against Alice, I can't 
imagine. At any rate, we don't have secrets in the family. It's not really feasible, what with my mind 
reading and Alice seeing the future and all that." 

"And Jasper making you feel all warm and fuzzy about spilling your guts, don't forget that." 
"You paid attention," he smiled approvingly. 

"I've been known to do that every now and then." I grimaced. "So did Alice see me coming?" 

His reaction was strange. "Something like that," he said uncomfortably, turning away so I couldn't see his 
eyes. I stared at him curiously. 

"Is that any good?" he asked, turning back to me abruptly and eyeing my breakfast with a teasing look on 
his face. "Honestly, it doesn't look very appetizing." 

"Well, it's no irritable grizzly. . . " I murmured, ignoring him when he glowered. I was still wondering why 
he responded that way when I mentioned Alice. I hurried through my cereal, speculating. 

He stood in the middle of the kitchen, the statue of Adonis again, staring abstractedly out the back 
windows. 

Then his eyes were back on me, and he smiled his heartbreaking smile. 

"And you should introduce me to your father, too, I think." 

"He already knows you," I reminded him. 

"As your boyfriend, I mean." 

I stared at him with suspicion. "Why?" 

"Isn't that customary?" he asked innocentiy. 

"I don't know," I admitted. My dating history gave me few reference points to work with. Not that any 
normal rules of dating applied here. "That's not necessary, you know. I don't expect you to. . . I mean, 
you don't have to pretend for me." 

His smile was patient. "I'm not pretending." 

I pushed the remains of my cereal around the edges of the bowl, biting my lip. 
"Are you going to tell Charlie I'm your boyfriend or not?" he demanded. 

"Is that what you are?" I suppressed my internal cringing at the thought of Edward and Charlie and the 
word boyfriend all in the same room at the same time. 



"It's a loose interpretation of the word "boy,' I'll admit." 

"I was under the impression that you were something more, actually," I confessed, looking at the table. 

"Well, I don't know if we need to give him all the gory details." He reached across the table to lift my chin 
with a cold, gentie finger. "But he will need some explanation for why I'm around here so much. I don't 
want Chief Swan getting a restraining order put on me." 

"Will you be?" I asked, suddenly anxious. "Will you really be here?" 

"As long as you want me," he assured me. 

"I'll always want you," I warned him. "Forever." 

He walked slowly around the table, and, pausing a few feet away, he reached out to touch his fingertips 
to my cheek. His expression was unfathomable. 

"Does that make you sad?" I asked. 

He didn't answer. He stared into my eyes for an immeasurable period of time. 

"Are you finished?" he finally asked. 

I jumped up. "Yes." 

"Get dressed — I'll wait here." 

It was hard to decide what to wear. I doubted there were any etiquette books detailing how to dress 
when your vampire sweetheart takes you home to meet his vampire family. It was a relief to think the 
word to myself. I knew I shied away from it intentionally. 

I ended up in my only skirt — long, khaki-colored, still casual. I put on the dark blue blouse he'd once 
complimented. A quick glance in the mirror told me my hair was entirely impossible, so I pulled it back 
into a pony tail. 

"Okay." I bounced down the stairs. "I'm decent." 

He was waiting at the foot of the stairs, closer than I'd thought, and I bounded right into him. He steadied 
me, holding me a careful distance away for a few seconds before suddenly pulling me closer. 

"Wrong again," he murmured in my ear. "You are utterly indecent — no one should look so tempting, it's 
not fair." 

"Tempting how?" I asked. "I can change. 

He sighed, shaking his head. "You are so absurd." He pressed his cool lips delicately to my forehead, 
and the room spun. The smell of his breath made it impossible to think. 

"Shall I explain how you are tempting me?" he said. It was clearly a rhetorical question. His fingers traced 
slowly down my spine, his breath corning more quickly against my skin. My hands were limp on his 
chest, and I felt lightheaded again. He tilted his head slowly and touched his cool lips to mine for the 
second time, very carefully, parting them slightiy. 

And then I collapsed. 



"Bella?" His voice was alarmed as he caught me and held me up. 
"You. . . made. . . me. . . faint," I accused him dizzily. 

"What am I going to do with youT he groaned in exasperation. "Yesterday I kiss you, and you attack 
me! Today you pass out on me!" 

I laughed weakly, letting his arms support me while my head spun. 
"So much for being good at everything," he sighed. 

"That's the problem." I was still dizzy. "You're too good. Far, far too good." 
"Do you feel sick?" he asked; he'd seen me like this before. 

"No — that wasn't the same kind of fainting at all. I don't know what happened." I shook my head 
apologetically, "I think I forgot to breathe." 

"I can't take you anywhere like this." 

"I'm fine," I insisted. "Your family is going to think I'm insane anyway, what's the difference?" 

He measured my expression for a moment. "I'm very partial to that color with your skin," he offered 
unexpectedly. I flushed with pleasure, and looked away. 

"Look, I'm trying really hard not to think about what I'm about to do, so can we go already?" I asked. 

"And you're worried, not because you're headed to meet a houseful of vampires, but because you think 
those vampires won't approve of you, correct?" 

"That's right," I answered immediately, hiding my surprise at his casual use of the word. 
He shook his head. "You're incredible." 

I realized, as he drove my truck out of the main part of town, that I had no idea where he lived. We 
passed over the bridge at the Calawah River, the road winding northward, the houses flashing past us 
growing farther apart, getting bigger. And then we were past the other houses altogether, driving through 
misty forest. I was trying to decide whether to ask or be patient, when he turned abruptly onto an 
unpaved road. It was unmarked, barely visible among the ferns. The forest encroached on both sides, 
leaving the road ahead only discernible for a few meters as it twisted, serpentiike, around the ancient 
trees. 

And then, after a few miles, there was some thinning of the woods, and we were suddenly in a small 
meadow, or was it actually a lawn? The gloom of the forest didn't relent, though, for there were six 
primordial cedars that shaded an entire acre with their vast sweep of branches. The trees held their 
protecting shadow right up to the walls of the house that rose among them, making obsolete the deep 
porch that wrapped around the first story. 

I don't know what I had expected, but it definitely wasn't this. The house was timeless, graceful, and 
probably a hundred years old. It was painted a soft, faded white, three stories tall, rectangular and well 
proportioned. The windows and doors were either part of the original structure or a perfect restoration. 
My truck was the only car in sight. I could hear the river close by, hidden in the obscurity of the forest. 



"Wow." 



"You like it?" He smiled. 



"It. . . has a certain charm." 

He pulled the end of my ponytail and chuckled. 

"Ready?" he asked, opening my door. 

"Not even a little bit — let's go." I tried to laugh, but it seemed to get stuck in my throat. I smoothed my 
hair nervously. 

"You look lovely." He took my hand easily, without tliinking about it. 

We walked through the deep shade up to the porch. I knew he could feel my tension; his thumb rubbed 
soothing circles into the back of my hand. 

He opened the door for me. 

The inside was even more surprising, less predictable, than the exterior. It was very bright, very open, 
and very large. This must have originally been several rooms, but the walls had been removed from most 
of the first floor to create one wide space. The back, south-facing wall had been entirely replaced with 
glass, and, beyond the shade of the cedars, the lawn stretched bare to the wide river. A massive curving 
staircase dominated the west side of the room. The walls, the high-beamed ceiling, the wooden floors, 
and the thick carpets were all varying shades of white. 

Waiting to greet us, standing just to the left of the door, on a raised portion of the floor by a spectacular 
grand piano, were Edward's parents. 

I'd seen Dr. Cullen before, of course, yet I couldn't help but be struck again by his youth, his outrageous 
perfection. At his side was Esme, I assumed, the only one of the family I'd never seen before. She had 
the same pale, beautiful features as the rest of them. Something about her heart-shaped face, her billows 
of soft, caramel-colored hair, reminded me of the ingenues of the silent-movie era. She was small, 
slender, yet less angular, more rounded than the others. They were both dressed casually, in light colors 
that matched the inside of the house. They smiled in welcome, but made no move to approach us. Trying 
not to frighten me, I guessed. 

"Carlisle, Esme," Edward's voice broke the short silence, "this is Bella." 

"You're very welcome, Bella." Carlisle's step was measured, careful as he approached me. He raised his 
hand tentatively, and I stepped forward to shake hands with him. 

"It's nice to see you again, Dr. Cullen." 

"Please, call me Carlisle." 

"Carlisle." I grinned at him, my sudden confidence surprising me. I could feel Edward's relief at my side. 

Esme smiled and stepped forward as well, reaching for my hand. Her cold, stone grasp was just as I 
expected. 

"It's very nice to know you," she said sincerely. 

"Thank you. I'm glad to meet you, too." And I was. It was like meeting a fairy tale — Snow White, in the 
flesh. 



"Where are Alice and Jasper?" Edward asked, but no one answered, as they had just appeared at the 
top of the wide staircase. 

"Hey, Edward!" Alice called enthusiastically. She ran down the stairs, a streak of black hair and white 
skin, corning to a sudden and graceful stop in front of me. Carlisle and Esme shot warning glances at her, 
but I liked it. It was natural — for her, anyway. 

"Hi, Bella!" Alice said, and she bounced forward to kiss my cheek. If Carlisle and Esme had looked 
cautious before, they now looked staggered. There was shock in my eyes, too, but I was also very 
pleased that she seemed to approve of me so entirely. I was startled to feel Edward stiffen at my side. I 
glanced at his face, but his expression was unreadable. 

"You do smell nice, I never noticed before," she commented, to my extreme embarrassment. 

No one else seemed to know quite what to say, and then Jasper was there — tall and leonine. A feeling 
of ease spread through me, and I was suddenly comfortable despite where I was. Edward stared at 
Jasper, raising one eyebrow, and I remembered what Jasper could do. 

"Hello, Bella," Jasper said. He kept his distance, not offering to shake my hand. But it was impossible to 
feel awkward near him. 

"Hello, Jasper." I smiled at him shyly, and then at the others. "It's nice to meet you all — you have a very 
beautiful home," I added conventionally. 

"Thank you," Esme said. "We're so glad that you came." She spoke with feeling, and I realized that she 
thought I was brave. 

I also realized that Rosalie and Emmett were nowhere to be seen, and I remembered Edward's 
too-innocent denial when I'd asked him if the others didn't like me. 

Carlisle's expression distracted me from this train of thought; he was gazing meaningfully at Edward with 
an intense expression. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward nod once. 

I looked away, trying to be polite. My eyes wandered again to the beautiful instrument on the platform by 
the door. I suddenly remembered my childhood fantasy that, should I ever win a lottery, I would buy a 
grand piano for my mother. She wasn't really good — she only played for herself on our secondhand 
upright — but I loved to watch her play. She was happy, absorbed — she seemed like a new, 
mysterious being to me then, someone outside the "mom" persona I took for granted. She'd put me 
through lessons, of course, but like most kids, I whined until she let me quit. 

Esme noticed my preoccupation. 

"Do you play?" she asked, inchning her head toward the piano. 
I shook my head. "Not at all. But it's so beautiful. Is it yours?" 
"No," she laughed. "Edward didn't tell you he was musical?" 

"No." I glared at his suddenly innocent expression with narrowed eyes. "I should have known, I guess." 

Esme raised her delicate eyebrows in confusion. 

"Edward can do everything, right?" I explained. 

Jasper snickered and Esme gave Edward a reproving look. 



"I hope you haven't been showing off — it's rude," she scolded. 

"Just a bit," he laughed freely. Her face softened at the sound, and they shared a brief look that I didn't 
understand, though Esme's face seemed almost smug. 

"He's been too modest, actually," I corrected. 

"Well, play for her," Esme encouraged. 

"You just said showing off was rude," he objected. 

"There are exceptions to every rule," she replied. 

"I'd like to hear you play," I volunteered. 

"It's settled then." Esme pushed him toward the piano. He pulled me along, sitting me on the bench beside 
him 

He gave me a long, exasperated look before he turned to the keys. 

And then his fingers flowed swiftly across the ivory, and the room was filled with a composition so 
complex, so luxuriant, it was impossible to believe only one set of hands played. I felt my chin drop, my 
mouth open in astonishment, and heard low chuckles behind me at my reaction. 

Edward looked at me casually, the music still surging around us without a break, and winked. "Do you 
like it?" 

"You wrote this?" I gasped, understanding. 
He nodded. "It's Esme's favorite." 
I closed my eyes, shaking my head. 
"What's wrong?" 

'Tm feeling extremely insignificant." 

The music slowed, transforming into something softer, and to my surprise I detected the melody of his 
lullaby weaving through the profusion of notes. 

"You inspired this one," he said softly. The music grew unbearably sweet. 
I couldn't speak. 

"They like you, you know," he said conversationally. "Esme especially." 
I glanced behind me, but the huge room was empty now. 
"Where did they go?" 

"Very subtiy giving us some privacy, I suppose." 

I sighed. " They like me. But Rosalie and Emmett. . . " I trailed off, not sure how to express my doubts. 
He frowned. "Don't worry about Rosalie," he said, his eyes wide and persuasive. "She'll come around." 



I pursed my lips skeptically. "Emmett?" 

"Well, he thinks I'm a lunatic, it's true, but he doesn't have a problem with you. He's trying to reason with 
Rosalie." 

"What is it that upsets her?" I wasn't sure if I wanted to know the answer. 

He sighed deeply. "Rosalie struggles the most with. . . with what we are. It's hard for her to have someone 
on the outside know the truth. And she's a little jealous." 

"Rosalie is jealous of me?" I asked incredulously. I tried to imagine a universe in which someone as 
breathtaking as Rosalie would have any possible reason to feel jealous of someone like me. 

"You're human." He shrugged. "She wishes that she were, too." 

"Oh," I muttered, still stunned. "Even Jasper, though. . ." 

"That's really my fault," he said. "I told you he was the most recent to try our way of life. I warned him to 
keep his distance." 

I thought about the reason for that, and shuddered. 

"Esme and Carlisle. . . ?" I continued quickly, to keep him from noticing. 

"Are happy to see me happy. Actually, Esme wouldn't care if you had a third eye and webbed feet. All 
this time she's been worried about me, afraid that there was something missing from my essential makeup, 
that I was too young when Carlisle changed me. . . She's ecstatic. Every time I touch you, she just about 
chokes with satisfaction." 

"Alice seems very. . . enthusiastic." 

"Alice has her own way of looking at things," he said through tight hps. 
"And you're not going to explain that, are you?" 

A moment of wordless communication passed between us. He realized that I knew he was keeping 
something from me. I realized that he wasn't going to give anything away. Not now. 

"So what was Carlisle telling you before?" 

His eyebrows pulled together. "You noticed that, did you?" 

I shrugged. "Of course." 

He looked at me thoughtfully for a few seconds before answering. "He wanted to tell me some news — 
he didn't know if it was something I would share with you." 

"Will you?" 

"I have to, because I'm going to be a little. . . overbearingly protective over the next few days — or 
weeks — and I wouldn't want you to think I'm naturally a tyrant." 

"What's wrong?" 

"Nothing's wrong, exactly. Alice just sees some visitors coming soon. They know we're here, and they're 
curious." 



"Visitors?" 

"Yes. . . well, they aren't like us, of course — in their hunting habits, I mean. They probably won't come 
into town at all, but I'm certainly not going to let you out of my sight till they're gone." 

I shivered. 

"Finally, a rational response!" he murmured. "I was beginning to think you had no sense of 
self-preservation at all." 

I let that one pass, looking away, my eyes wandering again around the spacious room. 
He followed my gaze. "Not what you expected, is it?" he asked, his voice smug. 
"No," I admitted. 

"No coffins, no piled skulls in the comers; I don't even think we have cobwebs. . . what a disappointment 
this must be for you," he continued slyly. 

I ignored his teasing. "It's so light. . . so open." 

He was more serious when he answered. "It's the one place we never have to hide." 

The song he was still playing, my song, drifted to an end, the final chords shifting to a more melancholy 
key. The last note hovered poignantly in the silence. 

"Thank you," I murmured. I realized there were tears in my eyes. I dabbed at them, embarrassed. 

He touched the comer of my eye, trapping one I missed. He lifted his finger, examining the drop of 
moisture broodingly. Then, so quickly I couldn't be positive that he really did, he put his finger to his 
mouth to taste it. 

I looked at him questioningly, and he gazed back for a long moment before he finally smiled. 
"Do you want to see the rest of the house?" 

"No coffins?" I verified, the sarcasm in my voice not entirely masking the slight but genuine anxiety I felt. 
He laughed, taking my hand, leading me away from the piano. 
"No coffins," he promised. 

We walked up the massive staircase, my hand trailing along the satin-smooth rail. The long hall at the top 
of the stairs was paneled with a honey-colored wood, the same as the floorboards. 

"Rosalie and Emmett's room. . . Carlisle's office. . . Alice's room. . . " He gestured as he led me past the 
doors. 

He would have continued, but I stopped dead at the end of the hall, staring incredulously at the ornament 
hanging on the wall above my head. Edward chuckled at my bewildered expression. 

"You can laugh," he said. "It is sort of ironic." 

I didn't laugh. My hand raised automatically, one finger extended as if to touch the large wooden cross, 
its dark patina contrasting with the lighter tone of the wall. I didn't touch it, though I was curious if the 
aged wood would feel as silky as it looked. 



"It must be very old," I guessed. 



He shrugged. "Early sixteen-thirties, more or less." 
I looked away from the cross to stare at him. 
"Why do you keep this here?" I wondered. 
"Nostalgia. It belonged to Carlisle's father." 
"He collected antiques?" I suggested doubtfully. 

"No. He carved this himself. It hung on the wall above the pulpit in the vicarage where he preached." 

I wasn't sure if my face betrayed my shock, but I returned to gazing at the simple, ancient cross, just in 
case. I quickly did the mental math; the cross was over three hundred and seventy years old. The silence 
stretched on as I struggled to wrap my mind around the concept of so many years. 

"Are you all right?" He sounded worried. 

"How old is Carlisle?" I asked quietly, ignoring his question, still staring up. 

"He just celebrated his three hundred and sixty-second birthday," Edward said. I looked back at him, a 
million questions in my eyes. 

He watched me carefully as he spoke. 

"Carlisle was bom in London, in the sixteen-forties, he believes. Time wasn't marked as accurately then, 
for the common people anyway. It was just before Cromwell's rule, though." 

I kept my face composed, aware of his scrutiny as I listened. It was easier if I didn't try to believe. 

"He was the only son of an Anglican pastor. His mother died giving birth to him. His father was an 
intolerant man. As the Protestants came into power, he was enthusiastic in his persecution of Roman 
Catholics and other religions. He also believed very strongly in the reality of evil. He led hunts for 
witches, werewolves. . . and vampires." I grew very still at the word. I'm sure he noticed, but he went on 
without pausing. 

"They burned a lot of innocent people — of course the real creatures that he sought were not so easy to 
catch. 

"When the pastor grew old, he placed his obedient son in charge of the raids. At first Carlisle was a 
disappointment; he was not quick to accuse, to see demons where they did not exist. But he was 
persistent, and more clever than his father. He actually discovered a coven of true vampires that lived 
hidden in the sewers of the city, only corning out by night to hunt. In those days, when monsters were not 
just myths and legends, that was the way many lived. 

"The people gathered their pitchforks and torches, of course" — his brief laugh was darker now — "and 
waited where Carlisle had seen the monsters exit into the street. Eventually one emerged." 

His voice was very quiet; I strained to catch the words. 

"He must have been ancient, and weak with hunger. Carlisle heard him call out in Latin to the others 
when he caught the scent of the mob. He ran through the streets, and Carlisle — he was twenty-three 
and very fast — was in the lead of the pursuit. The creature could have easily outrun them, but Carlisle 



thinks he was too hungry, so he turned and attacked. He fell on Carlisle first, but the others were close 
behind, and he turned to defend himself. He killed two men, and made off with a third, leaving Carlisle 
bleeding in the street." 

He paused. I could sense he was editing something, keeping something from me. 

"Carlisle knew what his father would do. The bodies would be burned — anything infected by the 
monster must be destroyed. Carlisle acted instinctively to save his own life. He crawled away from the 
alley while the mob followed the fiend and his victim. He hid in a cellar, buried himself in rotting potatoes 
for three days. It's a miracle he was able to keep silent, to stay undiscovered. 

"It was over then, and he realized what he had become." 

I'm not sure what my face was revealing, but he suddenly broke off. 

"How are you feeling?" he asked. 

"I'm fine," I assured him. And, though I bit my hp in hesitation, he must have seen the curiosity burning in 
my eyes. 

He smiled. "I expect you have a few more questions for me." 
"A few." 

His smile widened over his brilliant teeth. He started back down the hall, pulling me along by the hand. 
"Come on, then," he encouraged. "I'll show you." 

16. CARLISLE 



He led me back to the room that he'd pointed out as Carlisle's office. He paused outside the door for an 
instant. 

"Come in," Carlisle's voice invited. 

Edward opened the door to a high-ceilinged room with tall, west-facing windows. The walls were 
paneled again, in a darker wood — where they were visible. Most of the wall space was taken up by 
towering bookshelves that reached high above my head and held more books than I'd ever seen outside 
a library. 

Carlisle sat behind a huge mahogany desk in a leather chair. He was just placing a bookmark in the pages 
of the thick volume he held. The room was how I'd always imagined a college dean's would look — only 
Carlisle looked too young to fit the part. 

"What can I do for you?" he asked us pleasantiy, rising from his seat. 

"I wanted to show Bella some of our history," Edward said. "Well, your history, actually." 

"We didn't mean to disturb you," I apologized. 

"Not at all. Where are you going to start?" 

"The Waggoner," Edward replied, placing one hand lightly on my shoulder and spinning me around to 



look back toward the door we'd just come through. Every time he touched me, in even the most casual 
way, my heart had an audible reaction. It was more embarrassing with Carlisle there. 

The wall we faced now was different from the others. Instead of bookshelves, this wall was crowded 
with framed pictures of all sizes, some in vibrant colors, others dull monochromes. I searched for some 
logic, some binding motif the collection had in common, but I found nothing in my hasty examination. 

Edward pulled me toward the far left side, standing me in front of a small square oil painting in a plain 
wooden frame. This one did not stand out among the bigger and brighter pieces; painted in varying tones 
of sepia, it depicted a miniature city full of steeply slanted roofs, with thin spires atop a few scattered 
towers. A wide river filled the foreground, crossed by a bridge covered with structures that looked like 
tiny cathedrals. 

"London in the sixteen-fifties," Edward said. 

"The London of my youth," Carlisle added, from a few feet behind us. I flinched; I hadn't heard him 
approach. Edward squeezed my hand. 

"Will you tell the story?" Edward asked. I twisted a little to see Carlisle's reaction. 

He met my glance and smiled. "I would," he replied. "But I'm actually running a bit late. The hospital 
called this morning — Dr. Snow is taking a sick day. Besides, you know the stories as well as I do," he 
added, grinning at Edward now. 

It was a strange combination to absorb — the everyday concerns of the town doctor stuck in the middle 
of a discussion of his early days in seventeenth-century London. 

It was also unsettling to know that he spoke aloud only for my benefit. 

After another warm smile for me, Carlisle left the room. 

I stared at the little picture of Carlisle's hometown for a long moment. 

"What happened then?" I finally asked, staring up at Edward, who was watching me. "When he realized 
what had happened to him?" 

He glanced back to the paintings, and I looked to see which image caught his interest now. It was a 
larger landscape in dull fall colors — an empty, shadowed meadow in a forest, with a craggy peak in the 
distance. 

"When he knew what he had become," Edward said quietiy, "he rebelled against it. He tried to destroy 
himself. But that's not easily done." 

"How?" I didn't mean to say it aloud, but the word broke through my shock. 

"He jumped from great heights," Edward told me, his voice impassive. "He tried to drown himself in the 
ocean. . . but he was young to the new life, and very strong. It is amazing that he was able to resist. . . 
feeding. . . while he was still so new. The instinct is more powerful then, it takes over everything. But he 
was so repelled by himself that he had the strength to try to kill himself with starvation." 

"Is that possible?" My voice was faint. 

"No, there are very few ways we can be killed." 

I opened my mouth to ask, but he spoke before I could. 



"So he grew very hungry, and eventually weak. He strayed as far as he could from the human populace, 
recognizing that his willpower was weakening, too. For months he wandered by night, seeking the 
loneliest places, loathing himself. 

"One night, a herd of deer passed his hiding place. He was so wild with thirst that he attacked without a 
thought. His strength returned and he realized there was an alternative to being the vile monster he feared. 
Had he not eaten venison in his former life? Over the next months his new philosophy was bom. He 
could exist without being a demon. He found himself again. 

"He began to make better use of his time. He'd always been intelligent, eager to learn. Now he had 
unlimited time before him. He studied by night, planned by day. He swam to France and — " 

"He swam to France?" 

"People swim the Channel all the time, Bella," he reminded me patiently. 
"That's true, I guess. It just sounded funny in that context. Go on." 
"Swirnming is easy for us — " 
"Everything is easy for you" I griped. 
He waited, his expression amused. 
"I won't interrupt again, I promise." 

He chuckled darkly, and finished his sentence. "Because, technically, we don't need to breathe." 
"You—" 

"No, no, you promised." He laughed, putting his cold finger lightiy to my hps. "Do you want to hear the 
story or not?" 

"You can't spring something like that on me, and then expect me not to say anything," I mumbled against 
his finger. 

He lifted his hand, moving it to rest against my neck. The speed of my heart reacted to that, but I 
persisted. 

"You don't have to breathe!" I demanded. 

"No, it's not necessary. Just a habit." He shrugged. 

"How long can you go. . . without breathing?' 

"Indefinitely, I suppose; I don't know. It gets a bit uncomfortable — being without a sense of smell." 
"A bit uncomfortable," I echoed. 

I wasn't paying attention to my own expression, but something in it made him grow somber. His hand 
dropped to his side and he stood very still, his eyes intent on my face. The silence lengthened. His 
features were immobile as stone. 

"What is it?" I whispered, touching his frozen face. 

His face softened under my hand, and he sighed. "I keep waiting for it to happen." 



"For what to happen?" 



"I know that at some point, something I tell you or something you see is going to be too much. And then 
you'll run away from me, screaming as you go." He smiled half a smile, but his eyes were serious. "I won't 
stop you. I want this to happen, because I want you to be safe. And yet, I want to be with you. The two 
desires are impossible to reconcile. . ." He trailed off, staring at my face. Waiting. 

"I'm not mnning anywhere," I promised. 

"We'll see," he said, smiling again. 

I frowned at him. "So, go on — Carlisle was swimming to France." 

He paused, getting back into his story. Reflexively, his eyes flickered to another picture — the most 
colorful of them all, the most ornately framed, and the largest; it was twice as wide as the door it hung 
next to. The canvas overflowed with bright figures in swirling robes, writhing around long pillars and off 
marbled balconies. I couldn't tell if it represented Greek mythology, or if the characters floating in the 
clouds above were meant to be biblical. 

"Carlisle swam to France, and continued on through Europe, to the universities there. By night he studied 
music, science, medicine — and found his calling, his penance, in that, in saving human lives." His 
expression became awed, almost reverent. "I can't adequately describe the struggle; it took Carlisle two 
centuries of torturous effort to perfect his self-control. Now he is all but immune to the scent of human 
blood, and he is able to do the work he loves without agony. He finds a great deal of peace there, at the 
hospital. . ." Edward stared off into space for a long moment. Suddenly he seemed to recall his purpose. 
He tapped his finger against the huge painting in front of us. 

"He was studying in Italy when he discovered the others there. They were much more civilized and 
educated than the wraiths of the London sewers." 

He touched a comparatively sedate quartet of figures painted on the highest balcony, looking down 
calmly on the mayhem below them. I examined the grouping carefully and realized, with a startled laugh, 
that I recognized the golden-haired man. 

"Solimena was greatly inspired by Carlisle's friends. He often painted them as gods," Edward chuckled. 
"Aro, Marcus, Caius," he said, indicating the other three, two black-haired, one snowy-white. "Nighttime 
patrons of the arts." 

"What happened to them?" I wondered aloud, my fingertip hovering a centimeter from the figures on the 
canvas. 

"They're still there." He shrugged. "As they have been for who knows how many millennia. Carlisle 
stayed with them only for a short time, just a few decades. He greatly admired their civility, their 
refinement, but they persisted in trying to cure his aversion to 'his natural food source,' as they called it. 
They tried to persuade him, and he tried to persuade them, to no avail. At that point, Carlisle decided to 
try the New World. He dreamed of finding others like himself. He was very lonely, you see. 

"He didn't find anyone for a long time. But, as monsters became the stuff of fairy tales, he found he could 
interact with unsuspecting humans as if he were one of them. He began practicing medicine. But the 
companionship he craved evaded him; he couldn't risk familiarity. 

"When the influenza epidemic hit, he was working nights in a hospital in Chicago. He'd been turning over 
an idea in his mind for several years, and he had almost decided to act — since he couldn't find a 



companion, he would create one. He wasn't absolutely sure how his own transformation had occurred, 
so he was hesitant. And he was loath to steal anyone's life the way his had been stolen. It was in that 
frame of mind that he found me. There was no hope for me; I was left in a ward with the dying. He had 
nursed my parents, and knew I was alone. He decided to try . . . " 

His voice, nearly a whisper now, trailed off. He stared unseeingly through the west windows. I wondered 
which images filled his mind now, Carlisle's memories or his own. I waited quietly. 

When he turned back to me, a gentle angel's smile lit his expression. 

"And so we've come full circle," he concluded. 

"Have you always stayed with Carlisle, then?" I wondered. 

"Almost always." He put his hand lightiy on my waist and pulled me with him as he walked through the 
door. I stared back at the wall of pictures, wondering if I would ever get to hear the other stories. 

Edward didn't say any more as we walked down the hall, so I asked, "Almost?" 

He sighed, seeming reluctant to answer. "Well, I had a typical bout of rebellious adolescence — about 
ten years after I was. . . bom. . . created, whatever you want to call it. I wasn't sold on his life of 
abstinence, and I resented him for curbing my appetite. So I went off on my own for a time." 

"Really?" I was intrigued, rather than frightened, as I perhaps should have been. 

He could tell. I vaguely realized that we were headed up the next flight of stairs, but I wasn't paying much 
attention to my surroundings. 

"That doesn't repulse you?" 

"No." 

"Why not?" 

"I guess. . . it sounds reasonable." 

He barked a laugh, more loudly than before. We were at the top of the stairs now, in another paneled 
hallway. 

"From the time of my new birth," he murmured, "I had the advantage of knowing what everyone around 
me was thinking, both human and non-human alike. That's why it took me ten years to defy Carlisle — I 
could read his perfect sincerity, understand exactly why he lived the way he did. 

"It took me only a few years to return to Carlisle and recommit to his vision. I thought I would be exempt 
from the. . . depression. . . that accompanies a conscience. Because I knew the thoughts of my prey, I 
could pass over the innocent and pursue only the evil. If I followed a murderer down a dark alley where 
he stalked a young girl — if I saved her, then surely I wasn't so terrible." 

I shivered, imagining only too clearly what he described — the alley at night, the frightened girl, the dark 
man behind her. And Edward, Edward as he hunted, terrible and glorious as a young god, unstoppable. 
Would she have been grateful, that girl, or more frightened than before? 

"But as time went on, I began to see the monster in my eyes. I couldn't escape the debt of so much 
human life taken, no matter how justified. And I went back to Carlisle and Esme. They welcomed me 
back like the prodigal. It was more than I deserved." 



We'd come to a stop in front of the last door in the hall. 

"My room," he informed me, opening it and pulling me through. 

His room faced south, with a wall-sized window like the great room below. The whole back side of the 
house must be glass. His view looked down on the winding Sol Due River, across the untouched forest 
to the Olympic Mountain range. The mountains were much closer than I would have believed. 

The western wall was completely covered with shelf after shelf of CDs. His room was better stocked 
than a music store. In the comer was a sophisticated-looking sound system, the kind I was afraid to 
touch because I'd be sure to break something. There was no bed, only a wide and inviting black leather 
sofa. The floor was covered with a thick golden carpet, and the walls were hung with heavy fabric in a 
slightly darker shade. 

"Good acoustics?" I guessed. 

He chuckled and nodded. 

He picked up a remote and turned the stereo on. It was quiet, but the soft jazz number sounded like the 
band was in the room with us. I went to look at his rnind-boggling music collection. 

"How do you have these organized?" I asked, unable to find any rhyme or reason to the titles. 

He wasn't paying attention. 

"Ummm, by year, and then by personal preference within that frame," he said absentiy. 

I turned, and he was looking at me with a peculiar expression in his eyes. 

"What?" 

"I was prepared to feel. . . relieved. Having you know about everything, not needing to keep secrets from 
you. But I didn't expect to feel more than that. I like it. It makes me. . . happy." He shrugged, smiling 
slightly. 

"I'm glad," I said, smiling back. I'd worried that he might regret telling me these things. It was good to 
know that wasn't the case. 

But then, as his eyes dissected my expression, his smile faded and his forehead creased. 
"You're still waiting for the running and the screaming, aren't you?" I guessed. 
A faint smile touched his lips, and he nodded. 

"I hate to burst your bubble, but you're really not as scary as you think you are. I don't find you scary at 
all, actually," I lied casually. 

He stopped, raising his eyebrows in blatant disbelief. Then he flashed a wide, wicked smile. 
"You really shouldn't have said that," he chuckled. 

He growled, a low sound in the back of his throat; his lips curled back over his perfect teeth. His body 
shifted suddenly, half-crouched, tensed like a lion about to pounce. 

I backed away from him, glaring. 



"You wouldn't." 



I didn't see him leap at me — it was much too fast. I only found myself suddenly airborne, and then we 
crashed onto the sofa, knocking it into the wall. All the while, his arms formed an iron cage of protection 
around me — I was barely jostied. But I still was gasping as I tried to right myself. 

He wasn't having that. He curled me into a ball against his chest, holding me more securely than iron 
chains. I glared at him in alarm, but he seemed well in control, his jaw relaxed as he grinned, his eyes 
bright only with humor. 

"You were saying?" he growled playfully. 

"That you are a very, very terrifying monster," I said, my sarcasm marred a bit by my breathless voice. 

"Much better," he approved. 

"Urn." I struggled. "Can I get up now?" 

He just laughed. 

"Can we come in?" a soft voice sounded from the hall. 

I struggled to free myself, but Edward merely readjusted me so that I was somewhat more conventionally 
seated on his lap. I could see it was Alice, then, and Jasper behind her in the doorway. My cheeks 
burned, but Edward seemed at ease. 

"Go ahead." Edward was still chuckling quietiy. 

Alice seemed to find nothing unusual in our embrace; she walked — almost danced, her movements 
were so graceful — to the center of the room, where she folded herself sinuously onto the floor. Jasper, 
however, paused at the door, his expression a trifle shocked. He stared at Edward's face, and I 
wondered if he was tasting the atmosphere with his unusual sensitivity. 

"It sounded like you were having Bella for lunch, and we came to see if you would share," Alice 
announced. 

I stiffened for an instant, until I realized Edward was grinning — whether at her comment or my response, 
I couldn't tell. 

"Sorry, I don't believe I have enough to spare," he replied, his arms holding me recklessly close. 

"Actually," Jasper said, smiling despite himself as he walked into the room, "Alice says there's going to be 
a real storm tonight, and Emmett wants to play ball. Are you game?" 

The words were all common enough, but the context confused me. I gathered that Alice was a bit more 
reliable than the weatherman, though. 

Edward's eyes lit up, but he hesitated. 

"Of course you should bring Bella," Alice chirped. I thought I saw Jasper throw a quick glance at her. 
"Do you want to go?" Edward asked me, excited, his expression vivid. 
"Sure." I couldn't disappoint such a face. "Urn, where are we going?" 



"We have to wait for thunder to play ball — you'll see why," he promised. 
"Will I need an umbrella?" 
They all three laughed aloud. 
"Will she?" Jasper asked Alice. 

"No." She was positive. "The storm will hit over town. It should be dry enough in the clearing." 

"Good, then." The enthusiasm in Jasper's voice was catching, naturally. I found myself eager, rather than 
scared stiff. 

"Let's go see if Carlisle will come." Alice bounded up and to the door in a fashion that would break any 
ballerina's heart. 

"Like you don't know," Jasper teased, and they were swiftiy on their way. Jasper managed to 
inconspicuously close the door behind them. 

"What will we be playing?" I demanded. 

"You will be watching," Edward clarified. "We will be playing baseball." 

I rolled my eyes. "Vampires like baseball?" 

"It's the American pastime," he said with mock solemnity. 

17. THE GAME 

It was just beginning to drizzle when Edward turned onto my street. Up until that moment, I'd had no 
doubt that he'd be staying with me while I spent a few interim hours in the real world. 

And then I saw the black car, a weathered Ford, parked in Charlie's driveway — and heard Edward 
mutter something unintelligible in a low, harsh voice. 

Leaning away from the rain under the shallow front porch, Jacob Black stood behind his father's 
wheelchair. Billy's face was impassive as stone as Edward parked my truck against the curb. Jacob 
stared down, his expression mortified. 

Edward's low voice was furious. "This is crossing the line." 

"He came to warn Charlie?" I guessed, more horrified than angry. 

Edward just nodded, answering Billy's gaze through the rain with narrowed eyes. 

I felt weak with relief that Charlie wasn't home yet. 

"Let me deal with this," I suggested. Edward's black glare made me anxious. 

To my surprise, he agreed. "That's probably best. Be careful, though. The child has no idea." 

I bridled a little at the word child. "Jacob is not that much younger than I am," I reminded him. 



He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. "Oh, I know," he assured me with a grin. 
I sighed and put my hand on the door handle. 

"Get them inside," he instructed, "so I can leave. I'll be back around dusk." 

"Do you want my truck?" I offered, meanwhile wondering how I would explain its absence to Charlie. 
He rolled his eyes. "I could walk home faster than this truck moves." 
"You don't have to leave," I said wistfully. 

He smiled at my glum expression. "Actually, I do. After you get rid of them" — he threw a dark glance in 
the Blacks' direction — "you still have to prepare Charlie to meet your new boyfriend." He grinned 
widely, showing all of his teeth. 

I groaned. "Thanks a lot." 

He smiled the crooked smile that I loved. "I'll be back soon," he promised. His eyes flickered back to the 
porch, and then he leaned in to swiftly kiss me just under the edge of my jaw. My heart lurched 
frantically, and I, too, glanced toward the porch. Billy's face was no longer impassive, and his hands 
clutched at the armrests of his chair. 

"Soon" I stressed as I opened the door and stepped out into the rain. 

I could feel his eyes on my back as I half-ran through the light sprinkle toward the porch. 

"Hey, Billy. Hi, Jacob." I greeted them as cheerfully as I could manage. "Charlie's gone for the day — I 
hope you haven't been waiting long." 

"Not long," Billy said in a subdued tone. His black eyes were piercing. "I just wanted to bring this up." He 
indicated a brown paper sack resting in his lap. 

"Thanks," I said, though I had no idea what it could be. "Why don't you come in for a minute and dry 

off?" 

I pretended to be oblivious to his intense scrutiny as I unlocked the door, and waved them in ahead of 
me. 

"Here, let me take that," I offered, turning to shut the door. I allowed myself one last glance at Edward. 
He was waiting, perfectiy still, his eyes solemn. 

"You'll want to put it in the fridge," Billy noted as he handed me the package. "It's some of Harry 
Clearwater's homemade fish fry — Charlie's favorite. The fridge keeps it drier." He shrugged. 

"Thanks," I repeated, but with feeling this time. "I was running out of new ways to fix fish, and he's bound 
to bring home more tonight." 

"Fishing again?" Billy asked with a subtie gleam in his eye. "Down at the usual spot? Maybe I'll run by 
and see him." 

"No," I quickly lied, my face going hard. "He was headed someplace new. . . but I have no idea where." 
He took in my changed expression, and it made him thoughtful. 



"Jake," he said, still appraising me. "Why don't you go get that new picture of Rebecca out of the car? I'll 
leave that for Charlie, too." 

"Where is it?" Jacob asked, his voice morose. I glanced at him, but he was staring at the floor, his 
eyebrows pulling together. 

"I think I saw it in the trunk," Billy said. "You may have to dig for it." 
Jacob slouched back out into the rain. 

Billy and I faced each other in silence. After a few seconds, the quiet started to feel awkward, so I turned 
and headed to the kitchen. I could hear his wet wheels squeak against the linoleum as he followed. 

I shoved the bag onto the crowded top shelf of the fridge, and spun around to confront him. His deeply 
lined face was unreadable. 

"Charlie won't be back for a long time." My voice was almost rude. 
He nodded in agreement, but said nothing. 
"Thanks again for the fish fry," I hinted. 

He continued nodding. I sighed and folded my arms across my chest. 

He seemed to sense that I had given up on small talk. "Bella," he said, and then he hesitated. 

I waited. 

"Bella," he said again, "Charlie is one of my best friends." 
"Yes." 

He spoke each word carefully in his rumbling voice. "I noticed you've been spending time with one of the 
Cullens." 

"Yes," I repeated curtly. 

His eyes narrowed. "Maybe it's none of my business, but I don't think that is such a good idea." 
"You're right," I agreed. "It is none of your business." 

He raised his graying eyebrows at my tone. "You probably don't know this, but the Cullen family has an 
unpleasant reputation on the reservation." 

"Actually, I did know that," I informed him in a hard voice. This surprised him. "But that reputation 
couldn't be deserved, could it? Because the Cullens never set foot on the reservation, do they?" I could 
see that my less than subtie reminder of the agreement that both bound and protected his tribe pulled him 
up short. 

"That's true," he acceded, his eyes guarded. "You seem. . . well informed about the Cullens. More 
informed than I expected." 

I stared him down. "Maybe even better informed than you are." 

He pursed his thick hps as he considered that. "Maybe." he allowed, but his eyes were shrewd. "Is 
Charlie as well informed?" 



He had found the weak chink in my armor. 

"Charlie likes the Cullens a lot," I hedged. He clearly understood my evasion. His expression was 
unhappy, but unsurprised. 

"It's not my business," he said. "But it may be Charlie's." 

"Though it would be my business, again, whether or not I think that it's Charlie's business, right?" 

I wondered if he even understood my confused question as I struggled not to say anything compromising. 
But he seemed to. He thought about it while the rain picked up against the roof, the only sound breaking 
the silence. 

"Yes," he finally surrendered. "I guess that's your business, too." 
I sighed with relief. "Thanks, Billy." 
"Just think about what you're doing, Bella," he urged. 
"Okay," I agreed quickly. 

He frowned. "What I meant to say was, don't do what you're doing." 

I looked into his eyes, filled with nothing but concern for me, and there was nothing I could say. 
Just then the front door banged loudly, and I jumped at the sound. 

"There's no picture anywhere in that car." Jacob's complaining voice reached us before he did. The 
shoulders of his shirt were stained with the rain, his hair dripping, when he rounded the comer. 

"Hmm," Billy grunted, suddenly detached, spinning his chair around to face his son. "I guess I left it at 
home." 

Jacob rolled his eyes dramatically. "Great." 

"Well, Bella, tell Charlie" — Billy paused before continuing — "that we stopped by, I mean." 
"I will," I muttered. 

Jacob was surprised. "Are we leaving already?" 

"Charlie's gonna be out late," Billy explained as he rolled himself past Jacob. 
"Oh." Jacob looked disappointed. "Well, I guess I'll see you later, then, Bella." 
"Sure," I agreed. 

"Take care," Billy warned me. I didn't answer. 

Jacob helped his father out the door. I waved briefly, glancing swiftly toward my now-empty truck, and 
then shut the door before they were gone. 

I stood in the hallway for a minute, listening to the sound of their car as it backed out and drove away. I 
stayed where I was, waiting for the irritation and anxiety to subside. When the tension eventually faded a 
bit, I headed upstairs to change out of my dressy clothes. 



I tried on a couple of different tops, not sure what to expect tonight. As I concentrated on what was 
coming, what had just passed became insignificant. Now that I was removed from Jasper's and Edward's 
influence, I began to make up for not being terrified before. I gave up quickly on choosing an outfit — 
throwing on an old flannel shirt and jeans — knowing I would be in my raincoat all night anyway. 

The phone rang and I sprinted downstairs to get it. There was only one voice I wanted to hear; anything 
else would be a disappointment. But I knew that if he wanted to talk to me, he'd probably just 
materialize in my room. 

"Hello?" I asked, breathless. 

"Bella? It's me," Jessica said. 

"Oh, hey, Jess." I scrambled for a moment to come back down to reality. It felt like months rather than 
days since I'd spoken to Jess. "How was the dance?" 

"It was so much fun!" Jessica gushed. Needing no more invitation than that, she launched into a 
minute-by-minute account of the previous night. I mmm'd and ahh'd at the right places, but it wasn't easy 
to concentrate. Jessica, Mike, the dance, the school — they all seemed strangely irrelevant at the 
moment. My eyes kept flashing to the window, trying to judge the degree of light behind the heavy 
clouds. 

"Did you hear what I said, Bella?" Jess asked, irritated. 
"I'm sorry, what?" 

"I said, Mike kissed me! Can you believe it?" 
"That's wonderful, Jess," I said. 

"So what did you do yesterday?" Jessica challenged, still sounding bothered by my lack of attention. Or 
maybe she was upset because I hadn't asked for details. 

"Nothing, really. I just hung around outside to enjoy the sun." 

I heard Charlie's car in the garage. 

"Did you ever hear anything more from Edward Cullen?" 

The front door slammed and I could hear Charlie banging around under the stairs, putting his tackle 
away. 

"Urn." I hesitated, not sure what my story was anymore. 

"Hi there, kiddo!" Charlie called as he walked into the kitchen. I waved at him. 

Jess heard his voice. "Oh, your dad's there. Never mind — we'll talk tomorrow. See you in Trig." 

"See ya, Jess." I hung up the phone. 

"Hey, Dad," I said. He was scrubbing his hands in the sink. "Where's the fish?" 
"I put it out in the freezer." 



"I'll go grab a few pieces before they freeze — Billy dropped off some of Harry Clearwater's fish fry this 



afternoon." I worked to sound enthusiastic. 

"He did?" Charlie's eyes lit up. "That's my favorite." 

Charlie cleaned up while I got dinner ready. It didn't take long till we were sitting at the table, eating in 
silence. Charlie was enjoying his food. I was wondering desperately how to fulfill my assignment, 
struggling to think of a way to broach the subject. 

"What did you do with yourself today?" he asked, snapping me out of my reverie. 

"Well, this afternoon I just hung out around the house. . . " Only the very recent part of this afternoon, 
actually. I tried to keep my voice upbeat, but my stomach was hollow. "And this morning I was over at 
theCullens'." 

Charlie dropped his fork. 

"Dr. Cullen's place?" he asked in astonishment. 

I pretended not to notice his reaction. "Yeah." 

"What were you doing there?" He hadn't picked his fork back up. 

"Well, I sort of have a date with Edward Cullen tonight, and he wanted to introduce me to his parents. . . 
Dad?" 

It appeared that Charlie was having an aneurysm. 
"Dad, are you all right?" 

"You are going out with Edward Cullen?" he thundered. 
Uh-oh. "I thought you liked the Cullens." 
"He's too old for you," he ranted. 

"We're both juniors," I corrected, though he was more right than he dreamed. 
"Wait. . . " He paused. "Which one is Edwin?" 

"Edward is the youngest, the one with the reddish brown hair." The beautiful one, the godlike one. . . 

"Oh, well, that's" — he struggled — "better, I guess. I don't like the look of that big one. I'm sure he's a 
nice boy and all, but he looks too. . . mature for you. Is this Edwin your boyfriend?" 

"It's Edward, Dad." 

"Is he?" 

"Sort of, I guess." 

"You said last night that you weren't interested in any of the boys in town." But he picked up his fork 
again, so I could see the worst was over. 

"Well, Edward doesn't live in town, Dad." 

He gave me a disparaging look as he chewed. 



"And, anyways," I continued, "it's kind of at an early stage, you know. Don't embarrass me with all the 
boyfriend talk, okay?" 

"When is he coming over?" 

"He'll be here in a few minutes." 

"Where is he taking you?" 

I groaned loudly. "I hope you're getting the Spanish Inquisition out of your system now. We're going to 
play baseball with his family." 

His face puckered, and then he finally chuckled. " You're playing baseball?" 

"Well, I'll probably watch most of the time." 

"You must really like this guy," he observed suspiciously. 

I sighed and rolled my eyes for his benefit. 

I heard the roar of an engine pull up in front of the house. I jumped up and started cleaning my dishes. 

"Leave the dishes, I can do them tonight. You baby me too much." 

The doorbell rang, and Charlie stalked off to answer it. I was half a step behind him. 

I hadn't realized how hard it was pouring outside. Edward stood in the halo of the porch light, looking 
like a male model in an advertisement for raincoats. 

"Come on in, Edward." 

I breathed a sigh of relief when Charlie got his name right. 
"Thanks, Chief Swan," Edward said in a respectful voice. 
"Go ahead and call me Charlie. Here, I'll take your jacket." 
"Thanks, sir." 

"Have a seat there, Edward." 
I grimaced. 

Edward sat down fluidly in the only chair, forcing me to sit next to Chief Swan on the sofa. I quickly shot 
him a dirty look. He winked behind Charlie's back. 

"So I hear you're getting my girl to watch baseball." Only in Washington would the fact that it was raining 
buckets have no bearing at all on the playing of outdoor sports. 

"Yes, sir, that's the plan." He didn't look surprised that I'd told my father the truth. He might have been 
listening, though. 

"Well, more power to you, I guess." 
Charlie laughed, and Edward joined in. 



"Okay." I stood up. "Enough humor at my expense. Let's go." I walked back to the hall and pulled on my 
jacket. They followed. 

"Not too late, Bell." 

"Don't worry, Charlie, I'll have her home early," Edward promised. 
"You take care of my girl, all right?" 
I groaned, but they ignored me. 
"She'll be safe with me, I promise, sir." 

Charlie couldn't doubt Edward's sincerity, it rang in every word. 
I stalked out. They both laughed, and Edward followed me. 

I stopped dead on the porch. There, behind my truck, was a monster Jeep. Its tires were higher than my 
waist. There were metal guards over the headlights and tail-lights, and four large spotlights attached to the 
crash bar. The hardtop was shiny red. 

Charlie let out a low whistle. 

"Wear your seat belts," he choked out. 

Edward followed me around to my side and opened the door. I gauged the distance to the seat and 
prepared to jump for it. He sighed, and then lifted me in with one hand. I hoped Charlie didn't notice. 

As he went around to the driver's side, at a normal, human pace, I tried to put on my seat belt. But there 
were too many buckles. 

"What's all this?" I asked when he opened the door. 

"It's an off-roading harness." 

"Uh-oh." 

I tried to find the right places for all the buckles to fit, but it wasn't going too quickly. He sighed again and 
reached over to help me. I was glad that the rain was too heavy to see Charlie clearly on the porch. That 
meant he couldn't see how Edward's hands lingered at my neck, brushed along my collarbones. I gave up 
trying to help him and focused on not hyperventilating. 

Edward turned the key and the engine roared to life. We pulled away from the house. 

"This is a. . . um. . . big Jeep you have." 

"It's Emmett's. I didn't think you'd want to run the whole way." 

"Where do you keep this thing?" 

"We remodeled one of the outbuildings into a garage." 

"Aren't you going to put on your seat belt?" 

He threw me a disbelieving look. 



Then something sunk in. 

"Run the whole way? As in, we're still going to run part of the way?" My voice edged up a few octaves. 

He grinned tightly. "You're not going to run." 

"I'm going to be sick." 

"Keep your eyes closed, you'll be fine." 

I bit my hp, fighting the panic. 

He leaned over to kiss the top of my head, and then groaned. I looked at him, puzzled. 

"You smell so good in the rain," he explained. 

"In a good way, or in a bad way?" I asked cautiously. 

He sighed. "Both, always both." 

I don't know how he found his way in the gloom and downpour, but he somehow found a side road that 
was less of a road and more of a mountain path. For a long while conversation was impossible, because I 
was bouncing up and down on the seat like a jackhammer. He seemed to enjoy the ride, though, smiling 
hugely the whole way. 

And then we came to the end of the road; the trees formed green walls on three sides of the Jeep. The 
rain was a mere drizzle, slowing every second, the sky brighter through the clouds. 

"Sorry, Bella, we have to go on foot from here." 

"You know what? I'll just wait here." 

"What happened to all your courage? You were extraordinary this morning." 
"I haven't forgotten the last time yet." Could it have been only yesterday? 
He was around to my side of the car in a blur. He started unbuckling me. 
"I'll get those, you go on ahead," I protested. 

"Hmmm. . . " he mused as he quickly finished. "It seems I'm going to have to tamper with your memory." 

Before I could react, he pulled me from the Jeep and set my feet on the ground. It was barely misting 
now; Alice was going to be right. 

"Tamper with my memory?" I asked nervously. 

"Something like that." He was watching me intently, carefully, but there was humor deep in his eyes. He 
placed his hands against the Jeep on either side of my head and leaned forward, forcing me to press back 
against the door. He leaned in even closer, his face inches from mine. I had no room to escape. 

"Now," he breathed, and just his smell disturbed my thought processes, "what exactly are you worrying 
about?" 

"Well, um, hitting a tree — " I gulped " — and dying. And then getting sick." 



He fought back a smile. Then he bent his head down and touched his cold hps softly to the hollow at the 
base of my throat. 

"Are you still worried now?" he murmured against my skin. 

"Yes." I struggled to concentrate. "About hitting trees and getting sick." 

His nose drew a line up the skin of my throat to the point of my chin. His cold breath tickled my skin. 
"And now?" His hps whispered against my jaw. 
"Trees," I gasped. "Motion sickness." 

He lifted his face to kiss my eyelids. "Bella, you don't really think I would hit a tree, do you?" 

"No, but / might." There was no confidence in my voice. He smelled an easy victory. 

He kissed slowly down my cheek, stopping just at the comer of my mouth. 

"Would I let a tree hurt you?" His hps barely brushed against my trembhng lower hp. 

"No," I breathed. I knew there was a second part to my brilliant defense, but I couldn't quite call it back. 

"You see," he said, his hps moving against mine. "There's nothing to be afraid of, is there?" 

"No," I sighed, giving up. 

Then he took my face in his hands almost roughly, and kissed me in earnest, his unyielding hps moving 
against mine. 

There really was no excuse for my behavior. Obviously I knew better by now. And yet I couldn't seem 
to stop from reacting exactly as I had the first time. Instead of keeping safely motionless, my arms 
reached up to twine tightly around his neck, and I was suddenly welded to his stone figure. I sighed, and 
my lips parted. 

He staggered back, breaking my grip effortlessly. 

"Damn it, Bella!" he broke off, gasping. "You'll be the death of me, I swear you will." 
I leaned over, bracing my hands against my knees for support. 
"You're indestructible," I mumbled, trying to catch my breath. 

"I might have believed that before I met you . Now let's get out of here before I do something really 
stupid," he growled. 

He threw me across his back as he had before, and I could see the extra effort it took for him to be as 
gentle as he was. I locked my legs around his waist and secured my arms in a choke hold around his 
neck. 

"Don't forget to close your eyes," he warned severely. 

I quickly tucked my face into his shoulder blade, under my own arm, and squeezed my eyes shut. 

And I could hardly tell we were moving. I could feel him gliding along beneath me, but he could have 
been strolling down the sidewalk, the movement was so smooth. I was tempted to peek, just to see if he 



was really flying through the forest like before, but I resisted. It wasn't worth that awful dizziness. I 
contented myself with hstening to his breath come and go evenly. 

I wasn't quite sure we had stopped until he reached back and touched my hair. 

"It's over, Bella." 

I dared to open my eyes, and, sure enough, we were at a standstill. I stiffly unlocked my stranglehold on 
his body and slipped to the ground, landing on my backside. 

"Oh! " I huffed as I hit the wet ground. 

He stared at me incredulously, evidentiy not sure whether he was still too mad to find me funny. But my 
bewildered expression pushed him over the edge, and he broke into a roar of laughter. 

I picked myself up, ignoring him as I brushed the mud and bracken off the back of my jacket. That only 
made him laugh harder. Annoyed, I began to stride off into the forest. 

I felt his arm around my waist. 

"Where are you going, Bella?" 

"To watch a baseball game. You don't seem to be interested in playing anymore, but I'm sure the others 
will have fun without you." 

"You're going the wrong way." 

I turned around without looking at him, and stalked off in the opposite direction. He caught me again. 

"Don't be mad, I couldn't help myself. You should have seen your face." He chuckled before he could 
stop himself. 

"Oh, you're the only one who's allowed to get mad?" I asked, raising my eyebrows. 
"I wasn't mad at you." 

'"Bella, you'll be the death of me'?" I quoted sourly. 

"That was simply a statement of fact." 

I tried to turn away from him again, but he held me fast. 

"You were mad," I insisted. 

"Yes." 

"But you just said — " 

"That I wasn't mad at you. Can't you see that, Bella?" He was suddenly intense, all trace of teasing gone. 
"Don't you understand?" 

"See what?" I demanded, confused by his sudden mood swing as much as his words. 

"I'm never angry with you — how could I be? Brave, trusting. . . warm as you are." 

"Then why?" I whispered, remembering the black moods that pulled him away from me, that I'd always 



interpreted as well-justified frustration — frustration at my weakness, my slowness, my unruly human 
reactions... 

He put his hands carefully on both sides of my face. "I infuriate myself," he said gentiy. "The way I can't 
seem to keep from putting you in danger. My very existence puts you at risk. Sometimes I truly hate 
myself. I should be stronger, I should be able to — " 

I placed my hand over his mouth. "Don't." 

He took my hand, moving it from his hps, but holding it to his face. 

"I love you," he said. "It's a poor excuse for what I'm doing, but it's still true." 

It was the first time he'd said he loved me — in so many words. He might not realize it, but I certainly 
did. 

"Now, please try to behave yourself," he continued, and he bent to softly brush his hps against mine. 
I held properly still. Then I sighed. 

"You promised Chief Swan that you would have me home early, remember? We'd better get going." 
"Yes, ma'am." 

He smiled wistfully and released all of me but one hand. He led me a few feet through the tall, wet ferns 
and draping moss, around a massive hemlock tree, and we were there, on the edge of an enormous open 
field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. It was twice the size of any baseball stadium. 

I could see the others all there; Esme, Emmett, and Rosalie, sitting on a bare outcropping of rock, were 
the closest to us, maybe a hundred yards away. Much farther out I could see Jasper and Alice, at least a 
quarter of a mile apart, appearing to throw something back and forth, but I never saw any ball. It looked 
like Carlisle was marking bases, but could they really be that far apart? 

When we came into view, the three on the rocks rose. 

Esme started toward us. Emmett followed after a long look at Rosalie's back; Rosalie had risen gracefully 
and strode off toward the field without a glance in our direction. My stomach quivered uneasily in 
response. 

"Was that you we heard, Edward?" Esme asked as she approached. 
"It sounded like a bear choking," Emmett clarified. 
I smiled hesitantly at Esme. "That was him." 

"Bella was being unintentionaUy funny," Edward explained, quickly settling the score. 

Alice had left her position and was running, or dancing, toward us. She hurtled to a fluid stop at our feet. 
"It's time," she announced. 

As soon as she spoke, a deep rumble of thunder shook the forest beyond us, and then crashed westward 
toward town. 

"Eerie, isn't it?" Emmett said with easy familiarity, winking at me. 



"Let's go." Alice reached for Emmett's hand and they darted toward the oversized field; she ran like a 
gazelle. He was nearly as graceful and just as fast — yet Emmett could never be compared to a gazelle. 

"Are you ready for some ball?" Edward asked, his eyes eager, bright. 

I tried to sound appropriately enthusiastic. "Go team!" 

He snickered and, after mussing my hair, bounded off after the other two. His run was more aggressive, a 
cheetah rather than a gazelle, and he quickly overtook them. The grace and power took my breath away. 

"Shall we go down?" Esme asked in her soft, melodic voice, and I realized I was staring openmouthed 
after him. I quickly reassembled my expression and nodded. Esme kept a few feet between us, and I 
wondered if she was still being careful not to frighten me. She matched her stride to mine without seeming 
impatient at the pace. 

"You don't play with them?" I asked shyly. 

"No, I prefer to referee — I like keeping them honest," she explained. 
"Do they like to cheat, then?" 

"Oh yes — you should hear the arguments they get into! Actually, I hope you don't, you would think they 
were raised by a pack of wolves." 

"You sound like my mom," I laughed, surprised. 

She laughed, too. "Well, I do think of them as my children in most ways. I never could get over my 
mothering instincts — did Edward tell you I had lost a child?" 

"No," I murmured, stunned, scrambling to understand what lifetime she was remembering. 

"Yes, my first and only baby. He died just a few days after he was bom, the poor tiny thing," she sighed. 
"It broke my heart — that's why I jumped off the cliff, you know," she added matter-of-factly. 

"Edward just said you f-fell," I stammered. 

"Always the gentleman." She smiled. "Edward was the first of my new sons. I've always thought of him 
that way, even though he's older than I, in one way at least." She smiled at me warmly. "That's why I'm 
so happy that he's found you, dear." The endearment sounded very natural on her hps. "He's been the 
odd man out for far too long; it's hurt me to see him alone." 

"You don't mind, then?" I asked, hesitant again. "That I'm. . . all wrong for him?" 

"No." She was thoughtful. "You're what he wants. It will work out, somehow," she said, though her 
forehead creased with worry. Another peal of thunder began. 

Esme stopped then; apparently, we'd reached the edge of the field. It looked as if they had formed 
teams. Edward was far out in left field, Carlisle stood between the first and second bases, and Alice held 
the ball, positioned on the spot that must be the pitcher's mound. 

Emmett was swinging an aluminum bat; it whistled almost untraceably through the air. I waited for him to 
approach home plate, but then I realized, as he took his stance, that he was already there — farther from 
the pitcher's mound than I would have thought possible. Jasper stood several feet behind him, catching 
for the other team. Of course, none of them had gloves. 



"All right," Esme called in a clear voice, which I knew even Edward would hear, as far out as he was. 
"Batter up." 

Alice stood straight, deceptively motionless. Her style seemed to be stealth rather than an intimidating 
windup. She held the ball in both hands at her waist, and then, like the strike of a cobra, her right hand 
flicked out and the ball smacked into Jasper's hand. 

"Was that a strike?" I whispered to Esme. 

"If they don't hit it, it's a strike," she told me. 

Jasper hurled the ball back to Alice's waiting hand. She permitted herself a brief grin. And then her hand 
spun out again. 

This time the bat somehow made it around in time to smash into the invisible ball. The crack of impact 
was shattering, thunderous; it echoed off the mountains — I immediately understood the necessity of the 
thunderstorm. 

The ball shot like a meteor above the field, flying deep into the surrounding forest. 
"Home run," I murmured. 

"Wait," Esme cautioned, Ustening intentiy, one hand raised. Emmett was a blur around the bases, Carlisle 
shadowing him. I realized Edward was missing. 

"Out!" Esme cried in a clear voice. I stared in disbelief as Edward sprang from the fringe of the trees, ball 
in his upraised hand, his wide grin visible even to me. 

"Emmett hits the hardest," Esme explained, "but Edward runs the fastest." 

The inning continued before my incredulous eyes. It was impossible to keep up with the speed at which 
the ball flew, the rate at which their bodies raced around the field. 

I learned the other reason they waited for a thunderstorm to play when Jasper, trying to avoid Edward's 
infallible fielding, hit a ground ball toward Carlisle. Carlisle ran into the ball, and then raced Jasper to first 
base. When they collided, the sound was like the crash of two massive falling boulders. I jumped up in 
concern, but they were somehow unscathed. 

"Safe," Esme called in a calm voice. 

Emmett's team was up by one — Rosalie managed to flit around the bases after tagging up on one of 
Emmett's long flies — when Edward caught the third out. He sprinted to my side, sparkling with 
excitement. 

"What do you think?" he asked. 

"One thing's for sure, I'll never be able to sit through dull old Major League Baseball again." 
"And it sounds like you did so much of that before," he laughed. 
"I am a little disappointed," I teased. 
"Why?" he asked, puzzled. 

"Well, it would be nice if I could find just one thing you didn't do better than everyone else on the planet." 



He flashed his special crooked smile, leaving me breathless. 
"I'm up," he said, heading for the plate. 

He played intelligently, keeping the ball low, out of the reach of Rosalie's always-ready hand in the 
outfield, gaining two bases like lightning before Emmett could get the ball back in play. Carlisle knocked 
one so far out of the field — with a boom that hurt my ears — that he and Edward both made it in. Alice 
slapped them dainty high fives. 

The score constantiy changed as the game continued, and they razzed each other like any street 
ballplayers as they took turns with the lead. Occasionally Esme would call them to order. The thunder 
rumbled on, but we stayed dry, as Alice had predicted. 

Carlisle was up to bat, Edward catching, when Alice suddenly gasped. My eyes were on Edward, as 
usual, and I saw his head snap up to look at her. Their eyes met and something flowed between them in 
an instant. He was at my side before the others could ask Alice what was wrong. 

"Alice?" Esme's voice was tense. 

"I didn't see — I couldn't tell," she whispered. 

All the others were gathered by this time. 

"What is it, Alice?" Carlisle asked with the calm voice of authority. 

"They were traveling much quicker than I thought. I can see I had the perspective wrong before," she 
murmured. 

Jasper leaned over her, his posture protective. "What changed?" he asked. 

"They heard us playing, and it changed their path," she said, contrite, as if she felt responsible for 
whatever had frightened her. 

Seven pairs of quick eyes flashed to my face and away. 
"How soon?" Carlisle said, turning toward Edward. 
A look of intense concentration crossed his face. 

"Less than five minutes. They're running — they want to play." He scowled. 
"Can you make it?" Carlisle asked him, his eyes flicking toward me again. 

"No, not carrying — " He cut short. "Besides, the last thing we need is for them to catch the scent and 
start hunting." 

"How many?" Emmett asked Alice. 
"Three," she answered tersely. 

"Three!" he scoffed. "Let them come." The steel bands of muscle flexed along his massive arms. 

For a split second that seemed much longer than it really was, Carlisle deliberated. Only Emmett seemed 
unperturbed; the rest stared at Carlisle's face with anxious eyes. 

"Let's just continue the game," Carlisle finally decided. His voice was cool and level. "Alice said they 



were simply curious." 

All this was said in a flurry of words that lasted only a few seconds. I had listened carefully and caught 
most of it, though I couldn't hear what Esme now asked Edward with a silent vibration of her lips. I only 
saw the slight shake of his head and the look of relief on her face. 

"You catch, Esme," he said. "I'll call it now." And he planted himself in front of me. 

The others returned to the field, warily sweeping the dark forest with their sharp eyes. Alice and Esme 
seemed to orient themselves around where I stood. 

"Take your hair down," Edward said in a low, even voice. 

I obediently slid the rubber band out of my hair and shook it out around me. 

I stated the obvious. "The others are coming now." 

"Yes, stay very still, keep quiet, and don't move from my side, please." He hid the stress in his voice well, 
but I could hear it. He pulled my long hair forward, around my face. 

"That won't help," Alice said softly. "I could smell her across the field." 

"I know." A hint of frustration colored his tone. 

Carlisle stood at the plate, and the others joined the game halfheartedly. 
"What did Esme ask you?" I whispered. 

He hesitated for a second before he answered. "Whether they were thirsty," he muttered unwillingly. 

The seconds ticked by; the game progressed with apathy now. No one dared to hit harder than a bunt, 
and Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper hovered in the infield. Now and again, despite the fear that numbed my 
brain, I was aware of Rosalie's eyes on me. They were expressionless, but something about the way she 
held her mouth made me think she was angry. 

Edward paid no attention to the game at all, eyes and mind ranging the forest. 

"I'm sorry, Bella," he muttered fiercely. "It was stupid, irresponsible, to expose you like this. I'm so 
sorry." 

I heard his breath stop, and his eyes zeroed in on right field. He took a half step, angling himself between 
me and what was coming. 

Carlisle, Emmett, and the others turned in the same direction, hearing sounds of passage much too faint 
for my ears. 

18. THE HUNT 



They emerged one by one from the forest edge, ranging a dozen meters apart. The first male into the 
clearing fell back immediately, allowing the other male to take the front, orienting himself around the tall, 
dark-haired man in a manner that clearly displayed who led the pack. The third was a woman; from this 
distance, all I could see of her was that her hair was a startling shade of red. 



They closed ranks before they continued cautiously toward Edward's family, exhibiting the natural 
respect of a troop of predators as it encounters a larger, unfamiliar group of its own kind. 

As they approached, I could see how different they were from the Cullens. Their walk was catlike, a gait 
that seemed constantly on the edge of shifting into a crouch. They dressed in the ordinary gear of 
backpackers: jeans and casual button-down shirts in heavy, weatherproof fabrics. The clothes were 
frayed, though, with wear, and they were barefoot. Both men had cropped hair, but the woman's brilliant 
orange hair was filled with leaves and debris from the woods. 

Their sharp eyes carefully took in the more polished, urbane stance of Carlisle, who, flanked by Emmett 
and Jasper, stepped guardedly forward to meet them. Without any seeming communication between 
them, they each straightened into a more casual, erect bearing. 

The man in front was easily the most beautiful, his skin olive-toned beneath the typical pallor, his hair a 
glossy black. He was of a medium build, hard-muscled, of course, but nothing next to Emmett's brawn. 
He smiled an easy smile, exposing a flash of gleaming white teeth. 

The woman was wilder, her eyes shifting restlessly between the men facing her, and the loose grouping 
around me, her chaotic hair quivering in the slight breeze. Her posture was distinctiy feline. The second 
male hovered unobtrusively behind them, slighter than the leader, his light brown hair and regular features 
both nondescript. His eyes, though completely still, somehow seemed the most vigilant. 

Their eyes were different, too. Not the gold or black I had come to expect, but a deep burgundy color 
that was disturbing and sinister. 

The dark-haired man, still smiling, stepped toward Carlisle. 

"We thought we heard a game," he said in a relaxed voice with the slightest of French accents. "I'm 
Laurent, these are Victoria and James." He gestured to the vampires beside him. 

"I'm Carlisle. This is my family, Emmett and Jasper, Rosalie, Esme and Alice, Edward and Bella." He 
pointed us out in groups, deliberately not calling attention to individuals. I felt a shock when he said my 
name. 

"Do you have room for a few more players?" Laurent asked sociably. 

Carlisle matched Laurent's friendly tone. "Actually, we were just finishing up. But we'd certainly be 
interested another time. Are you planning to stay in the area for long?" 

"We're headed north, in fact, but we were curious to see who was in the neighborhood. We haven't run 
into any company in a long time." 

"No, this region is usually empty except for us and the occasional visitor, like yourselves." 

The tense atmosphere had slowly subsided into a casual conversation; I guessed that Jasper was using his 
peculiar gift to control the situation. 

"What's your hunting range?" Laurent casually inquired. 

Carlisle ignored the assumption behind the inquiry. "The Olympic Range here, up and down the Coast 
Ranges on occasion. We keep a permanent residence nearby. There's another permanent settlement like 
ours up near Denali." 

Laurent rocked back on his heels slightly. 



"Permanent? How do you manage that?" There was honest curiosity in his voice. 

"Why don't you come back to our home with us and we can talk comfortably?" Carlisle invited. "It's a 
rather long story." 

James and Victoria exchanged a surprised look at the mention of the word "home," but Laurent 
controlled his expression better. 

"That sounds very interesting, and welcome." His smile was genial. "We've been on the hunt all the way 
down from Ontario, and we haven't had the chance to clean up in a while." His eyes moved 
appreciatively over Carlisle's refined appearance. 

"Please don't take offense, but we'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from hunting in this immediate area. We 
have to stay inconspicuous, you understand," Carlisle explained. 

"Of course." Laurent nodded. "We certainly won't encroach on your territory. We just ate outside of 
Seattle, anyway," he laughed. A shiver ran up my spine. 

"We'll show you the way if you'd like to run with us — Emmett and Alice, you can go with Edward and 
Bella to get the Jeep," he casually added. 

Three things seemed to happen simultaneously while Carlisle was speaking. My hair ruffled with the light 
breeze, Edward stiffened, and the second male, James, suddenly whipped his head around, scrutinizing 
me, his nostrils flaring. 

A swift rigidity fell on all of them as James lurched one step forward into a crouch. Edward bared his 
teeth, crouching in defense, a feral snarl ripping from his throat. 

It was nothing like the playful sounds I'd heard from him this morning; it was the single most menacing 
thing I had ever heard, and chills ran from the crown of my head to the back of my heels. 

"What's this?" Laurent exclaimed in open surprise. Neither James nor Edward relaxed their aggressive 
poses. James feinted slightly to the side, and Edward shifted in response. 

"She's with us." Carlisle's firm rebuff was directed toward James. Laurent seemed to catch my scent less 
powerfully than James, but awareness now dawned on his face. 

"You brought a snack?" he asked, his expression incredulous as he took an involuntary step forward. 

Edward snarled even more ferociously, harshly, his Up curling high above his glistening, bared teeth. 
Laurent stepped back again. 

"I said she's with us," Carlisle corrected in a hard voice. 

"But she's human" Laurent protested. The words were not at all aggressive, merely astounded. 

"Yes." Emmett was very much in evidence at Carlisle's side, his eyes on James. James slowly 
straightened out of his crouch, but his eyes never left me, his nostrils still wide. Edward stayed tensed like 
a lion in front of me. 

When Laurent spoke, his tone was soothing — trying to defuse the sudden hostility. "It appears we have 
a lot to learn about each other." 

"Indeed." Carlisle's voice was still cool. 



"But we'd like to accept your invitation." His eyes flicked toward me and back to Carlisle. "And, of 
course, we will not harm the human girl. We won't hunt in your range, as I said." 

James glanced in disbelief and aggravation at Laurent and exchanged another brief look with Victoria, 
whose eyes still flickered edgily from face to face. 

Carlisle measured Laurent's open expression for a moment before he spoke. "We'll show you the way. 
Jasper, Rosalie, Esme?" he called. They gathered together, blocking me from view as they converged. 
Alice was instantly at my side, and Emmett fell back slowly, his eyes locked on James as he backed 
toward us. 

"Let's go, Bella." Edward's voice was low and bleak. 

This whole time I'd been rooted in place, terrified into absolute immobility. Edward had to grip my elbow 
and pull sharply to break my trance. Alice and Emmett were close behind us, hiding me. I stumbled 
alongside Edward, still stunned with fear. I couldn't hear if the main group had left yet. Edward's 
impatience was almost tangible as we moved at human speed to the forest edge. 

Once we were into the trees, Edward slung me over his back without breaking stride. I gripped as tightly 
as possible as he took off, the others close on his heels. I kept my head down, but my eyes, wide with 
fright, wouldn't close. They plunged through the now-black forest like wraiths. The sense of exhilaration 
that usually seemed to possess Edward as he ran was completely absent, replaced by a fury that 
consumed him and drove him still faster. Even with me on his back, the others trailed behind. 

We reached the Jeep in an impossibly short time, and Edward barely slowed as he flung me in the 
backseat. 

"Strap her in," he ordered Emmett, who slid in beside me. 

Alice was already in the front seat, and Edward was starting the engine. It roared to life and we swerved 
backward, spinning around to face the winding road. 

Edward was growling something too fast for me to understand, but it sounded a lot like a string of 
profanities. 

The jolting trip was much worse this time, and the darkness only made it more frightening. Emmett and 
Alice both glared out the side windows. 

We hit the main road, and though our speed increased, I could see much better where we were going. 
And we were headed south, away from Forks. 

"Where are we going?" I asked. 

No one answered. No one even looked at me. 

"Dammit, Edward! Where are you taking me?" 

"We have to get you away from here — far away — now." He didn't look back, his eyes on the road. 
The speedometer read a hundred and five miles an hour. 

"Turn around! You have to take me home!" I shouted. I struggled with the stupid harness, tearing at the 
straps. 

"Emmett," Edward said grimly. 



And Emmett secured my hands in his steely grasp. 
"No! Edward! No, you can't do this." 
"I have to, Bella, now please be quiet." 

"I won't! You have to take me back — Charlie will call the FBI! They'll be all over your family — 
Carlisle and Esme! They'll have to leave, to hide forever!" 

"Calm down, Bella." His voice was cold. "We've been there before." 

"Not over me, you don't! You're not mining everything over me!" I struggled violentiy, with total futility. 
Alice spoke for the first time. "Edward, pull over." 
He flashed her a hard look, and then sped up. 
"Edward, let's just talk this through." 

"You don't understand," he roared in frustration. I'd never heard his voice so loud; it was deafening in the 
confines of the Jeep. The speedometer neared one hundred and fifteen. "He's a tracker, Alice, did you 
see that? He's a tracker!" 

I felt Emmett stiffen next to me, and I wondered at his reaction to the word. It meant something more to 
the three of them than it did to me; I wanted to understand, but there was no opening for me to ask. 

"Pull over, Edward." Alice's tone was reasonable, but there was a ring of authority in it I'd never heard 
before. 

The speedometer inched passed one-twenty. 
"Do it, Edward." 

"Listen to me, Alice. I saw his mind. Tracking is his passion, his obsession — and he wants her, Alice — 
her, specifically. He begins the hunt tonight." 

"He doesn't know where — " 

He interrupted her. "How long do you think it will take him to cross her scent in town? His plan was 
already set before the words were out of Laurent's mouth." 

I gasped, knowing where my scent would lead. "Charlie! You can't leave him there! You can't leave 
him!" I thrashed against the harness. 

"She's right," Alice said. 

The car slowed slightiy. 

"Let's just look at our options for a minute," Alice coaxed. 

The car slowed again, more noticeably, and then suddenly we screeched to a stop on the shoulder of the 
highway. I flew against the harness, and then slammed back into the seat. 

"There are no options," Edward hissed. 

"I'm not leaving Charlie!" I yelled. 



He ignored me completely. 

"We have to take her back," Emmett finally spoke. 

"No." Edward was absolute. 

"He's no match for us, Edward. He won't be able to touch her." 
"He'll wait." 

Emmett smiled. "I can wait, too." 

"You didn't see — you don't understand. Once he commits to a hunt, he's unshakable. We'd have to kill 
him" 

Emmett didn't seem upset by the idea. "That's an option." 

"And the female. She's with him. If it turns into a fight, the leader will go with them, too." 

"There are enough of us." 

"There's another option," Alice said quietiy. 

Edward turned on her in fury, his voice a blistering snarl. "There — is — no — other — option!" 

Emmett and I both stared at him in shock, but Alice seemed unsurprised. The silence lasted for a long 
minute as Edward and Alice stared each other down. 

I broke it. "Does anyone want to hear my plan?" 

"No," Edward growled. Alice glared at him, finally provoked. 

"Listen," I pleaded. "You take me back." 

"No," he interrupted. 

I glared at him and continued. "You take me back. I tell my dad I want to go home to Phoenix. I pack 
my bags. We wait till this tracker is watching, and then we run. He'll follow us and leave Charlie alone. 
Charlie won't call the FBI on your family. Then you can take me any damned place you want." 

They stared at me, stunned. 

"It's not a bad idea, really." Emmett's surprise was definitely an insult. 

"It might work — and we simply can't leave her father unprotected. You know that," Alice said. 
Everyone looked at Edward. 

"It's too dangerous — I don't want him within a hundred miles of her." 

Emmett was supremely confident. "Edward, he's not getting through us." 

Alice thought for a minute. "I don't see him attacking. He'll try to wait for us to leave her alone." 

"It won't take long for him to realize that's not going to happen." 

"I demand that you take me home." I tried to sound firm. 



Edward pressed his fingers to his temples and squeezed his eyes shut. 

"Please," I said in a much smaller voice. 

He didn't look up. When he spoke, his voice sounded worn. 

"You're leaving tonight, whether the tracker sees or not. You tell Charlie that you can't stand another 
minute in Forks. Tell him whatever story works. Pack the first things your hands touch, and then get in 
your truck. I don't care what he says to you. You have fifteen minutes. Do you hear me? Fifteen minutes 
from the time you cross the doorstep." 

The Jeep rumbled to life, and he spun us around, the tires squealing. The needle on the speedometer 
started to race up the dial. 

"Emmett?" I asked, looking pointedly at my hands. 

"Oh, sorry." He let me loose. 

A few minutes passed in silence, other than the roar of the engine. Then Edward spoke again. 

"This is how it's going to happen. When we get to the house, if the tracker is not there, I will walk her to 
the door. Then she has fifteen minutes." He glared at me in the rearview mirror. "Emmett, you take the 
outside of the house. Alice, you get the truck. I'll be inside as long as she is. After she's out, you two can 
take the Jeep home and tell Carlisle." 

"No way," Emmett broke in. "I'm with you." 

"Think it through, Emmett. I don't know how long I'll be gone." 

"Until we know how far this is going to go, I'm with you." 

Edward sighed. "If the tracker is there," he continued grimly, "we keep driving." 

"We're going to make it there before him," Alice said confidently. 

Edward seemed to accept that. Whatever his problem with Alice was, he didn't doubt her now. 

"What are we going to do with the Jeep?" she asked. 

His voice had a hard edge. "You're driving it home." 

"No, I'm not," she said calmly. 

The unintelligible stream of profanities started again. 

"We can't all fit in my truck," I whispered. 

Edward didn't appear to hear me. 

"I think you should let me go alone," I said even more quietiy. 
He heard that. 

"Bella, please just do this my way, just this once," he said between clenched teeth. 

"Listen, Charlie's not an imbecile," I protested. "If you're not in town tomorrow, he's going to get 



suspicious." 

"That's irrelevant. We'll make sure he's safe, and that's all that matters." 

"Then what about this tracker? He saw the way you acted tonight. He's going to think you're with me, 
wherever you are." 

Emmett looked at me, insultingly surprised again. "Edward, listen to her," he urged. "I think she's right." 

"Yes, she is," Alice agreed. 

"I can't do that." Edward's voice was icy. 

"Emmett should stay, too," I continued. "He definitely got an eyeful of Emmett." 
"What?" Emmett turned on me. 

"You'll get a better crack at him if you stay," Alice agreed. 

Edward stared at her incredulously. "You think I should let her go alone?" 

"Of course not," Alice said. "Jasper and I will take her." 

"I can't do that," Edward repeated, but this time there was a trace of defeat in his voice. The logic was 
working on him. 

I tried to be persuasive. "Hang out here for a week — " I saw his expression in the mirror and amended 
" — a few days. Let Charlie see you haven't kidnapped me, and lead this James on a wild-goose chase. 
Make sure he's completely off my trail. Then come and meet me. Take a roundabout route, of course, 
and then Jasper and Alice can go home." 

I could see him beginning to consider it. 

"Meet you where?" 

"Phoenix." Of course. 

"No. He'll hear that's where you're going," he said impatientiy. 

"And you'll make it look like that's a ruse, obviously. He'll know that we'll know that he's listening. He'll 
never believe I'm actually going where I say I am going." 

"She's diabolical," Emmett chuckled. 

"And if that doesn't work?" 

"There are several million people in Phoenix," I informed him. 
"It's not that hard to find a phone book." 
"I won't go home." 

"Oh?" he inquired, a dangerous note in his voice. 
"I'm quite old enough to get my own place." 



"Edward, we'll be with her," Alice reminded him. 

"What are you going to do in Phoenix?' he asked her scathingly. 

"Stay indoors." 

"I kind of like it." Emmett was tliinking about cornering James, no doubt. 
"Shutup,Emmett." 

"Look, if we try to take him down while she's still around, there's a much better chance that someone 
will get hurt — she'll get hurt, or you will, trying to protect her. Now, if we get him alone. . . " He trailed 
off with a slow smile. I was right. 

The Jeep was crawling slowly along now as we drove into town. Despite my brave talk, I could feel the 
hairs on my arms standing up. I thought about Charlie, alone in the house, and tried to be courageous. 

"Bella." Edward's voice was very soft. Alice and Emmett looked out their windows. "If you let anything 
happen to yourself — anything at all — I'm holding you personally responsible. Do you understand that?" 

"Yes," I gulped. 

He turned to Alice. 

"Can Jasper handle this?" 

"Give him some credit, Edward. He's been doing very, very well, all things considered." 
"Can you handle this?" he asked. 

And graceful little Alice pulled back her lips in a horrific grimace and let loose with a guttural snarl that 
had me cowering against the seat in terror. 

Edward smiled at her. "But keep your opinions to yourself," he muttered suddenly. 
19. GOODBYES 

Charlie was waiting up for me. All the house lights were on. My mind was blank as I tried to think of a 
way to make him let me go. This wasn't going to be pleasant. 

Edward pulled up slowly, staying well back from my truck. All three of them were acutely alert, ramrod 
straight in their seats, listening to every sound of the wood, looking through every shadow, catching every 
scent, searching for something out of place. The engine cut off, and I sat, motionless, as they continued to 
listen. 

"He's not here," Edward said tensely. "Let's go." Emmett reached over to help me get out of the harness. 

"Don't worry, Bella," he said in a low but cheerful voice, "we'll take care of things here quickly." 

I felt moisture filling up my eyes as I looked at Emmett. I barely knew him, and yet, somehow, not 
knowing when I would see him again after tonight was anguishing. I knew this was just a faint taste of the 
goodbyes I would have to survive in the next hour, and the thought made the tears begin to spill. 



"Alice, Emmett." Edward's voice was a command. They slithered soundlessly into the darkness, instantly 
disappearing. Edward opened my door and took my hand, then drew me into the protecting enclosure of 
his arm. He walked me swiftly toward the house, eyes always roving through the night. 

"Fifteen minutes," he warned under his breath. 

"I can do this." I sniffled. My tears had given me an inspiration. 

I stopped on the porch and took hold of his face in my hands. I looked fiercely into his eyes. 
"I love you," I said in a low, intense voice. "I will always love you, no matter what happens now." 
"Nothing is going to happen to you, Bella," he said just as fiercely. 

"Just follow the plan, okay? Keep Charlie safe for me. He's not going to like me very much after this, and 
I want to have the chance to apologize later." 

"Get inside, Bella. We have to hurry." His voice was urgent. 

"One more thing," I whispered passionately. "Don't listen to another word I say tonight!" He was leaning 
in, and so all I had to do was stretch up on my toes to kiss his surprised, frozen lips with as much force 
as I was capable of. Then I turned and kicked the door open. 

"Go away, Edward!" I yelled at him, running inside and slamming the door shut in his still-shocked face. 

"Bella?" Charlie had been hovering in the living room, and he was already on his feet. 

"Leave me alone!" I screamed at him through my tears, which were flowing relentlessly now. I ran up the 
stairs to my room, throwing the door shut and locking it. I ran to my bed, flinging myself on the floor to 
retrieve my duffel bag. I reached swiftly between the mattress and box spring to grab the knotted old 
sock that contained my secret cash hoard. 

Charlie was pounding on my door. 

"Bella, are you okay? What's going on?" His voice was frightened. 
'Tm going borne" I shouted, my voice breaking in the perfect spot. 
"Did he hurt you?" His tone edged toward anger. 

"No!" I shrieked a few octaves higher. I turned to my dresser, and Edward was already there, silently 
yanking out armfuls of random clothes, which he proceeded to throw to me. 

"Did he break up with you?" Charlie was perplexed. 

"No!" I yelled, slightiy more breathless as I shoved everything into the bag. Edward threw another 
drawer's contents at me. The bag was pretty much full now. 

"What happened, Bella?" Charlie shouted through the door, pounding again. 

"/broke up with him\" I shouted back, jerking on the zipper of my bag. Edward's capable hands pushed 
mine away and zipped it smoothly. He put the strap carefully over my arm. 

"I'll be in the truck — go!" he whispered, and pushed me toward the door. He vanished out the window. 
I unlocked the door and pushed past Charlie roughly, struggling with my heavy bag as I ran down the 



stairs. 



"What happened?" he yelled. He was right behind me. "I thought you liked him." 

He caught my elbow in the kitchen. Though he was still bewildered, his grip was firm. 

He spun me around to look at him, and I could see in his face that he had no intention of letting me leave. 
I could think of only one way to escape, and it involved hurting him so much that I hated myself for even 
considering it. But I had no time, and I had to keep him safe. 

I glared up at my father, fresh tears in my eyes for what I was about to do. 

"I do like him — that's the problem. I can't do this anymore! I can't put down any more roots here! I 
don't want to end up trapped in this stupid, boring town like Mom! I'm not going to make the same dumb 
mistake she did. I hate it — I can't stay here another minute!" 

His hand dropped from my arm like I'd electrocuted him. I turned away from his shocked, wounded face 
and headed for the door. 

"Bells, you can't leave now. It's nighttime," he whispered behind me. 
I didn't turn around. "I'll sleep in the truck if I get tired." 

"Just wait another week," he pled, still shell-shocked. "Renee will be back by then." 
This completely derailed me. "What?" 

Charlie continued eagerly, almost babbling with relief as I hesitated. "She called while you were out. 
Things aren't going so well in Florida, and if Phil doesn't get signed by the end of the week, they're going 
back to Arizona. The assistant coach of the Sidewinders said they might have a spot for another 
shortstop." 

I shook my head, trying to reassemble my now-confused thoughts. Every passing second put Charlie in 
more danger. 

"I have a key," I muttered, turning the knob. He was too close, one hand extended toward me, his face 
dazed. I couldn't lose any more time arguing with him. I was going to have to hurt him further. 

"Just let me go, Charlie." I repeated my mother's last words as she'd walked out this same door so many 
years ago. I said them as angrily as I could manage, and I threw the door open. "It didn't work out, 
okay? I really, really hate Forks !" 

My cruel words did their job — Charlie stayed frozen on the doorstep, stunned, while I ran into the 
night. I was hideously frightened of the empty yard. I ran wildly for the truck, visualizing a dark shadow 
behind me. I threw my bag in the bed and wrenched the door open. The key was waiting in the ignition. 

"I'll call you tomorrow ! " I yelled, wishing more than anything that I could explain everything to him right 
then, knowing I would never be able to. I gunned the engine and peeled out. 

Edward reached for my hand. 

"Pull over," he said as the house, and Charlie, disappeared behind us. 
"I can drive," I said through the tears pouring down my cheeks. 



His long hands unexpectedly gripped my waist, and his foot pushed mine off the gas pedal. He pulled me 
across his lap, wrenching my hands free of the wheel, and suddenly he was in the driver's seat. The truck 
didn't swerve an inch. 

"You wouldn't be able to find the house," he explained. 

Lights flared suddenly behind us. I stared out the back window, eyes wide with horror. 

"It's just Alice," he reassured me. He took my hand again. 

My mind was filled with the image of Charlie in the doorway. "The tracker?" 

"He heard the end of your performance," Edward said grimly. 

"Charlie?" I asked in dread. 

"The tracker followed us. He's running behind us now." 
My body went cold. 
"Can we outrun him?" 

"No." But he sped up as he spoke. The truck's engine whined in protest. 
My plan suddenly didn't feel so brilliant anymore. 

I was staring back at Alice's headlights when the truck shuddered and a dark shadow sprung up outside 
the window. 

My bloodcurdling scream lasted a fraction of a second before Edward's hand clamped down on my 
mouth. 

"It'sEmmett!" 

He released my mouth, and wound his arm around my waist. 
"It's okay, Bella," he promised. "You're going to be safe." 
We raced through the quiet town toward the north highway. 

"I didn't realize you were still so bored with small-town life," he said conversationally, and I knew he was 
trying to distract me. "It seemed like you were adjusting fairly well — especially recently. Maybe I was 
just flattering myself that I was making life more interesting for you." 

"I wasn't being nice," I confessed, ignoring his attempt at diversion, looking down at my knees. "That was 
the same thing my mom said when she left him. You could say I was hitting below the belt." 

"Don't worry. He'll forgive you." He smiled a little, though it didn't touch his eyes. 

I stared at him desperately, and he saw the naked panic in my eyes. 

"Bella, it's going to be all right." 

"But it won't be all right when I'm not with you," I whispered. 

"We'll be together again in a few days," he said, tightening his arm around me. "Don't forget that this was 



your idea." 



"It was the best idea — of course it was mine." 

His answering smile was bleak and disappeared immediately. 

"Why did this happen?" I asked, my voice catching. "Why me?" 

He stared blackly at the road ahead. "It's my fault — I was a fool to expose you like that." The rage in 
his voice was directed internally. 

"That's not what I meant," I insisted. "I was there, big deal. It didn't bother the other two. Why did this 
James decide to kill met There're people all over the place, why me?" 

He hesitated, thinking before he answered. 

"I got a good look at his mind tonight," he began in a low voice. "I'm not sure if there's anything I could 
have done to avoid this, once he saw you. It is partially your fault." His voice was wry. "If you didn't 
smell so appallingly luscious, he might not have bothered. But when I defended you. . . well, that made it a 
lot worse. He's not used to being thwarted, no matter how insignificant the object. He thinks of himself as 
a hunter and nothing else. His existence is consumed with tracking, and a challenge is all he asks of life. 
Suddenly we've presented him with a beautiful challenge — a large clan of strong fighters all bent on 
protecting the one vulnerable element. You wouldn't believe how euphoric he is now. It's his favorite 
game, and we've just made it his most exciting game ever." His tone was full of disgust. 

He paused a moment. 

"But if I had stood by, he would have killed you right then," he said with hopeless frustration. 

"I thought. . . I didn't smell the same to the others. .. as I do to you," I said hesitantly. 

"You don't. But that doesn't mean that you aren't still a temptation to every one of them. If you had 
appealed to the tracker — or any of them — the same way you appeal to me, it would have meant a 
fight right there." 

I shuddered. 

"I don't think I have any choice but to kill him now," he muttered. "Carlisle won't like it." 

I could hear the tires cross the bridge, though I couldn't see the river in the dark. I knew we were getting 
close. I had to ask him now. 

"How can you kill a vampire?" 

He glanced at me with unreadable eyes and his voice was suddenly harsh. "The only way to be sure is to 
tear him to shreds, and then burn the pieces." 

"And the other two will fight with him?" 

"The woman will. I'm not sure about Laurent. They don't have a very strong bond — he's only with them 
for convenience. He was embarrassed by James in the meadow. . . " 

"But James and the woman — they'll try to kill you?" I asked, my voice raw. 

"Bella, don't you dare waste time worrying about me. Your only concern is keeping yourself safe and — 



please, please — trying not to be reckless." 
"Is he still Mowing?" 

"Yes. He won't attack the house, though. Not tonight." 

He turned off onto the invisible drive, with Alice following behind. 

We drove right up to the house. The lights inside were bright, but they did little to alleviate the blackness 
of the encroaching forest. Emmett had my door open before the truck was stopped; he pulled me out of 
the seat, tucked me like a football into his vast chest, and ran me through the door. 

We burst into the large white room, Edward and Alice at our sides. All of them were there; they were 
already on their feet at the sound of our approach. Laurent stood in their midst. I could hear low growls 
rumble deep in Emmett's throat as he set me down next to Edward. 

"He's tracking us," Edward announced, glaring balefully at Laurent. 

Laurent's face was unhappy. "I was afraid of that." 

Alice danced to Jasper's side and whispered in his ear; her lips quivered with the speed of her silent 
speech. They flew up the stairs together. Rosalie watched them, and then moved quickly to Emmett's 
side. Her beautiful eyes were intense and — when they flickered unwillingly to my face — furious. 

"What will he do?" Carlisle asked Laurent in chilling tones. 

"I'm sorry," he answered. "I was afraid, when your boy there defended her, that it would set him off." 
"Can you stop him?" 

Laurent shook his head. "Nothing stops James when he gets started." 
"We'll stop him," Emmett promised. There was no doubt what he meant. 

"You can't bring him down. I've never seen anything like him in my three hundred years. He's absolutely 
lethal. That's why I joined his coven." 

His coven, I thought, of course. The show of leadership in the clearing was merely that, a show. 

Laurent was shaking his head. He glanced at me, perplexed, and back to Carlisle. "Are you sure it's 
worth it?" 

Edward's enraged roar filled the room; Laurent cringed back. 

Carlisle looked gravely at Laurent. "I'm afraid you're going to have to make a choice." 

Laurent understood. He deliberated for a moment. His eyes took in every face, and finally swept the 
bright room. 

"I'm intrigued by the life you've created here. But I won't get in the middle of this. I bear none of you any 
enmity, but I won't go up against James. I think I will head north — to that clan in Denali." He hesitated. 
"Don't underestimate James. He's got a brilliant mind and unparalleled senses. He's every bit as 
comfortable in the human world as you seem to be, and he won't come at you head on. . . I'm sorry for 
what's been unleashed here. Truly sorry." He bowed his head, but I saw him flicker another puzzled look 
at me. 



"Go in peace," was Carlisle's formal answer. 

Laurent took another long look around himself, and then he hurried out the door. 
The silence lasted less than a second. 
"How close?" Carlisle looked to Edward. 

Esme was already moving; her hand touched an inconspicuous keypad on the wall, and with a groan, 
huge metal shutters began sealing up the glass wall. I gaped. 

"About three miles out past the river; he's circling around to meet up with the female." 
"What's the plan?" 

"We'll lead him off, and then Jasper and Alice will run her south." 
"And then?" 

Edward's tone was deadly. "As soon as Bella is clear, we hunt him." 
"I guess there's no other choice," Carlisle agreed, his face grim. 
Edward turned to Rosalie. 

"Get her upstairs and trade clothes," Edward commanded. She stared back at him with livid disbelief. 

"Why should I?" she hissed. "What is she to me? Except a menace — a danger you've chosen to inflict 
on all of us." 

I flinched back from the venom in her voice. 

"Rose. . . " Emmett murmured, putting one hand on her shoulder. She shook it off. 

But I was watching Edward carefully, knowing his temper, worried about his reaction. 

He surprised me. He looked away from Rosalie as if she hadn't spoken, as if she didn't exist. 

"Esme?" he asked calmly. 

"Of course," Esme murmured. 

Esme was at my side in half a heartbeat, swinging me up easily into her arms, and dashing up the stairs 
before I could gasp in shock. 

"What are we doing?" I asked breathlessly as she set me down in a dark room somewhere off the 
second-story hall. 

"Trying to confuse the smell. It won't work for long, but it might help get you out." I could hear her 
clothes falling to the floor. 

"I don't think I'll fit. . . " I hesitated, but her hands were abruptly pulling my shirt over my head. I quickly 
stripped my jeans off myself. She handed me something, it felt like a shirt. I struggled to get my arms 
through the right holes. As soon as I was done she handed me her slacks. I yanked them on, but I 
couldn't get my feet out; they were too long. She deftly rolled the hems a few times so I could stand. 
Somehow she was already in my clothes. She pulled me back to the stairs, where Alice stood, a small 



leather bag in one hand. They each grabbed one of my elbows and half -carried me as they flew down the 
stairs. 

It appeared that everything had been settled downstairs in our absence. Edward and Emmett were ready 
to leave, Emmett carrying a heavy-looking backpack over his shoulder. Carlisle was handing something 
small to Esme. He turned and handed Alice the same thing — it was a tiny silver cell phone. 

'Esme and Rosalie will be taking your truck, Bella," he told me as he passed. I nodded, glancing warily at 
Rosalie. She was glowering at Carlisle with a resentful expression. 

"Alice, Jasper — take the Mercedes. You'll need the dark tint in the south." 

They nodded as well. 

"We're taking the Jeep." 

I was surprised to see that Carlisle intended to go with Edward. I realized suddenly, with a stab of fear, 
that they made up the hunting party. 

"Alice," Carlisle asked, "will they take the bait?" 

Everyone watched Alice as she closed her eyes and became incredibly still. 

Finally her eyes opened. "He'll track you. The woman will follow the truck. We should be able to leave 
after that." Her voice was certain. 

"Let's go." Carlisle began to walk toward the kitchen. 

But Edward was at my side at once. He caught me up in his iron grip, crushing me to him. He seemed 
unaware of his watching family as he pulled my face to his, lifting my feet off the floor. For the shortest 
second, his hps were icy and hard against mine. Then it was over. He set me down, still holding my face, 
his glorious eyes burning into mine. 

His eyes went blank, curiously dead, as he turned away. 

And they were gone. 

We stood there, the others looking away from me as the tears streaked noiselessly down my face. 

The silent moment dragged on, and then Esme's phone vibrated in her hand. It flashed to her ear. 

"Now," she said. Rosalie stalked out the front door without another glance in my direction, but Esme 
touched my cheek as she passed. 

"Be safe." Her whisper lingered behind them as they slipped out the door. I heard my truck start 
thunderously, and then fade away. 

Jasper and Alice waited. Alice's phone seemed to be at her ear before it buzzed. 

"Edward says the woman is on Esme's trail. I'll get the car." She vanished into the shadows the way 
Edward had gone. 

Jasper and I looked at each other. He stood across the length of the entry way from me. . . being careful. 
"You're wrong, you know," he said quietiy. 



"What?" I gasped. 

"I can feel what you're feeling now — and you are worth it." 

"I'm not," I mumbled. "If anything happens to them, it will be for nothing." 

"You're wrong," he repeated, smiling kindly at me. 

I heard nothing, but then Alice stepped through the front door and came toward me with her arms held 
out. 

"May I?" she asked. 

"You're the first one to ask permission." I smiled wryly. 

She lifted me in her slender arms as easily as Emmett had, shielding me protectively, and then we flew out 
the door, leaving the lights bright behind us. 

20. IMPATIENCE 

When I woke up I was confused. My thoughts were hazy, still twisted up in dreams and nightmares; it 
took me longer than it should have to realize where I was. 

This room was too bland to belong anywhere but in a hotel. The bedside lamps, bolted to the tables, 
were a dead giveaway, as were the long drapes made from the same fabric as the bedspread, and the 
generic watercolor prints on the walls. 

I tried to remember how I got here, but nothing came at first. 

I did remember the sleek black car, the glass in the windows darker than that on a limousine. The engine 
was almost silent, though we'd raced across the black freeways at more than twice the legal speed. 

And I remembered Alice sitting with me on the dark leather backseat. Somehow, during the long night, 
my head had ended up against her granite neck. My closeness didn't seem to bother her at all, and her 
cool, hard skin was oddly comforting to me. The front of her thin cotton shirt was cold, damp with the 
tears that streamed from my eyes until, red and sore, they ran dry. 

Sleep had evaded me; my aching eyes strained open even though the night finally ended and dawn broke 
over a low peak somewhere in California. The gray light, streaking across the cloudless sky, stung my 
eyes. But I couldn't close them; when I did, the images that flashed all too vividly, like still slides behind 
my lids, were unbearable. Charlie's broken expression — Edward's brutal snarl, teeth bared — Rosalie's 
resentful glare — the keen-eyed scrutiny of the tracker — the dead look in Edward's eyes after he 
kissed me the last time. . . I couldn't stand to see them. So I fought against my weariness and the sun rose 
higher. 

I was still awake when we came through a shallow mountain pass and the sun, behind us now, reflected 
off the tiled rooftops of the Valley of the Sun. I didn't have enough emotion left to be surprised that we'd 
made a three-day journey in one. I stared blankly at the wide, flat expanse laid out in front of me. 
Phoenix — the palm trees, the scrubby creosote, the haphazard lines of the intersecting freeways, the 
green swaths of golf courses and turquoise splotches of swimming pools, all submerged in a thin smog 
and embraced by the short, rocky ridges that weren't really big enough to be called mountains. 



The shadows of the palm trees slanted across the freeway — defined, sharper than I remembered, paler 
than they should be. Nothing could hide in these shadows. The bright, open freeway seemed benign 
enough. But I felt no relief, no sense of homecoming. 

"Which way to the airport, Bella?" Jasper had asked, and I flinched, though his voice was quite soft and 
un-alarming. It was the first sound, besides the purr of the car, to break the long night's silence. 

"Stay on the I-ten," I'd answered automatically. "We'll pass right by it." 

My brain had worked slowly through the fog of sleep deprivation. 

"Are we flying somewhere?" I'd asked Alice. 

"No, but it's better to be close, just in case." 

I remembered beginning the loop around Sky Harbor International. . . but not ending it. I suppose that 
must have been when I'd fallen asleep. 

Though, now that I'd chased the memories down, I did have a vague impression of leaving the car — the 
sun was just falling behind the horizon — my arm draped over Alice's shoulder and her arm firm around 
my waist, dragging me along as I stumbled through the warm, dry shadows. 

I had no memory of this room. 

I looked at the digital clock on the nightstand. The red numbers claimed it was three o'clock, but they 
gave no indication if it was night or day. No edge of light escaped the thick curtains, but the room was 
bright with the light from the lamps. 

I rose stiffly and staggered to the window, pulling back the drapes. 

It was dark outside. Three in the morning, then. My room looked out on a deserted section of the 
freeway and the new long-term parking garage for the airport. It was slightly comforting to be able to 
pinpoint time and place. 

I looked down at myself. I was still wearing Esme's clothes, and they didn't fit very well at all. I looked 
around the room, glad when I discovered my duffel bag on top of the low dresser. 

I was on my way to find new clothes when a light tap on the door made me jump. 

"Can I come in?" Alice asked. 

I took a deep breath. "Sure." 

She walked in, and looked me over cautiously. "You look like you could sleep longer," she said. 
I just shook my head. 

She drifted silently to the curtains and closed them securely before turning back to me. 

"We'll need to stay inside," she told me. 

"Okay." My voice was hoarse; it cracked. 

"Thirsty?" she asked. 

I shrugged. "I'm okay. How about you?" 



"Nothing unmanageable." She smiled. "I ordered some food for you, it's in the front room. Edward 
reminded me that you have to eat a lot more frequently than we do." 

I was instantiy more alert. "He called?" 

"No," she said, and watched as my face fell. "It was before we left." 

She took my hand carefully and led me through the door into the living room of the hotel suite. I could 
hear a low buzz of voices coming from the TV. Jasper sat motionlessly at the desk in the comer, his eyes 
watching the news with no glimmer of interest. 

I sat on the floor next to the coffee table, where a tray of food waited, and began picking at it without 
noticing what I was eating. 

Alice perched on the arm of the sofa and stared blankly at the TV like Jasper. 

I ate slowly, watching her, turning now and then to glance quickly at Jasper. It began to dawn on me that 
they were too still. They never looked away from the screen, though commercials were playing now. I 
pushed the tray away, my stomach abruptly uneasy. Alice looked down at me. 

"What's wrong, Alice?" I asked. 

"Nothing's wrong." Her eyes were wide, honest. . . and I didn't trust them. 
"What do we do now?" 
"We wait for Carlisle to call." 

"And should he have called by now?" I could see that I was near the mark. Alice's eyes flitted from mine 
to the phone on top of her leather bag and back. 

"What does that mean?" My voice quavered, and I fought to control it. "That he hasn't called yet?" 

"It just means that they don't have anything to tell us." 

But her voice was too even, and the air was harder to breathe. 

Jasper was suddenly beside Alice, closer to me than usual. 

"Bella," he said in a suspiciously soothing voice. "You have nothing to worry about. You are completely 
safe here." 

"I know that." 

"Then why are you frightened?" he asked, confused. He might feel the tenor of my emotions, but he 
couldn't read the reasons behind them. 

"You heard what Laurent said." My voice was just a whisper, but I was sure they could hear me. "He 
said James was lethal. What if something goes wrong, and they get separated? If something happens to 
any of them, Carlisle, Emmett. . . Edward. . . " I gulped. "If that wild female hurts Esme. . . " My voice had 
grown higher, a note of hysteria beginning to rise in it. "How could I live with myself when it's my fault? 
None of you should be risking yourselves for me — " 

"Bella, Bella, stop," he interrupted me, his words pouring out so quickly they were hard to understand. 
"You're worrying about all the wrong things, Bella. Trust me on this — none of us are in jeopardy. You 



are under too much strain as it is; don't add to it with wholly unnecessary worries. Listen to me!" he 
ordered, for I had looked away. "Our family is strong. Our only fear is losing you." 

"But why should you — " 

Alice interrupted this time, touching my cheek with her cold fingers. "It's been almost a century that 
Edward's been alone. Now he's found you. You can't see the changes that we see, we who have been 
with him for so long. Do you think any of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he 
loses you?" 

My guilt slowly subsided as I looked into her dark eyes. But, even as the calm spread over me, I knew I 
couldn't trust my feelings with Jasper there. 

It was a very long day. 

We stayed in the room. Alice called down to the front desk and asked them to ignore our maid service 
for now. The windows stayed shut, the TV on, though no one watched it. At regular intervals, food was 
delivered for me. The silver phone resting on Alice's bag seemed to grow bigger as the hours passed. 

My babysitters handled the suspense better than I did. As I fidgeted and paced, they simply grew more 
still, two statues whose eyes followed me imperceptibly as I moved. I occupied myself with memorizing 
the room; the striped pattern of the couches, tan, peach, cream, dull gold, and tan again. Sometimes I 
stared at the abstract prints, randomly finding pictures in the shapes, like I'd found pictures in the clouds 
as a child. I traced a blue hand, a woman combing her hair, a cat stretching. But when the pale red circle 
became a staring eye, I looked away. 

As the afternoon wore on, I went back to bed, simply for something to do. I hoped that by myself in the 
dark, I could give in to the terrible fears that hovered on the edge of my consciousness, unable to break 
through under Jasper's careful supervision. 

But Alice followed me casually, as if by some coincidence she had grown tired of the front room at the 
same time. I was beginning to wonder exactiy what sort of instructions Edward had given her. I lay 
across the bed, and she sat, legs folded, next to me. I ignored her at first, suddenly tired enough to sleep. 
But after a few minutes, the panic that had held off in Jasper's presence began to make itself known. I 
gave up on the idea of sleep quickly then, curling up into a small ball, wrapping my arms around my legs. 

"Alice?" I asked. 

"Yes?" 

I kept my voice very calm. "What do you think they're doing?" 

"Carlisle wanted to lead the tracker as far north as possible, wait for him to get close, and then turn and 
ambush him. Esme and Rosalie were supposed to head west as long as they could keep the female 
behind them. If she turned around, they were to head back to Forks and keep an eye on your dad. So I 
imagine things are going well if they can't call. It means the tracker is close enough that they don't want 
him to overhear." 

"And Esme?" 

"I think she must be back in Forks. She won't call if there's any chance the female will overhear. I expect 
they're all just being very careful." 



"Do you think they're safe, really?" 



"Bella, how many times do we have to tell you that there's no danger to us?" 

"Would you tell me the truth, though?" 

"Yes. I will always tell you the truth." Her voice was earnest. 

I deliberated for a moment, and decided she meant it. 

"Tell me then. . . how do you become a vampire?" 

My question caught her off guard. She was quiet. I rolled over to look at her, and her expression seemed 
ambivalent. 

"Edward doesn't want me to tell you that," she said firmly, but I sensed she didn't agree. 
"That's not fair. I think I have a right to know." 
"I know." 

I looked at her, waiting. 

She sighed. "He'll be extremely angry." 

"It's none of his business. This is between you and me. Alice, as a friend, I'm begging you." And we were 
friends now, somehow — as she must have known we would be all along. 

She looked at me with her splendid, wise eyes. . . choosing. 

"I'll tell you the mechanics of it," she said finally, "but I don't remember it myself, and I've never done it or 
seen it done, so keep in mind that I can only tell you the theory." 

I waited. 

"As predators, we have a glut of weapons in our physical arsenal — much, much more than really 
necessary. The strength, the speed, the acute senses, not to mention those of us like Edward, Jasper, and 
I, who have extra senses as well. And then, like a carnivorous flower, we are physically attractive to our 
prey." 

I was very still, remembering how pointedly Edward had demonstrated the same concept for me in the 
meadow. 

She smiled a wide, ominous smile. "We have another fairly superfluous weapon. We're also venomous," 
she said, her teeth glistening. "The venom doesn't kill — it's merely incapacitating. It works slowly, 
spreading through the bloodstream, so that, once bitten, our prey is in too much physical pain to escape 
us. Mostly superfluous, as I said. If we're that close, the prey doesn't escape. Of course, there are 
always exceptions. Carlisle, for example." 

"So. . . if the venom is left to spread. . . " I murmured. 

"It takes a few days for the transformation to be complete, depending on how much venom is in the 
bloodstream, how close the venom enters to the heart. As long as the heart keeps beating, the poison 
spreads, healing, changing the body as it moves through it. Eventually the heart stops, and the conversion 
is finished. But all that time, every minute of it, a victim would be wishing for death." 



I shivered. 



"It's not pleasant, you see." 



"Edward said that it was very hard to do. . . I don't quite understand," I said. 

"We're also like sharks in a way. Once we taste the blood, or even smell it for that matter, it becomes 
very hard to keep from feeding. Sometimes impossible. So you see, to actually bite someone, to taste the 
blood, it would begin the frenzy. It's difficult on both sides — the blood-lust on the one hand, the awful 
pain on the other." 

"Why do you think you don't remember?" 

"I don't know. For everyone else, the pain of transformation is the sharpest memory they have of their 
human life. I remember nothing of being human." Her voice was wistful. 

We lay silentiy, wrapped in our individual meditations. 

The seconds ticked by, and I had almost forgotten her presence, I was so enveloped in my thoughts. 

Then, without any warning, Alice leaped from the bed, landing lightiy on her feet. My head jerked up as I 
stared at her, startled. 

"Something's changed." Her voice was urgent, and she wasn't talking to me anymore. 

She reached the door at the same time Jasper did. He had obviously heard our conversation and her 
sudden exclamation. He put his hands on her shoulders and guided her back to the bed, sitting her on the 
edge. 

"What do you see?" he asked intently, staring into her eyes. Her eyes were focused on something very far 
away. I sat close to her, leaning in to catch her low, quick voice. 

"I see a room. It's long, and there are mirrors everywhere. The floor is wooden. He's in the room, and 
he's waiting. There's gold. . . a gold stripe across the mirrors." 

"Where is the room?" 

"I don't know. Something is missing — another decision hasn't been made yet." 
"How much time?" 

"It's soon. He'll be in the mirror room today, or maybe tomorrow. It all depends. He's waiting for 
something. And he's in the dark now." 

Jasper's voice was calm, methodical, as he questioned her in a practiced way. "What is he doing?" 
"He's watching TV. . . no, he's running a VCR, in the dark, in another place." 
"Can you see where he is?" 
"No, it's too dark." 

"And the mirror room, what else is there?" 

"Just the mirrors, and the gold. It's a band, around the room. And there's a black table with a big stereo, 
and a TV. He's touching the VCR there, but he doesn't watch the way he does in the dark room. This is 
the room where he waits." Her eyes drifted, then focused on Jasper's face. 



"There's nothing else?" 

She shook her head. They looked at each other, motionless. 
"What does it mean?" I asked. 

Neither of them answered for a moment, then Jasper looked at me. 

"It means the tracker's plans have changed. He's made a decision that will lead him to the mirror room, 
and the dark room." 

"But we don't know where those rooms are?" 
"No." 

"But we do know that he won't be in the mountains north of Washington, being hunted. He'll elude them." 
Alice's voice was bleak. 

"Should we call?" I asked. They traded a serious look, undecided. 
And the phone rang. 

Alice was across the room before I could lift my head to look at it. 
She pushed a button and held the phone to her ear, but she didn't speak first. 
"Carlisle," she breathed. She didn't seem surprised or relieved, the way I felt. 
"Yes," she said, glancing at me. She listened for a long moment. 

"I just saw him." She described again the vision she'd seen. "Whatever made him get on that plane. . . it 
was leading him to those rooms." She paused. "Yes," Alice said into the phone, and then she spoke to 
me. "Bella?" 

She held the phone out toward me. I ran to it. 

"Hello?" I breathed. 

"Bella," Edward said. 

"Oh, Edward! I was so worried." 

"Bella," he sighed in frustration, "I told you not to worry about anything but yourself." It was so 
unbelievably good to hear his voice. I felt the hovering cloud of despair lighten and drift back as he 
spoke. 

"Where are you?" 

"We're outside of Vancouver. Bella, I'm sorry — we lost him. He seems suspicious of us — he's careful 
to stay just far enough away that I can't hear what he's thinking. But he's gone now — it looks like he got 
on a plane. We think he's heading back to Forks to start over." I could hear Alice filling in Jasper behind 
me, her quick words blurring together into a humming noise. 

"I know. Alice saw that he got away." 

"You don't have to worry, though. He won't find anything to lead him to you. You just have to stay there 



and wait till we find him again." 



"I'll be fine. Is Esme with Charlie?" 

"Yes — the female has been in town. She went to the house, but while Charlie was at work. She hasn't 
gone near him, so don't be afraid. He's safe with Esme and Rosalie watching." 

"What is she doing?" 

"Probably trying to pick up the trail. She's been all through the town during the night. Rosalie traced her 
through the airport, all the roads around town, the school. . . she's digging, Bella, but there's nothing to 
find." 

"And you're sure Charlie's safe?" 

"Yes, Esme won't let him out of her sight. And we'll be there soon. If the tracker gets anywhere near 
Forks, we'll have him." 

"I miss you," I whispered. 

"I know, Bella. Believe me, I know. It's like you've taken half my self away with you." 
"Come and get it, then," I challenged. 

"Soon, as soon as I possibly can. I will make you safe first." His voice was hard. 
"I love you," I reminded him. 

"Could you believe that, despite everything I've put you through, I love you, too?" 
"Yes, I can, actually." 
"I'll come for you soon." 
'Til be waiting." 

As soon as the phone went dead, the cloud of depression began to creep over me again. 

I turned to give the phone back to Alice and found her and Jasper bent over the table, where Alice was 
sketching on a piece of hotel stationery. I leaned on the back of the couch, looking over her shoulder. 

She drew a room: long, rectangular, with a thinner, square section at the back. The wooden planks that 
made up the floor stretched lengthwise across the room. Down the walls were lines denoting the breaks 
in the mirrors. And then, wrapping around the walls, waist high, a long band. The band Alice said was 
gold. 

"It's a ballet studio," I said, suddenly recognizing the familiar shapes. 
They looked at me, surprised. 

"Do you know this room?" Jasper's voice sounded calm, but there was an undercurrent of something I 
couldn't identify. Alice bent her head to her work, her hand flying across the page now, the shape of an 
emergency exit taking shape against the back wall, the stereo and TV on a low table by the front right 
corner. 



"It looks like a place I used to go for dance lessons — when I was eight or nine. It was shaped just the 



same." I touched the page where the square section jutted out, narrowing the back part of the room. 
"That's where the bathrooms were — the doors were through the other dance floor. But the stereo was 
here" — I pointed to the left corner — "it was older, and there wasn't a TV. There was a window in the 
waiting room — you would see the room from this perspective if you looked through it." 

Alice and Jasper were staring at me. 

"Are you sure it's the same room?" Jasper asked, still calm. 

"No, not at all — I suppose most dance studios would look the same — the mirrors, the bar." I traced 
my finger along the ballet bar set against the mirrors. "It's just the shape that looked familiar." I touched 
the door, set in exactly the same place as the one I remembered. 

"Would you have any reason to go there now?" Alice asked, breaking my reverie. 

"No, I haven't been there in almost ten years. I was a terrible dancer — they always put me in the back 
for recitals," I admitted. 

"So there's no way it could be connected with you?" Alice asked intentiy. 

"No, I don't even think the same person owns it. I'm sure it's just another dance studio, somewhere." 
"Where was the studio you went to?" Jasper asked in a casual voice. 

"It was just around the comer from my mom's house. I used to walk there after school. . . " I said, my 
voice trailing off. I didn't miss the look they exchanged. 

"Here in Phoenix, then?" His voice was still casual. 

"Yes," I whispered. "Fifty-eighth Street and Cactus." 

We all sat in silence, staring at the drawing. 

"Alice, is that phone safe?" 

"Yes," she reassured me. "The number would just trace back to Washington." 
"Then I can use it to call my mom." 
"I thought she was in Florida." 

"She is — but she's coming home soon, and she can't come back to that house while. . . " My voice 
trembled. I was thinking about something Edward had said, about the red-haired female at Charlie's 
house, at the school, where my records would be. 

"How will you reach her?" 

"They don't have a permanent number except at the house — she's supposed to check her messages 
regularly." 

"Jasper?" Alice asked. 

He thought about it. "I don't think there's any way it could hurt — be sure you don't say where you are, 
of course." 

I reached eagerly for the phone and dialed the familiar number. It rang four times, and then I heard my 



mom's breezy voice telling me to leave a message. 



"Mom," I said after the beep, "it's me. Listen, I need you to do something. It's important. As soon as you 
get this message, call me at this number." Alice was already at my side, writing the number for me on the 
bottom of her picture. I read it carefully, twice. "Please don't go anywhere until you talk to me. Don't 
worry, I'm okay, but I have to talk to you right away, no matter how late you get this call, all right? I love 
you, Mom. Bye." I closed my eyes and prayed with all my might that no unforeseen change of plans 
would bring her home before she got my message. 

I settled into the sofa, nibbhng on a plate of leftover fruit, anticipating a long evening. I thought about 
calling Charlie, but I wasn't sure if I should be home by now or not. I concentrated on the news, watching 
out for stories about Florida, or about spring training — strikes or hurricanes or terrorist attacks — 
anything that might send them home early. 

Immortality must grant endless patience. Neither Jasper nor Alice seemed to feel the need to do anything 
at all. For a while, Alice sketched the vague outiine of the dark room from her vision, as much as she 
could see in the light from the TV. But when she was done, she simply sat, looking at the blank walls with 
her timeless eyes. Jasper, too, seemed to have no urge to pace, or peek through the curtains, or run 
screaming out the door, the way I did. 

I must have fallen asleep on the couch, waiting for the phone to ring again. The touch of Alice's cold 
hands woke me briefly as she carried me to the bed, but I was unconscious again before my head hit the 
pillow. 



21. PHONE CALL 



I could feel it was too early again when I woke, and I knew I was getting the schedule of my days and 
nights slowly reversed. I lay in my bed and listened to the quiet voices of Alice and Jasper in the other 
room. That they were loud enough for me to hear at all was strange. I rolled till my feet touched the floor 
and then staggered to the living room. 

The clock on the TV said it was just after two in the morning. Alice and Jasper were sitting together on 
the sofa, Alice sketching again while Jasper looked over her shoulder. They didn't look up when I 
entered, too engrossed in Alice's work. 

I crept to Jasper's side to peek. 

"Did she see something more?" I asked him quietiy. 

"Yes. Something's brought him back to the room with the VCR, but it's light now." 

I watched as Alice drew a square room with dark beams across its low ceiling. The walls were paneled 
in wood, a little too dark, out of date. The floor had a dark carpet with a pattern in it. There was a large 
window against the south wall, and an opening through the west wall led to the living room. One side of 
that entrance was stone — a large tan stone fireplace that was open to both rooms. The focus of the 
room from this perspective, the TV and VCR, balanced on a too-small wooden stand, were in the 
southwest corner of the room. An aged sectional sofa curved around in front of the TV, a round coffee 
table in front of it. 



"The phone goes there," I whispered, pointing. 



Two pairs of eternal eyes stared at me. 
"That's my mother's house." 

Alice was already off the couch, phone in hand, dialing. I stared at the precise rendering of my mother's 
family room. Uncharacteristically, Jasper slid closer to me. He lightiy touched his hand to my shoulder, 
and the physical contact seemed to make his calming influence stronger. The panic stayed dull, 
unfocused. 

Alice's lips were trembling with the speed of her words, the low buzzing impossible to decipher. I 
couldn't concentrate. 

"Bella," Alice said. I looked at her numbly. 

"Bella, Edward is coming to get you. He and Emmett and Carlisle are going to take you somewhere, to 
hide you for a while." 

"Edward is coming?" The words were like a life vest, holding my head above the flood. 

"Yes, he's catching the first flight out of Seattle. We'll meet him at the airport, and you'll leave with him." 

"But, my mother. . . he came here for my mother, Alice! " Despite Jasper, the hysteria bubbled up in my 
voice. 

"Jasper and I will stay till she's safe." 

"I can't win, Alice. You can't guard everyone I know forever. Don't you see what he's doing? He's not 
tracking me at all. He'll find someone, he'll hurt someone I love. . . Alice, I can't — " 

"We'll catch him, Bella," she assured me. 

"And what if you get hurt, Alice? Do you think that's okay with me? Do you think it's only my human 
family he can hurt me with?" 

Alice looked meaningfully at Jasper. A deep, heavy fog of lethargy washed over me, and my eyes closed 
without my permission. My mind struggled against the fog, realizing what was happening. I forced my 
eyes open and stood up, stepping away from Jasper's hand. 

"I don't want to go back to sleep," I snapped. 

I walked to my room and shut the door, slammed it really, so I could be free to go to pieces privately. 
This time Alice didn't follow me. For three and a half hours I stared at the wall, curled in a ball, rocking. 
My mind went around in circles, trying to come up with some way out of this nightmare. There was no 
escape, no reprieve. I could see only one possible end looming darkly in my future. The only question 
was how many other people would be hurt before I reached it. 

The only solace, the only hope I had left, was knowing that I would see Edward soon. Maybe, if I could 
just see his face again, I would also be able to see the solution that eluded me now. 

When the phone rang, I returned to the front room, a little ashamed of my behavior. I hoped I hadn't 
offended either of them, that they would know how grateful I was for the sacrifices they were making on 
my account. 

Alice was talking as rapidly as ever, but what caught my attention was that, for the first time, Jasper was 
not in the room. I looked at the clock — it was five-thirty in the morning. 



"They're just boarding their plane," Alice told me. "They'll land at nine-forty-five." Just a few more hours 
to keep breathing till he was here. 

"Where's Jasper?" 

"He went to check out." 

"You aren't staying here?" 

"No, we're relocating closer to your mother's house." 
My stomach twisted uneasily at her words. 

But the phone rang again, distracting me. She looked surprised, but I was already walking forward, 
reaching hopefully for the phone. 

"Hello?" Alice asked. "No, she's right here." She held the phone out to me. Your mother, she mouthed. 
"Hello?" 

"Bella? Bella?" It was my mother's voice, in a familiar tone I had heard a thousand times in my childhood, 
anytime I'd gotten too close to the edge of the sidewalk or strayed out of her sight in a crowded place. It 
was the sound of panic. 

I sighed. I'd been expecting this, though I'd tried to make my message as unalarming as possible without 
lessening the urgency of it. 

"Calm down, Mom," I said in my most soothing voice, walking slowly away from Alice. I wasn't sure if I 
could he as convincingly with her eyes on me. "Everything is fine, okay? Just give me a minute and I'll 
explain everything, I promise." 

I paused, surprised that she hadn't interrupted me yet. 

"Mom?" 

"Be very careful not to say anything until I tell you to." The voice I heard now was as urifamiliar as it was 
unexpected. It was a man's tenor voice, a very pleasant, generic voice — the kind of voice that you 
heard in the background of luxury car commercials. He spoke very quickly. 

"Now, I don't need to hurt your mother, so please do exactly as I say, and she'll be fine." He paused for 
a minute while I listened in mute horror. "That's very good," he congratulated. "Now repeat after me, and 
do try to sound natural. Please say, 'No, Mom, stay where you are.'" 

"No, Mom, stay where you are." My voice was barely more than a whisper. 

"I can see this is going to be difficult." The voice was amused, still light and friendly. "Why don't you walk 
into another room now so your face doesn't ruin everything? There's no reason for your mother to suffer. 
As you're walking, please say, 'Mom, please listen to me.' Say it now." 

"Mom, please listen to me," my voice pleaded. I walked very slowly to the bedroom, feeling Alice's 
worried stare on my back. I shut the door behind me, trying to think clearly through the terror that 
gripped my brain. 

"There now, are you alone? Just answer yes or no." 



"Yes." 

"But they can still hear you, I'm sure." 
"Yes." 

"All right, then," the agreeable voice continued, "say, 'Mom, trust me.'" 
"Mom, trust me." 

"This worked out rather better than I expected. I was prepared to wait, but your mother arrived ahead of 
schedule. It's easier this way, isn't it? Less suspense, less anxiety for you." 

I waited. 

"Now I want you to listen very carefully. I'm going to need you to get away from your friends; do you 
think you can do that? Answer yes or no." 

"No." 

"I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping you would be a little more creative than that. Do you think you could 
get away from them if your mother's life depended on it? Answer yes or no." 

Somehow, there had to be a way. I remembered that we were going to the airport. Sky Harbor 
International Airport: crowded, confusingly laid out. . . 

"Yes." 

"That's better. I'm sure it won't be easy, but if I get the slightest hint that you have any company, well, that 
would be very bad for your mother," the friendly voice promised. "You must know enough about us by 
now to realize how quickly I would know if you tried to bring anyone along with you. And how little time 
I would need to deal with your mother if that was the case. Do you understand? Answer yes or no." 

"Yes." My voice broke. 

"Very good, Bella. Now this is what you have to do. I want you to go to your mother's house. Next to 
the phone there will be a number. Call it, and I'll tell you where to go from there." I already knew where I 
would go, and where this would end. But I would follow his instructions exactiy. "Can you do that? 
Answer yes or no." 

"Yes." 

"Before noon, please, Bella. I haven't got all day," he said politely. 
"Where's Phil?" I asked tersely. 

"Ah, be careful now, Bella. Wait until I ask you to speak, please." 
I waited. 

"It's important, now, that you don't make your friends suspicious when you go back to them. Tell them 
that your mother called, and that you talked her out of coming home for the time being. Now repeat after 
me, 'Thank you, Mom.' Say it now." 

"Thank you, Mom." The tears were coming. I tried to fight them back. 



"Say, 1 love you, Mom, I'll see you soon.' Say it now." 

"I love you, Mom." My voice was thick. "I'll see you soon," I promised. 

"Goodbye, Bella. I look forward to seeing you again." He hung up. 

I held the phone to my ear. My joints were frozen with terror — I couldn't unbend my fingers to drop it. 

I knew I had to think, but my head was filled with the sound of my mother's panic. Seconds ticked by 
while I fought for control. 

Slowly, slowly, my thoughts started to break past that brick wall of pain. To plan. For I had no choices 
now but one: to go to the mirrored room and die. I had no guarantees, nothing to give to keep my mother 
alive. I could only hope that James would be satisfied with winning the game, that beating Edward would 
be enough. Despair gripped me; there was no way to bargain, nothing I could offer or withhold that could 
influence him. But I still had no choice. I had to try. 

I pushed the terror back as well as I could. My decision was made. It did no good to waste time 
agonizing over the outcome. I had to think clearly, because Alice and Jasper were waiting for me, and 
evading them was absolutely essential, and absolutely impossible. 

I was suddenly grateful that Jasper was gone. If he had been here to feel my anguish in the last five 
minutes, how could I have kept them from being suspicious? I choked back the dread, the anxiety, tried 
to stifle it. I couldn't afford it now. I didn't know when he would return. 

I concentrated on my escape. I had to hope that my familiarity with the airport would turn the odds in my 
favor. Somehow, I had to keep Alice away. . . 

I knew Alice was in the other room waiting for me, curious. But I had to deal with one more thing in 
private, before Jasper was back. 

I had to accept that I wouldn't see Edward again, not even one last glimpse of his face to carry with me 
to the mirror room. I was going to hurt him, and I couldn't say goodbye. I let the waves of torture wash 
over me, have their way for a time. Then I pushed them back, too, and went to face Alice. 

The only expression I could manage was a dull, dead look. I saw her alarm and I didn't wait for her to 
ask. I had just one script and I'd never manage improvisation now. 

"My mom was worried, she wanted to come home. But it's okay, I convinced her to stay away." My 
voice was lifeless. 

"We'll make sure she's fine, Bella, don't worry." 
I turned away; I couldn't let her see my face. 

My eye fell on a blank page of the hotel stationery on the desk. I went to it slowly, a plan forming. There 
was an envelope there, too. That was good. 

"Alice," I asked slowly, without turning, keeping my voice level. "If I write a letter for my mother, would 
you give it to her? Leave it at the house, I mean." 

"Sure, Bella." Her voice was careful. She could see me coming apart at the seams. I had to keep my 
emotions under better control. 

I went into the bedroom again, and knelt next to the little bedside table to write. 



"Edward," I wrote. My hand was shaking, the letters were hardly legible. 



/ love you. I am so sorry. He has my mom, and I have to try. I know it may not work. I am so very, 
very sorry. 

Don 't be angry with Alice and Jasper. If I get away from them it will be a miracle. Tell them thank 
you for me. Alice especially, please. 

And please, please, don't come after him. That's what he wants. I think. I can't bear it if anyone 
has to be hurt because of me, especially you. Please, this is the only thing I can ask you now. For 
me. 

I love you. Forgive me. 
Bella 



I folded the letter carefully, and sealed it in the envelope. Eventually he would find it. I only hoped he 
would understand, and listen to me just this once. 

And then I carefully sealed away my heart. 
22. HIDE-AND-SEEK 

It had taken much less time than I'd thought — all the terror, the despair, the shattering of my heart. The 
minutes were ticking by more slowly than usual. Jasper still hadn't come back when I returned to Alice. I 
was afraid to be in the same room with her, afraid that she would guess. . . and afraid to hide from her for 
the same reason. 

I would have thought I was far beyond the ability to be surprised, my thoughts tortured and unstable, but 
I was surprised when I saw Alice bent over the desk, gripping the edge with two hands. 

"Alice?" 

She didn't react when I called her name, but her head was slowly rocking side to side, and I saw her 
face. Her eyes were blank, dazed. . . My thoughts flew to my mother. Was I already too late? 

I hurried to her side, reaching out automatically to touch her hand. 

"Alice!" Jasper's voice whipped, and then he was right behind her, his hands curling over hers, loosening 
them from their grip on the table. Across the room, the door swung shut with a low click. 

"What is it?" he demanded. 

She turned her face away from me, into his chest. "Bella," she said. 
"I'm right here," I replied. 

Her head twisted around, her eyes locking on mine, their expression still strangely blank. I realized at 



once that she hadn't been speaking to me, she'd been answering Jasper's question. 

"What did you see?" I said — and there was no question in my flat, uncaring voice. 

Jasper looked at me sharply. I kept my expression vacant and waited. His eyes were confused as they 
flickered swiftly between Alice's face and mine, feeling the chaos. . . for I could guess what Alice had 
seen now. 

I felt a tranquil atmosphere settle around me. I welcomed it, using it to keep my emotions disciplined, 
under control. 

Alice, too, recovered herself. 

"Nothing, really," she answered finally, her voice remarkably calm and convincing. "Just the same room 
as before." 

She finally looked at me, her expression smooth and withdrawn. "Did you want breakfast?" 

"No, I'll eat at the airport." I was very calm, too. I went to the bathroom to shower. Almost as if I were 
borrowing Jasper's strange extra sense, I could feel Alice's wild — though well-concealed — 
desperation to have me out of the room, to be alone with Jasper. So she could tell him that they were 
doing something wrong, that they were going to fail. . . 

I got ready methodically, concentrating on each little task. I left my hair down, swirling around me, 
covering my face. The peaceful mood Jasper created worked its way through me and helped me think 
clearly. Helped me plan. I dug through my bag until I found my sock full of money. I emptied it into my 
pocket. 

I was anxious to get to the airport, and glad when we left by seven. I sat alone this time in the back of the 
dark car. Alice leaned against the door, her face toward Jasper but, behind her sunglasses, shooting 
glances in my direction every few seconds. 

"Alice?" I asked indifferently. 

She was wary. "Yes?" 

"How does it work? The things that you see?" I stared out the side window, and my voice sounded 
bored. "Edward said it wasn't definite. . . that things change?" It was harder than I would have thought to 
say his name. That must have been what alerted Jasper, why a fresh wave of serenity filled the car. 

"Yes, things change. . . " she murmured — hopefully, I thought. "Some things are more certain than 
others. . . like the weather. People are harder. I only see the course they're on while they're on it. Once 
they change their minds — make a new decision, no matter how small — the whole future shifts." 

I nodded thoughtfully. "So you couldn't see James in Phoenix until he decided to come here." 

"Yes," she agreed, wary again. 

And she hadn't seen me in the mirror room with James until I'd made the decision to meet him there. I 
tried not to think about what else she might have seen. I didn't want my panic to make Jasper more 
suspicious. They would be watching me twice as carefully now, anyway, after Alice's vision. This was 
going to be impossible. 

We got to the airport. Luck was with me, or maybe it was just good odds. Edward's plane was landing 



in terminal four, the largest terminal, where most flights landed — so it wasn't surprising that his was. But 
it was the terminal I needed: the biggest, the most confusing. And there was a door on level three that 
might be the only chance. 

We parked on the fourth floor of the huge garage. I led the way, for once more knowledgeable about my 
surroundings than they were. We took the elevator down to level three, where the passengers unloaded. 
Alice and Jasper spent a long time looking at the departing flights board. I could hear them discussing the 
pros and cons of New York, Atlanta, Chicago. Places I'd never seen. And would never see. 

I waited for my opportunity, impatient, unable to stop my toe from tapping. We sat in the long rows of 
chairs by the metal detectors, Jasper and Alice pretending to people- watch but really watching me. Every 
inch I shifted in my seat was followed by a quick glance out of the comer of their eyes. It was hopeless. 
Should I run? Would they dare to stop me physically in this public place? Or would they simply follow? 

I pulled the unmarked envelope out of my pocket and set it on top of Alice's black leather bag. She 
looked at me. 

"My letter," I said. She nodded, tucking it under the top flap. He would find it soon enough. 

The minutes passed and Edward's arrival grew closer. It was amazing how every cell in my body seemed 
to know he was coming, to long for his corning. That made it very hard. I found myself trying to think of 
excuses to stay, to see him first and then make my escape. But I knew that was impossible if I was going 
to have any chance to get away. 

Several times Alice offered to go get breakfast with me. Later, I told her, not yet. 

I stared at the arrival board, watching as flight after flight arrived on time. The flight from Seattle crept 
closer to the top of the board. 

And then, when I had only thirty minutes to make my escape, the numbers changed. His plane was ten 
minutes early. I had no more time. 

"I think I'll eat now," I said quickly. 

Alice stood. "I'll come with you." 

"Do you mind if Jasper comes instead?" I asked. "I'm feeling a little. . . " I didn't finish the sentence. My 
eyes were wild enough to convey what I didn't say. 

Jasper stood up. Alice's eyes were confused, but — I saw to my relief — not suspicious. She must be 
attributing the change in her vision to some maneuver of the tracker's rather than a betrayal by me. 

Jasper walked silentiy beside me, his hand on the small of my back, as if he were guiding me. I pretended 
a lack of interest in the first few airport cafes, my head scanning for what I really wanted. And there it 
was, around the corner, out of Alice's sharp sight: the level-three ladies' room. 

"Do you mind?" I asked Jasper as we passed. "I'll just be a moment." 

'Til be right here," he said. 

As soon as the door shut behind me, I was running. I remembered the time I had gotten lost from this 
bathroom, because it had two exits. 

Outside the far door it was only a short sprint to the elevators, and if Jasper stayed where he said he 



would, I'd never be in his line of sight. I didn't look behind me as I ran. This was my only chance, and 
even if he saw me, I had to keep going. People stared, but I ignored them. Around the corner the 
elevators were waiting, and I dashed forward, throwing my hand between the closing doors of a full 
elevator headed down. I squeezed in beside the irritated passengers, and checked to make sure that the 
button for level one had been pushed. It was already lit, and the doors closed. 

As soon as the door opened I was off again, to the sound of annoyed murmurs behind me. I slowed 
myself as I passed the security guards by the luggage carousels, only to break into a run again as the exit 
doors came into view. I had no way of knowing if Jasper was looking for me yet. 

I would have only seconds if he was following my scent. I jumped out the automatic doors, nearly 
smacking into the glass when they opened too slowly. 

Along the crowded curb there wasn't a cab in sight. 

I had no time. Alice and Jasper were either about to realize I was gone, or they already had. They would 
find me in a heartbeat. 

A shuttle to the Hyatt was just closing its doors a few feet behind me. 
"Wait!" I called, running, waving at the driver. 

"This is the shuttle to the Hyatt," the driver said in confusion as he opened the doors. 
"Yes," I huffed, "that's where I'm going." I hurried up the steps. 

He looked askance at my luggage-less state, but then shrugged, not caring enough to ask. 

Most of the seats were empty. I sat as far from the other travelers as possible, and watched out the 
window as first the sidewalk, and then the airport, drifted away. I couldn't help imagining Edward, where 
he would stand at the edge of the road when he found the end of my trail. I couldn't cry yet, I told myself. 
I still had a long way to go. 

My luck held. In front of the Hyatt, a tired-looking couple was getting their last suitcase out of the trunk 
of a cab. I jumped out of the shuttle and ran to the cab, sliding into the seat behind the driver. The tired 
couple and the shuttle driver stared at me. 

I told the surprised cabbie my mother's address. "I need to get there as soon as possible." 
"That's in Scottsdale," he complained. 
I threw four twenties over the seat. 
"Will that be enough?" 
"Sure, kid, no problem." 

I sat back against the seat, folding my arms across my lap. The familiar city began to rush around me, but 
I didn't look out the windows. I exerted myself to maintain control. I was determined not to lose myself at 
this point, now that my plan was successfully completed. There was no point in indulging in more terror, 
more anxiety. My path was set. I just had to follow it now. 

So, instead of panicking, I closed my eyes and spent the twenty minutes' drive with Edward. 

I imagined that I had stayed at the airport to meet Edward. I visualized how I would stand on my toes, 



the sooner to see his face. How quickly, how gracefully he would move through the crowds of people 
separating us. And then I would run to close those last few feet between us — reckless as always — and 
I would be in his marble arms, finally safe. 

I wondered where we would have gone. North somewhere, so he could be outside in the day. Or maybe 
somewhere very remote, so we could lay in the sun together again. I imagined him by the shore, his skin 
sparkling like the sea. It wouldn't matter how long we had to hide. To be trapped in a hotel room with 
him would be a kind of heaven. So many questions I still had for him. I could talk to him forever, never 
sleeping, never leaving his side. 

I could see his face so clearly now. . . almost hear his voice. And, despite all the horror and hopelessness, 
I was fleetingly happy. So involved was I in my escapist daydreams, I lost all track of the seconds racing 

by- 

"Hey, what was the number?" 

The cabbie's question punctured my fantasy, letting all the colors run out of my lovely delusions. Fear, 
bleak and hard, was waiting to fill the empty space they left behind. 

"Fifty-eight twenty-one." My voice sounded strangled. The cabbie looked at me, nervous that I was 
having an episode or something. 

"Here we are, then." He was anxious to get me out of his car, probably hoping I wouldn't ask for my 
change. 

"Thank you," I whispered. There was no need to be afraid, I reminded myself. The house was empty. I 
had to hurry; my mom was waiting for me, frightened, depending on me. 

I ran to the door, reaching up automatically to grab the key under the eave. I unlocked the door. It was 
dark inside, empty, normal. I ran to the phone, turning on the kitchen light on my way. There, on the 
whiteboard, was a ten-digit number written in a small, neat hand. My fingers stumbled over the keypad, 
making mistakes. I had to hang up and start again. I concentrated only on the buttons this time, carefully 
pressing each one in turn. I was successful. I held the phone to my ear with a shaking hand. It rang only 
once. 

"Hello, Bella," that easy voice answered. "That was very quick. I'm impressed." 
"Is my mom all right?" 

"She's perfectiy fine. Don't worry, Bella, I have no quarrel with her. Unless you didn't come alone, of 
course." Light, amused. 

"I'm alone." I'd never been more alone in my entire life. 

"Very good. Now, do you know the ballet studio just around the comer from your home?" 
"Yes. I know how to get there." 
"Well, then, I'll see you very soon." 
I hung up. 

I ran from the room, through the door, out into the baking heat. 

There was no time to look back at my house, and I didn't want to see it as it was now — empty, a 



symbol of fear instead of sanctuary. The last person to walk through those familiar rooms was my enemy. 

From the comer of my eye, I could almost see my mother standing in the shade of the big eucalyptus tree 
where I'd played as a child. Or kneeling by the little plot of dirt around the mailbox, the cemetery of all 
the flowers she'd tried to grow. The memories were better than any reality I would see today. But I raced 
away from them, toward the comer, leaving everything behind me. 

I felt so slow, like I was running through wet sand — I couldn't seem to get enough purchase from the 
concrete. I tripped several times, once falling, catching myself with my hands, scraping them on the 
sidewalk, and then lurching up to plunge forward again. But at last I made it to the comer. Just another 
street now; I ran, sweat pouring down my face, gasping. The sun was hot on my skin, too bright as it 
bounced off the white concrete and blinded me. I felt dangerously exposed. More fiercely than I would 
have dreamed I was capable of, I wished for the green, protective forests of Forks. . . of home. 

When I rounded the last corner, onto Cactus, I could see the studio, looking just as I remembered it. The 
parking lot in front was empty, the vertical blinds in all the windows drawn. I couldn't run anymore — I 
couldn't breathe; exertion and fear had gotten the best of me. I thought of my mother to keep my feet 
moving, one in front of the other. 

As I got closer, I could see the sign inside the door. It was handwritten on hot pink paper; it said the 
dance studio was closed for spring break. I touched the handle, tugged on it cautiously. It was unlocked. 
I fought to catch my breath, and opened the door. 

The lobby was dark and empty, cool, the air conditioner tlmimming. The plastic molded chairs were 
stacked along the walls, and the carpet smelled like shampoo. The west dance floor was dark, I could 
see through the open viewing window. The east dance floor, the bigger room, was lit. But the blinds were 
closed on the window. 

Terror seized me so strongly that I was literally trapped by it. I couldn't make my feet move forward. 
And then my mother's voice called. 

"Bella? Bella?" That same tone of hysterical panic. I sprinted to the door, to the sound of her voice. 

"Bella, you scared me! Don't you ever do that to me again!" Her voice continued as I ran into the long, 
high-ceilinged room. 

I stared around me, trying to find where her voice was coming from. I heard her laugh, and I whirled to 
the sound. 

There she was, on the TV screen, tousling my hair in relief. It was Thanksgiving, and I was twelve. We'd 
gone to see my grandmother in California, the last year before she died. We went to the beach one day, 
and I'd leaned too far over the edge of the pier. She'd seen my feet flailing, trying to reclaim my balance. 
"Bella? Bella?" she'd called to me in fear. 

And then the TV screen was blue. 

I turned slowly. He was standing very still by the back exit, so still I hadn't noticed him at first. In his hand 
was a remote control. We stared at each other for a long moment, and then he smiled. 

He walked toward me, quite close, and then passed me to put the remote down next to the VCR. I 
turned carefully to watch him. 

"Sorry about that, Bella, but isn't it better that your mother didn't really have to be involved in all this?" 



His voice was courteous, kind. 



And suddenly it hit me. My mother was safe. She was still in Florida. She'd never gotten my message. 
She'd never been terrified by the dark red eyes in the abnormally pale face before me. She was safe. 

"Yes," I answered, my voice saturated with relief. 

"You don't sound angry that I tricked you." 

"I'm not." My sudden high made me brave. What did it matter now? It would soon be over. Charlie and 
Mom would never be harmed, would never have to fear. I felt almost giddy. Some analytical part of my 
mind warned me that I was dangerously close to snapping from the stress. 

"How odd. You really mean it." His dark eyes assessed me with interest. The irises were nearly black, 
just a hint of ruby around the edges. Thirsty. "I will give your strange coven this much, you humans can be 
quite interesting. I guess I can see the draw of observing you. It's amazing — some of you seem to have 
no sense of your own self-interest at all." 

He was standing a few feet away from me, arms folded, looking at me curiously. There was no menace in 
his face or stance. He was so very average-looking, nothing remarkable about his face or body at all. 
Just the white skin, the circled eyes I'd grown so used to. He wore a pale blue, long-sleeved shirt and 
faded blue jeans. 

"I suppose you're going to tell me that your boyfriend will avenge you?" he asked, hopefully it seemed to 
me. 

"No, I don't think so. At least, I asked him not to." 
"And what was his reply to that?" 

"I don't know." It was strangely easy to converse with this genteel hunter. "I left him a letter." 

"How romantic, a last letter. And do you think he will honor it?" His voice was just a little harder now, a 
hint of sarcasm marring his polite tone. 

"I hope so." 

"Hmmm. Well, our hopes differ then. You see, this was all just a little too easy, too quick. To be quite 
honest, I'm disappointed. I expected a much greater challenge. And, after all, I only needed a little luck." 

I waited in silence. 

"When Victoria couldn't get to your father, I had her find out more about you. There was no sense in 
running all over the planet chasing you down when I could comfortably wait for you in a place of my 
choosing. So, after I talked to Victoria, I decided to come to Phoenix to pay your mother a visit. I'd 
heard you say you were going home. At first, I never dreamed you meant it. But then I wondered. 
Humans can be very predictable; they like to be somewhere familiar, somewhere safe. And wouldn't it be 
the perfect ploy, to go to the last place you should be when you're hiding — the place that you said you'd 
be. 

"But of course I wasn't sure, it was just a hunch. I usually get a feeling about the prey that I'm hunting, a 
sixth sense, if you will. I listened to your message when I got to your mother's house, but of course I 
couldn't be sure where you'd called from. It was very useful to have your number, but you could have 
been in Antarctica for all I knew, and the game wouldn't work unless you were close by. 



"Then your boyfriend got on a plane to Phoenix. Victoria was monitoring them for me, naturally; in a 
game with this many players, I couldn't be working alone. And so they told me what I'd hoped, that you 
were here after all. I was prepared; I'd already been through your charming home movies. And then it 
was simply a matter of the bluff. 

"Very easy, you know, not really up to my standards. So, you see, I'm hoping you're wrong about your 
boyfriend. Edward, isn't it?" 

I didn't answer. The bravado was wearing off. I sensed that he was coming to the end of his gloat. It 
wasn't meant for me anyway. There was no glory in beating me, a weak human. 

"Would you mind, very much, if I left a little letter of my own for your Edward?" 

He took a step back and touched a palm-sized digital video camera balanced carefully on top of the 
stereo. A small red light indicated that it was already running. He adjusted it a few times, widened the 
frame. I stared at him in horror. 

"I'm sorry, but I just don't think he'll be able to resist hunting me after he watches this. And I wouldn't 
want him to miss anything. It was all for him, of course. You're simply a human, who unfortunately was in 
the wrong place, at the wrong time, and indisputably running with the wrong crowd, I might add." 

He stepped toward me, smiling. "Before we begin. . . " 

I felt a curl of nausea in the pit of my stomach as he spoke. This was something I had not anticipated. 

"I would just like to rub it in, just a little bit. The answer was there all along, and I was so afraid Edward 
would see that and ruin my fun. It happened once, oh, ages ago. The one and only time my prey escaped 
me. 

"You see, the vampire who was so stupidly fond of this little victim made the choice that your Edward 
was too weak to make. When the old one knew I was after his little friend, he stole her from the asylum 
where he worked — I never will understand the obsession some vampires seem to form with you 
humans — and as soon as he freed her he made her safe. She didn't even seem to notice the pain, poor 
little creature. She'd been stuck in that black hole of a cell for so long. A hundred years earlier and she 
would have been burned at the stake for her visions. In the nineteen- twenties it was the asylum and the 
shock treatments. When she opened her eyes, strong with her fresh youth, it was like she'd never seen 
the sun before. The old vampire made her a strong new vampire, and there was no reason for me to 
touch her then." He sighed. "I destroyed the old one in vengeance." 

"Alice," I breathed, astonished. 

"Yes, your little friend. I was surprised to see her in the clearing. So I guess her coven ought to be able to 
derive some comfort from this experience. I get you, but they get her. The one victim who escaped me, 
quite an honor, actually. 

"And she did smell so delicious. I still regret that I never got to taste. . . She smelled even better than you 
do. Sorry — I don't mean to be offensive. You have a very nice smell. Floral, somehow. . . " 

He took another step toward me, till he was just inches away. He lifted a lock of my hair and sniffed at it 
delicately. Then he gentiy patted the strand back into place, and I felt his cool fingertips against my throat. 
He reached up to stroke my cheek once quickly with his thumb, his face curious. I wanted so badly to 
run, but I was frozen. I couldn't even flinch away. 

"No," he murmured to himself as he dropped his hand, "I don't understand." He sighed. "Well, I suppose 



we should get on with it. And then I can call your friends and tell them where to find you, and my little 
message." 

I was definitely sick now. There was pain corning, I could see it in his eyes. It wouldn't be enough for him 
to win, to feed and go. There would be no quick end like I'd been counting on. My knees began to 
shake, and I was afraid I was going to fall. 

He stepped back, and began to circle, casually, as if he were trying to get a better view of a statue in a 
museum. His face was still open and friendly as he decided where to start. 

Then he slumped forward, into a crouch I recognized, and his pleasant smile slowly widened, grew, till it 
wasn't a smile at all but a contortion of teeth, exposed and glistening. 

I couldn't help myself — I tried to run. As useless as I knew it would be, as weak as my knees already 
were, panic took over and I bolted for the emergency door. 

He was in front of me in a flash. I didn't see if he used his hand or his foot, it was too fast. A crushing 
blow struck my chest — I felt myself flying backward, and then heard the crunch as my head bashed into 
the mirrors. The glass buckled, some of the pieces shattering and splintering on the floor beside me. 

I was too stunned to feel the pain. I couldn't breathe yet. 

He walked toward me slowly. 

"That's a very nice effect," he said, examining the mess of glass, his voice friendly again. "I thought this 
room would be visually dramatic for my little film. That's why I picked this place to meet you. It's perfect, 
isn't it?" 

I ignored him, scrambling on my hands and knees, crawling toward the other door. 

He was over me at once, his foot stepping down hard on my leg. I heard the sickening snap before I felt 
it. But then I did feel it, and I couldn't hold back my scream of agony. I twisted up to reach for my leg, 
and he was standing over me, smiling. 

"Would you like to rethink your last request?" he asked pleasantly. His toe nudged my broken leg and I 
heard a piercing scream. With a shock, I realized it was mine. 

"Wouldn't you rather have Edward try to find me?" he prompted. 

"No!" I croaked. "No, Edward, don't — " And then something smashed into my face, throwing me back 
into the broken mirrors. 

Over the pain of my leg, I felt the sharp rip across my scalp where the glass cut into it. And then the 
warm wetness began to spread through my hair with alarming speed. I could feel it soaking the shoulder 
of my shirt, hear it dripping on the wood below. The smell of it twisted my stomach. 

Through the nausea and dizziness I saw something that gave me a sudden, final shred of hope. His eyes, 
merely intent before, now burned with an uncontrollable need. The blood — spreading crimson across 
my white shirt, pooling rapidly on the floor — was driving him mad with thirst. No matter his original 
intentions, he couldn't draw this out much longer. 

Let it be quick now, was all I could hope as the flow of blood from my head sucked my consciousness 
away with it. My eyes were closing. 



I heard, as if from underwater, the final growl of the hunter. I could see, through the long tunnels my eyes 
had become, his dark shape coming toward me. With my last effort, my hand instinctively raised to 
protect my face. My eyes closed, and I drifted. 

23. THE ANGEL 



As I drifted, I dreamed. 

Where I floated, under the dark water, I heard the happiest sound my mind could conjure up — as 
beautiful, as uphfting, as it was ghastiy. It was another snarl; a deeper, wilder roar that rang with fury. 

I was brought back, almost to the surface, by a sharp pain slashing my upraised hand, but I couldn't find 
my way back far enough to open my eyes. 

And then I knew I was dead. 

Because, through the heavy water, I heard the sound of an angel calling my name, calling me to the only 
heaven I wanted. 

"Oh no, Bella, no!" the angel's voice cried in horror. 

Behind that longed-for sound was another noise — an awful tumult that my mind shied away from. A 
vicious bass growling, a shocking snapping sound, and a high keening, suddenly breaking off. . . 

I tried to concentrate on the angel's voice instead. 

"Bella, please! Bella, listen to me, please, please, Bella, please!" he begged. 
Yes, I wanted to say. Anything. But I couldn't find my lips. 

"Carlisle!" the angel called, agony in his perfect voice. "Bella, Bella, no, oh please, no, no!" And the angel 
was sobbing tearless, broken sobs. 

The angel shouldn't weep, it was wrong. I tried to find him, to tell him everything was fine, but the water 
was so deep, it was pressing on me, and I couldn't breathe. 

There was a point of pressure against my head. It hurt. Then, as that pain broke through the darkness to 
me, other pains came, stronger pains. I cried out, gasping, breaking through the dark pool. 

"Bella!" the angel cried. 

"She's lost some blood, but the head wound isn't deep," a calm voice informed me. "Watch out for her 
leg, it's broken." 

A howl of rage strangled on the angel's hps. 

I felt a sharp stab in my side. This couldn't be heaven, could it? There was too much pain for that. 
"Some ribs, too, I think," the methodical voice continued. 

But the sharp pains were fading. There was a new pain, a scalding pain in my hand that was 
overshadowing everything else. 



Someone was burning me. 

"Edward." I tried to tell him, but my voice was so heavy and slow. I couldn't understand myself. 

"Bella, you're going to be fine. Can you hear me, Bella? I love you." 

"Edward," I tried again. My voice was a little clearer. 

"Yes, I'm here." 

"It hurts," I whimpered. 

"I know, Bella, I know" — and then, away from me, anguished — "can't you do anything?" 
"My bag, please. . . Hold your breath, Alice, it will help," Carlisle promised. 
"Alice?" I groaned. 

"She's here, she knew where to find you." 
"My hand hurts," I tried to tell him. 

"I know, Bella. Carlisle will give you something, it will stop." 

"My hand is burning!" I screamed, finally breaking through the last of the darkness, my eyes fluttering 
open. I couldn't see his face, something dark and warm was clouding my eyes. Why couldn't they see the 
fire and put it out? 

His voice was frightened. "Bella?" 

"The fire! Someone stop the fire!" I screamed as it burned me. 
"Carlisle! Her hand!" 

"He bit her." Carlisle's voice was no longer calm, it was appalled. 
I heard Edward catch his breath in horror. 

"Edward, you have to do it." It was Alice's voice, close by my head. Cool fingers brushed at the wetness 
in my eyes. 

"No!" he bellowed. 

"Alice," I moaned. 

"There may be a chance," Carlisle said. 
"What?" Edward begged. 

"See if you can suck the venom back out. The wound is fairly clean." As Carlisle spoke, I could feel 
more pressure on my head, something poking and pulling at my scalp. The pain of it was lost in the pain 
of the fire. 

"Will that work?" Alice's voice was strained. 

"I don't know," Carlisle said. "But we have to hurry." 



"Carlisle, I. . ." Edward hesitated. "I don't know if I can do that." There was agony in his beautiful voice 
again. 

"It's your decision, Edward, either way. I can't help you. I have to get this bleeding stopped here if you're 
going to be taking blood from her hand." 

I writhed in the grip of the fiery torture, the movement making the pain in my leg flare sickeningly. 

"Edward!" I screamed. I realized my eyes were closed again. I opened them, desperate to find his face. 
And I found him. Finally, I could see his perfect face, staring at me, twisted into a mask of indecision and 
pain. 

"Alice, get me something to brace her leg!" Carlisle was bent over me, working on my head. "Edward, 
you must do it now, or it will be too late." 

Edward's face was drawn. I watched his eyes as the doubt was suddenly replaced with a blazing 
determination. His jaw tightened. I felt his cool, strong fingers on my burning hand, locking it in place. 
Then his head bent over it, and his cold hps pressed against my skin. 

At first the pain was worse. I screamed and thrashed against the cool hands that held me back. I heard 
Alice's voice, trying to calm me. Something heavy held my leg to the floor, and Carlisle had my head 
locked in the vise of his stone arms. 

Then, slowly, my writhing calmed as my hand grew more and more numb. The fire was dulling, focusing 
into an ever-smaller point. 

I felt my consciousness slipping as the pain subsided. I was afraid to fall into the black waters again, 
afraid I would lose him in the darkness. 

"Edward," I tried to say, but I couldn't hear my voice. They could hear me. 

"He's right here, Bella." 

"Stay, Edward, stay with me..." 

"I will." His voice was strained, but somehow triumphant. 

I sighed contentedly. The fire was gone, the other pains dulled by a sleepiness seeping through my body. 

"Is it all out?" Carlisle asked from somewhere far away. 

"Her blood tastes clean," Edward said quietiy. "I can taste the morphine." 

"Bella?" Carlisle called to me. 

I tried to answer. "Mrnmmm?" 

"Is the fire gone?" 

"Yes," I sighed. "Thank you, Edward." 
"I love you," he answered. 
"I know," I breathed, so tired. 

I heard my favorite sound in the world: Edward's quiet laugh, weak with relief. 



"Bella?" Carlisle asked again. 

I frowned; I wanted to sleep. "What?" 

"Where is your mother?" 

"In Florida," I sighed. "He tricked me, Edward. He watched our videos." The outrage in my voice was 
pitifully frail. 

But that reminded me. 

"Alice." I tried to open my eyes. "Alice, the video — he knew you, Alice, he knew where you came 
from." I meant to speak urgently, but my voice was feeble. "I smell gasoline," I added, surprised through 
the haze in my brain. 

"It's time to move her," Carlisle said. 

"No, I want to sleep," I complained. 

"You can sleep, sweetheart, I'll carry you," Edward soothed me. 

And I was in his arms, cradled against his chest — floating, all the pain gone. 

"Sleep now, Bella" were the last words I heard. 

24. AN IMPASSE 



My eyes opened to a bright, white light. I was in an unfamiliar room, a white room. The wall beside me 
was covered in long vertical blinds; over my head, the glaring lights blinded me. I was propped up on a 
hard, uneven bed — a bed with rails. The pillows were flat and lumpy. There was an annoying beeping 
sound somewhere close by. I hoped that meant I was still alive. Death shouldn't be this uncomfortable. 

My hands were all twisted up with clear tubes, and something was taped across my face, under my nose. 
I lifted my hand to rip it off. 

"No, you don't." And cool fingers caught my hand. 

"Edward?" I turned my head slightly, and his exquisite face was just inches from mine, his chin resting on 
the edge of my pillow. I realized again that I was alive, this time with gratitude and elation. "Oh, Edward, 
I'm so sorry!" 

"Shhhh," he shushed me. "Everything's all right now." 

"What happened?" I couldn't remember clearly, and my mind rebelled against me as I tried to recall. 
"I was almost too late. I could have been too late," he whispered, his voice tormented. 
"I was so stupid, Edward. I thought he had my mom." 
"He tricked us all." 

"I need to call Charlie and my mom," I realized through the haze. 



"Alice called them. Renee is here — well, here in the hospital. She's getting something to eat right now." 

"She's here?" I tried to sit up, but the spinning in my head accelerated, and his hand pushed me gently 
down onto the pillows. 

"She'll be back soon," he promised. "And you need to stay still." 

"But what did you tell her?" I panicked. I had no interest in being soothed. My mom was here and / was 
recovering from a vampire attack. "Why did you tell her I'm here?" 

"You fell down two flights of stairs and through a window." He paused. "You have to admit, it could 
happen." 

I sighed, and it hurt. I stared down at my body under the sheet, the huge lump that was my leg. 
"How bad am I?" I asked. 

"You have a broken leg, four broken ribs, some cracks in your skull, bruises covering every inch of your 
skin, and you've lost a lot of blood. They gave you a few transfusions. I didn't like it — it made you smell 
all wrong for a while." 

"That must have been a nice change for you." 
"No, I like how you smell." 

"How did you do it?" I asked quietly. He knew what I meant at once. 

"I'm not sure." He looked away from my wondering eyes, hfting my gauze- wrapped hand from the bed 
and holding it gently in his, careful not to disrupt the wire connecting me to one of the monitors. 

I waited patiently for the rest. 

He sighed without returning my gaze. "It was impossible. . . to stop," he whispered. "Impossible. But I 
did." He looked up finally, with half a smile. "I must love you." 

"Don't I taste as good as I smell?" I smiled in response. That hurt my face. 

"Even better — better than I'd imagined." 

"I'm sorry," I apologized. 

He raised his eyes to the ceiling. "Of all the things to apologize for." 

"What should I apologize for?" 

"For very nearly taking yourself away from me forever." 

"I'm sorry," I apologized again. 

"I know why you did it." His voice was comforting. "It was still irrational, of course. You should have 
waited for me, you should have told me." 

"You wouldn't have let me go." 

"No," he agreed in a grim tone, "I wouldn't." 



Some very unpleasant memories were beginning to come back to me. I shuddered, and then winced. 
He was instantly anxious. "Bella, what's wrong?" 
"What happened to James?" 

"After I pulled him off you, Emmett and Jasper took care of him." There was a fierce note of regret in his 
voice. 

This confused me. "I didn't see Emmett and Jasper there." 
"They had to leave the room. . . there was a lot of blood." 
"But you stayed." 
"Yes, I stayed." 

"And Alice, and Carlisle. . . " I said in wonder. 
"They love you, too, you know." 

A flash of painful images from the last time I'd seen Alice reminded me of something. "Did Alice see the 
tape?" I asked anxiously. 

"Yes." A new sound darkened his voice, a tone of sheer hatred. 

"She was always in the dark, that's why she didn't remember." 

"I know. She understands now." His voice was even, but his face was black with fury. 

I tried to reach his face with my free hand, but something stopped me. I glanced down to see the IV 
pulling at my hand. 

"Ugh." I winced. 

"What is it?" he asked anxiously — distracted, but not enough. The bleakness did not entirely leave his 
eyes. 

"Needles," I explained, looking away from the one in my hand. I concentrated on a warped ceiling tile 
and tried to breathe deeply despite the ache in my ribs. 

"Afraid of a needle," he muttered to himself under his breath, shaking his head. "Oh, a sadistic vampire, 
intent on torturing her to death, sure, no problem, she runs off to meet him. An IV, on the other hand. . . " 

I rolled my eyes. I was pleased to discover that this reaction, at least, was pain-free. I decided to change 
the subject. 

"Why are you here?" I asked. 

He stared at me, first confusion and then hurt touching his eyes. His brows pulled together as he frowned. 
"Do you want me to leave?" 

"No!" I protested, horrified by the thought. "No, I meant, why does my mother think you're here? I need 
to have my story straight before she gets back." 

"Oh," he said, and his forehead smoothed back into marble. "I came to Phoenix to talk some sense into 



you, to convince you to come back to Forks." His wide eyes were so earnest and sincere, I almost 
believed him myself. "You agreed to see me, and you drove out to the hotel where I was staying with 
Carlisle and Alice — of course I was here with parental supervision," he inserted virtuously, "but you 
tripped on the stairs on the way to my room and. . . well, you know the rest. You don't need to remember 
any details, though; you have a good excuse to be a little muddled about the finer points." 

I thought about it for a moment. "There are a few flaws with that story. Like no broken windows." 

"Not really," he said. "Alice had a little bit too much fun fabricating evidence. It's all been taken care of 
very convincingly — you could probably sue the hotel if you wanted to. You have nothing to worry 
about," he promised, stroking my cheek with the lightest of touches. "Your only job now is to heal." 

I wasn't so lost to the soreness or the fog of medication that I didn't respond to his touch. The beeping of 
the monitor jumped around erratically — now he wasn't the only one who could hear my heart 
misbehave. 

"That's going to be embarrassing," I muttered to myself. 

He chuckled, and a speculative look came into his eye. "Hmm, I wonder. 

He leaned in slowly; the beeping noise accelerated wildly before his hps even touched me. But when they 
did, though with the most gentle of pressure, the beeping stopped altogether. 

He pulled back abruptly, his anxious expression turning to relief as the monitor reported the restarting of 
my heart. 

"It seems that I'm going to have to be even more careful with you than usual." He frowned. 

"I was not finished kissing you," I complained. "Don't make me come over there." 

He grinned, and bent to press his hps lightly to mine. The monitor went wild. 

But then his lips were taut. He pulled away. 

"I think I hear your mother," he said, grinning again. 

"Don't leave me," I cried, an irrational surge of panic flooding through me. I couldn't let him go — he 
might disappear from me again. 

He read the terror in my eyes for a short second. "I won't," he promised solemnly, and then he smiled. 
"I'll take a nap." 

He moved from the hard plastic chair by my side to the turquoise faux-leather recliner at the foot of my 
bed, leaning it all the way back, and closing his eyes. He was perfectly still. 

"Don't forget to breathe," I whispered sarcastically. He took a deep breath, his eyes still closed. 

I could hear my mother now. She was talking to someone, maybe a nurse, and she sounded tired and 
upset. I wanted to jump out of the bed and run to her, to calm her, promise that everything was fine. But 
I wasn't in any sort of shape for jumping, so I waited impatientiy. 

The door opened a crack, and she peeked through. 

"Mom!" I whispered, my voice full of love and relief. 



She took in Edward's still form on the recliner, and tiptoed to my bedside. 
"He never leaves, does he?" she mumbled to herself. 
"Mom, I'm so glad to see you!" 

She bent down to hug me gently, and I felt warm tears falling on my cheeks. 
"Bella, I was so upset!" 

"I'm sorry, Mom. But everything's fine now, it's okay," I comforted her. 

"I'm just glad to finally see your eyes open." She sat on the edge of my bed. 

I suddenly realized I didn't have any idea when it was. "How long have they been closed?" 

"It's Friday, hon, you've been out for a while." 

"Friday?" I was shocked. I tried to remember what day it had been when. . . but I didn't want to think 
about that. 

"They had to keep you sedated for a while, honey — you've got a lot of injuries." 
"I know." I could feel them. 

"You're lucky Dr. Cullen was there. He's such a nice man. . . very young, though. And he looks more like 
a model than a doctor. . . " 

"You met Carlisle?" 

"And Edward's sister Alice. She's a lovely girl." 
"She is," I agreed wholeheartedly. 

She glanced over her shoulder at Edward, lying with his eyes closed in the chair. "You didn't tell me you 
had such good friends in Forks." 

I cringed, and then moaned. 

"What hurts?" she demanded anxiously, turning back to me. Edward's eyes flashed to my face. 

"It's fine," I assured them. "I just have to remember not to move." He lapsed back into his phony slumber. 

I took advantage of my mother's momentary distraction to keep the subject from returning to my 
less-than-candid behavior. "Where's Phil?" I asked quickly. 

"Florida — oh, Bella ! You'll never guess ! Just when we were about to leave, the best news ! " 
"Phil got signed?" I guessed. 

"Yes! How did you guess! The Suns, can you believe it?" 

"That's great, Mom," I said as enthusiastically as I could manage, though I had little idea what that meant. 

"And you'll like Jacksonville so much," she gushed while I stared at her vacantly. "I was a little bit worried 
when Phil started talking about Akron, what with the snow and everything, because you know how I hate 



the cold, but now Jacksonville! It's always sunny, and the humidity really isn't that bad. We found the 
cutest house, yellow, with white trim, and a porch just like in an old movie, and this huge oak tree, and 
it's just a few minutes from the ocean, and you'll have your own bathroom — " 

"Wait, Mom!" I interrupted. Edward still had his eyes closed, but he looked too tense to pass as asleep. 
"What are you talking about? I'm not going to Florida. I live in Forks." 

"But you don't have to anymore, silly," she laughed. "Phil will be able to be around so much more now. . . 
we've talked about it a lot, and what I'm going to do is trade off on the away games, half the time with 
you, half the time with him." 

"Mom." I hesitated, wondering how best to be diplomatic about this. "I want to live in Forks. I'm already 
settled in at school, and I have a couple of girlfriends" — she glanced toward Edward again when I 
reminded her of friends, so I tried another direction — "and Charlie needs me. He's just all alone up 
there, and he can't cook at all." 

"You want to stay in Forks?" she asked, bewildered. The idea was inconceivable to her. And then her 
eyes flickered back toward Edward. "Why?" 

"I told you — school, Charlie — ouch!" I'd shrugged. Not a good idea. 

Her hands fluttered helplessly over me, trying to find a safe place to pat. She made do with my forehead; 
it was unbandaged. 

"Bella, honey, you hate Forks," she reminded me. 
"It's not so bad." 

She frowned and looked back and forth between Edward and me, this time very deliberately. 
"Is it this boy?" she whispered. 

I opened my mouth to lie, but her eyes were scrutinizing my face, and I knew she would see through that. 

"He's part of it," I admitted. No need to confess how big a part. "So, have you had a chance to talk with 
Edward?" I asked. 

"Yes." She hesitated, looking at his perfectly still form. "And I want to talk to you about that." 
Uh-oh. "What about?" I asked. 

"I think that boy is in love with you," she accused, keeping her voice low. 
"I think so, too," I confided. 

"And how do you feel about him?" She only poorly concealed the raging curiosity in her voice. 

I sighed, looking away. As much as I loved my mom, this was not a conversation I wanted to have with 
her. "I'm pretty crazy about him." There — that sounded like something a teenager with her first 
boyfriend might say. 

"Well, he seems very nice, and, my goodness, he's incredibly good-looking, but you're so young, 
Bella. . . " Her voice was unsure; as far as I could remember, this was the first time since I was eight that 
she'd come close to trying to sound like a parental authority. I recognized the reasonable-but-firm tone of 
voice from talks I'd had with her about men. 



"I know that, Mom. Don't worry about it. It's just a crush," I soothed her. 
"That's right," she agreed, easily pleased. 

Then she sighed and glanced guiltily over her shoulder at the big, round clock on the wall. 
"Do you need to go?" 

She bit her lip. "Phil's supposed to call in a little while. . . I didn't know you were going to wake up ... " 

"No problem, Mom." I tried to tone down the relief so she wouldn't get her feelings hurt. "I won't be 
alone." 

"I'll be back soon. I've been sleeping here, you know," she announced, proud of herself. 

"Oh, Mom, you don't have to do that! You can sleep at home — I'll never notice." The swirl of 
painkillers in my brain was making it hard to concentrate even now, though, apparently, I'd been sleeping 
for days. 

"I was too nervous," she admitted sheepishly. "There's been some crime in the neighborhood, and I don't 
like being there alone." 

"Crime?" I asked in alarm. 

"Someone broke into that dance studio around the comer from the house and burned it to the ground — 
there's nothing left at all! And they left a stolen car right out front. Do you remember when you used to 
dance there, honey?" 

"I remember." I shivered, and winced. 

"I can stay, baby, if you need me." 

"No, Mom, I'll be fine. Edward will be with me." 

She looked like that might be why she wanted to stay. "I'll be back tonight." It sounded as much like a 
warning as it sounded like a promise, and she glanced at Edward again as she said it. 

"I love you, Mom." 

"I love you, too, Bella. Try to be more careful when you walk, honey, I don't want to lose you." 
Edward's eyes stayed closed, but a wide grin flashed across his face. 

A nurse came bustling in then to check all my tubes and wires. My mother kissed my forehead, patted 
my gauze- wrapped hand, and left. 

The nurse was checking the paper readout on my heart monitor. 
"Are you feeling anxious, honey? Your heart rate got a little high there." 
"I'm fine," I assured her. 

"I'll tell your RN that you're awake. She'll be in to see you in a minute." 
As soon as she closed the door, Edward was at my side. 



"You stole a car?" I raised my eyebrows. 

He smiled, unrepentant. "It was a good car, very fast." 

"How was your nap?" I asked. 

"Interesting." His eyes narrowed. 

"What?" 

He looked down while he answered. "I'm surprised. I thought Florida. . . and your mother. . . well, I 
thought that's what you would want." 

I stared at him uncomprehendingly. "But you'd be stuck inside all day in Florida. You'd only be able to 
come out at night, just like a real vampire." 

He almost smiled, but not quite. And then his face was grave. "I would stay in Forks, Bella. Or 
somewhere like it," he explained. "Someplace where I couldn't hurt you anymore." 

It didn't sink in at first. I continued to stare at him blankly as the words one by one clicked into place in 
my head like a ghastly puzzle. I was barely conscious of the sound of my heart accelerating, though, as 
my breathing became hyperventilation, I was aware of the sharp aching in my protesting ribs. 

He didn't say anything; he watched my face warily as the pain that had nothing to do with broken bones, 
pain that was infinitely worse, threatened to crush me. 

And then another nurse walked purposefully into the room. Edward sat still as stone as she took in my 
expression with a practiced eye before turning to the monitors. 

"Time for more pain meds, sweetheart?" she asked kindly, tapping the IV feed. 

"No, no," I mumbled, trying to keep the agony out of my voice. "I don't need anything." I couldn't afford 
to close my eyes now. 

"No need to be brave, honey. It's better if you don't get too stressed out; you need to rest." She waited, 
but I just shook my head. 

"Okay," she sighed. "Hit the call button when you're ready." 

She gave Edward a stern look, and threw one more anxious glance at the machinery, before leaving. 

His cool hands were on my face; I stared at him with wild eyes. 

"Shhh, Bella, calm down." 

"Don't leave me," I begged in a broken voice. 

"I won't," he promised. "Now relax before I call the nurse back to sedate you." 
But my heart couldn't slow. 

"Bella." He stroked my face anxiously. "I'm not going anywhere. I'll be right here as long as you need 
me." 

"Do you swear you won't leave me?" I whispered. I tried to control the gasping, at least. My ribs were 
throbbing. 



He put his hands on either side of my face and brought his face close to mine. His eyes were wide and 
serious. "I swear." 

The smell of his breath was soothing. It seemed to ease the ache of my breathing. He continued to hold 
my gaze while my body slowly relaxed and the beeping returned to a normal pace. His eyes were dark, 
closer to black than gold today. 

"Better?" he asked. 

"Yes," I said cautiously. 

He shook his head and muttered something unintelligible. I thought I picked out the word "overreaction." 

"Why did you say that?" I whispered, trying to keep my voice from shaking. "Are you tired of having to 
save me all the time? Do you want me to go away?" 

"No, I don't want to be without you, Bella, of course not. Be rational. And I have no problem with saving 
you, either — if it weren't for the fact that I was the one putting you in danger. . . that I'm the reason that 
you're here." 

"Yes, you are the reason." I frowned. "The reason I'm here — alive." 

"Barely." His voice was just a whisper. "Covered in gauze and plaster and hardly able to move." 

"I wasn't referring to my most recent near-death experience," I said, growing irritated. "I was thinking of 
the others — you can take your pick. If it weren't for you, I would be rotting away in the Forks 
cemetery." 

He winced at my words, but the haunted look didn't leave his eyes. 

"That's not the worst part, though," he continued to whisper. He acted as if I hadn't spoken. "Not seeing 
you there on the floor. . . crumpled and broken." His voice was choked. "Not thinking I was too late. Not 
even hearing you scream in pain — all those unbearable memories that I'll carry with me for the rest of 
eternity. No, the very worst was feeling. . . knowing that I couldn't stop. Believing that I was going to kill 
you myself." 

"But you didn't." 

"I could have. So easily." 

I knew I needed to stay calm. . . but he was trying to talk himself into leaving me, and the panic fluttered 
in my lungs, trying to get out. 

"Promise me," I whispered. 

"What?" 

"You know what." I was starting to get angry now. He was so stubbornly determined to dwell on the 
negative. 

He heard the change in my tone. His eyes tightened. "I don't seem to be strong enough to stay away from 
you, so I suppose that you'll get your way. . . whether it kills you or not," he added roughly. 

"Good." He hadn't promised, though — a fact that I had not missed. The panic was only barely 
contained; I had no strength left to control the anger. "You told me how you stopped. . . now I want to 



know why," I demanded. 



"Why?" he repeated warily. 

"Why you did it. Why didn't you just let the venom spread? By now I would be just like you." 

Edward's eyes seemed to turn flat black, and I remembered that this was something he'd never intended 
me to know. Alice must have been preoccupied by the things she'd learned about herself. . . or she'd been 
very careful with her thoughts around him — clearly, he'd had no idea that she'd filled me in on the 
mechanics of vampire conversions. He was surprised, and infuriated. His nostrils flared, his mouth looked 
as if it was chiseled from stone. 

He wasn't going to answer, that much was clear. 

"I'll be the first to admit that I have no experience with relationships," I said. "But it just seems logical. . . a 
man and woman have to be somewhat equal. . . as in, one of them can't always be swooping in and 
saving the other one. They have to save each other equally." 

He folded his arms on the side of my bed and rested his chin on his arms. His expression was smooth, 
the anger reined in. Evidently he'd decided he wasn't angry with me. I hoped I'd get a chance to warn 
Alice before he caught up with her. 

"You have saved me," he said quietiy. 

"I can't always be Lois Lane," I insisted. "I want to be Superman, too." 

"You don't know what you're asking." His voice was soft; he stared intentiy at the edge of the pillowcase. 
"I think I do." 

"Bella, you don 't know. I've had almost ninety years to think about this, and I'm still not sure." 
"Do you wish that Carlisle hadn't saved you?" 

"No, I don't wish that." He paused before continuing. "But my life was over. I wasn't giving anything up." 

"You are my life. You're the only thing it would hurt me to lose." I was getting better at this. It was easy 
to admit how much I needed him. 

He was very calm, though. Decided. 

"I can't do it, Bella. I won't do that to you." 

"Why not?" My throat rasped and the words weren't as loud as I'd meant them to be. "Don't tell me it's 
too hard! After today, or I guess it was a few days ago. . . anyway, after that, it should be nothing." 

He glared at me. 

"And the pain?" he asked. 

I blanched. I couldn't help it. But I tried to keep my expression from showing how clearly I remembered 
the feeling. . . the fire in my veins. 

"That's my problem," I said. "I can handle it." 



"It's possible to take bravery to the point where it becomes insanity." 



"It's not an issue. Three days. Big deal." 

Edward grimaced again as my words reminded him that I was more informed than he had ever intended 
me to be. I watched him repress the anger, watched as his eyes grew speculative. 

"Charlie?" he asked curtly. "Renee?" 

Minutes passed in silence as I struggled to answer his question. I opened my mouth, but no sound came 
out. I closed it again. He waited, and his expression became triumphant because he knew I had no true 
answer. 

"Look, that's not an issue either," I finally muttered; my voice was as unconvincing as it always was when 
I lied. "Renee has always made the choices that work for her — she'd want me to do the same. And 
Charlie's resilient, he's used to being on his own. I can't take care of them forever. I have my own life to 
live." 

"Exactly," he snapped. "And I won't end it for you." 

"If you're waiting for me to be on my deathbed, I've got news for you! I was just there!" 
"You're going to recover," he reminded me. 

I took a deep breath to calm myself, ignoring the spasm of pain it triggered. I stared at him, and he stared 
back. There was no compromise in his face. 

"No," I said slowly. "I'm not." 

His forehead creased. "Of course you are. You may have a scar or two. . . " 
"You're wrong," I insisted. "I'm going to die." 

"Really, Bella." He was anxious now. "You'll be out of here in a few days. Two week at most." 

I glared at him. "I may not die now. . . but I'm going to die sometime. Every minute of the day, I get 
closer. And I'm going to get old" 

He frowned as what I was saying sunk in, pressing his long lingers to his temples and closing his eyes. 
"That's how it's supposed to happen. How it should happen. How it would have happened if I didn't exist 
— and / shouldn 't exist" 

I snorted. He opened his eyes in surprise. "That's stupid. That's like going to someone who's just won the 
lottery, taking their money, and saying, 'Look, let's just go back to how things should be. It's better that 
way.' And I'm not buying it." 

"I'm hardly a lottery prize," he growled. 

"That's right. You're much better." 

He rolled his eyes and set his hps. "Bella, we're not having this discussion anymore. I refuse to damn you 
to an eternity of night and that's the end of it." 

"If you think that's the end, then you don't know me very well," I warned him. "You're not the only 
vampire I know." 

His eyes went black again. "Alice wouldn't dare." 



And for a moment he looked so frightening that I couldn't help but believe it — I couldn't imagine 
someone brave enough to cross him. 

"Alice already saw it, didn't she?" I guessed. "That's why the things she says upset you. She knows I'm 
going to be like you. . . someday." 

"She's wrong. She also saw you dead, but that didn't happen, either." 
"You'll never catch me betting against Alice." 

We stared at each other for a very long time. It was quiet except for the whirring of the machines, the 
beeping, the dripping, the ticking of the big clock on the wall. Finally, his expression softened. 

"So where does that leave us?" I wondered. 

He chuckled humorlessly. "I believe it's called an impasse" 

I sighed. "Ouch," I muttered. 

"How are you feeling?" he asked, eyeing the button for the nurse. 
'Tm fine," I lied. 

"I don't believe you," he said gently. 

"I'm not going back to sleep." 

"You need rest. All this arguing isn't good for you." 

"So give in," I hinted. 

"Nice try." He reached for the button. 

"No!" 

He ignored me. 

"Yes?" the speaker on the wall squawked. 

"I think we're ready for more pain medication," he said calmly, ignoring my furious expression. 
"I'll send in the nurse." The voice sounded very bored. 
"I won't take it," I promised. 

He looked toward the sack of fluids hanging beside my bed. "I don't think they're going to ask you to 
swallow anything." 

My heart rate started to climb. He read the fear in my eyes, and sighed in frustration. 

"Bella, you're in pain. You need to relax so you can heal. Why are you being so difficult? They're not 
going to put any more needles in you now." 

"I'm not afraid of the needles," I mumbled. "I'm afraid to close my eyes." 

Then he smiled his crooked smile, and took my face between his hands. "I told you I'm not going 



anywhere. Don't be afraid. As long as it makes you happy, I'll be here." 

I smiled back, ignoring the ache in my cheeks. "You're talking about forever, you know." 

"Oh, you'll get over it — it's just a crush." 

I shook my head in disbelief — it made me dizzy. "I was shocked when Renee swallowed that one. I 
know you know better." 

"That's the beautiful thing about being human," he told me. "Things change." 
My eyes narrowed. "Don't hold your breath." 
He was laughing when the nurse came in, brandishing a syringe. 
"Excuse me," she said brusquely to Edward. 

He got up and crossed to the end of the small room, leaning against the wall. He folded his arms and 
waited. I kept my eyes on him, still apprehensive. He met my gaze calmly. 

"Here you go, honey." The nurse smiled as she injected the medicine into my tube. "You'll feel better 
now." 

"Thanks," I mumbled, unenthusiastic. It didn't take long. I could feel the drowsiness trickling through my 
bloodstream almost immediately. 

"That ought to do it," she muttered as my eyelids drooped. 

She must have left the room, because something cold and smooth touched my face. 
"Stay." The word was slurred. 

"I will," he promised. His voice was beautiful, like a lullaby. "Like I said, as long as it makes you happy. . . 
as long as it's what's best for you." 

I tried to shake my head, but it was too heavy. '"S not the same thing," I mumbled. 

He laughed. "Don't worry about that now, Bella. You can argue with me when you wake up." 

I think I smiled. '"Kay." 

I could feel his hps at my ear. 

"I love you," he whispered. 

"Me, too." 

"I know," he laughed quietly. 

I turned my head slightly. . . searching. He knew what I was after. His lips touched mine gentiy. 

"Thanks," I sighed. 

"Anytime." 

I wasn't really there at all anymore. But I fought against the stupor weakly. There was just one more thing 



I wanted to tell him. 

"Edward?" I struggled to pronounce his name clearly. 
"Yes?" 

"I'm betting on Alice," I mumbled. 
And then the night closed over me. 

EPILOGUE:AN OCCASION 



Edward helped me into his car, being very careful of the wisps of silk and chiffon, the flowers he'd just 
pinned into my elaborately styled curls, and my bulky walking cast. He ignored the angry set of my 
mouth. 

When he had me settled, he got in the driver's seat and headed back out the long, narrow drive. 

"At what point exactly are you going to tell me what's going on?" I asked grumpily. I really hated 
surprises. And he knew that. 

"I'm shocked that you haven't figured it out yet." He threw a mocking smile in my direction, and my 
breath caught in my throat. Would I ever get used to his perfection? 

"I did mention that you looked very nice, didn't I?" I verified. 

"Yes." He grinned again. I'd never seen him dress in black before, and, with the contrast against his pale 
skin, his beauty was absolutely surreal. That much I couldn't deny, even if the fact that he was wearing a 
tuxedo made me very nervous. 

Not quite as nervous as the dress. Or the shoe. Only one shoe, as my other foot was still securely 
encased in plaster. But the stiletto heel, held on only by satin ribbons, certainly wasn't going to help me as 
I tried to hobble around. 

"I'm not coming over anymore if Alice is going to treat me like Guinea Pig Barbie when I do," I griped. 
I'd spent the better part of the day in Alice's staggeringly vast bathroom, a helpless victim as she played 
hairdresser and cosmetician. Whenever I fidgeted or complained, she reminded me that she didn't have 
any memories of being human, and asked me not to ruin her vicarious fun. Then she'd dressed me in the 
most ridiculous dress — deep blue, frilly and off the shoulders, with French tags I couldn't read — a 
dress more suitable for a runway than Forks. Nothing good could come of our formal attire, of that I was 
sure. Unless. . . but I was afraid to put my suspicions into words, even in my own head. 

I was distracted then by the sound of a phone ringing. Edward pulled his cell phone from a pocket inside 
his jacket, looking briefly at the caller ID before answering. 

"Hello, Charlie," he said warily. 

"Charlie?" I frowned. 

Charlie had been. . . difficult since my return to Forks. He had compartmentalized my bad experience into 
two defined reactions. Toward Carlisle he was almost worshipfully grateful. On the other hand, he was 



stubbornly convinced that Edward was at fault — because, if not for him, I wouldn't have left home in the 
first place. And Edward was far from disagreeing with him. These days I had rules that hadn't existed 
before: curfews. . . visiting hours. 

Something Charlie was saying made Edward's eyes widen in disbelief, and then a grin spread across his 
face. 

"You're kidding!" He laughed. 
"What is it?" I demanded. 

He ignored me. "Why don't you let me talk to him?" Edward suggested with evident pleasure. He waited 
for a few seconds. 

"Hello, Tyler, this is Edward Cullen." His voice was very friendly, on the surface. I knew it well enough to 
catch the soft edge of menace. What was Tyler doing at my house? The awful truth began to dawn on 
me. I looked again at the inappropriate dress Alice had forced me into. 

"I'm sorry if there's been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella is unavailable tonight." Edward's tone 
changed, and the threat in his voice was suddenly much more evident as he continued. "To be perfectiy 
honest, she'll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself is concerned. No offense. And 
I'm sorry about your evening." He didn't sound sorry at all. And then he snapped the phone shut, a huge 
smirk on his face. 

My face and neck flushed crimson with anger. I could feel the rage-induced tears starting to fill my eyes. 
He looked at me in surprise. "Was that last part a bit too much? I didn't mean to offend you." 
I ignored that. 

"You're taking me to the prom !" I yelled. 

It was embarrassingly obvious now. If I'd been paying any attention at all, I'm sure I would have noticed 
the date on the posters that decorated the school buildings. But I'd never dreamed he was thinking of 
subjecting me to this. Didn't he know me at all? 

He wasn't expecting the force of my reaction, that was clear. He pressed his lips together and his eyes 
narrowed. "Don't be difficult, Bella." 

My eyes flashed to the window; we were halfway to the school already. 
"Why are you doing this to me?" I demanded in horror. 

He gestured to his tuxedo. "Honestly, Bella, what did you think we were doing?" 

I was mortified. First, because I'd missed the obvious. And also because the vague suspicions — 
expectations, really — that I'd been forming all day, as Alice tried to transform me into a beauty queen, 
were so far wide of the mark. My half-f earful hopes seemed very silly now. 

I'd guessed there was some kind of occasion brewing. But prom ! That was the furthest thing from my 
mind. 

The angry tears rolled over my cheeks. I remembered with dismay that I was very uncharacteristically 
wearing mascara. I wiped quickly under my eyes to prevent any smudges. My hand was unblackened 
when I pulled it away; maybe Alice had known I would need waterproof makeup. 



"This is completely ridiculous. Why are you crying?" he demanded in frustration. 
"Because I'm mad !" 

"Bella." He turned the full force of his scorching golden eyes on me. 
"What?" I muttered, distracted. 
"Humor me," he insisted. 

His eyes were melting all my fury. It was impossible to fight with him when he cheated like that. I gave in 
with poor grace. 

"Fine," I pouted, unable to glare as effectively as I would have liked. "I'll go quietiy. But you'll see. I'm 
way overdue for more bad luck. I'll probably break my other leg. Look at this shoe! It's a death trap!" I 
held out my good leg as evidence. 

"Hmmm." He stared at my leg longer than was necessary. "Remind me to thank Alice for that tonight." 
"Alice is going to be there?" That comforted me slightly. 
"With Jasper, and Emmett. . . and Rosalie," he admitted. 

The feeling of comfort disappeared. There had been no progress with Rosalie, though I was on quite 
good terms with her sometimes-husband. Emmett enjoyed having me around — he thought my bizarre 
human reactions were hilarious. . . or maybe it was just the fact that I fell down a lot that he found so 
funny. Rosalie acted as if I didn't exist. While I shook my head to dispel the direction my thoughts had 
taken, I thought of something else. 

"Is Charlie in on this?" I asked, suddenly suspicious. 

"Of course." He grinned, and then chuckled. "Apparently Tyler wasn't, though." 

I gritted my teeth. How Tyler could be so delusional, I couldn't imagine. At school, where Charlie 
couldn't interfere, Edward and I were inseparable — except for those rare sunny days. 

We were at the school now; Rosalie's red convertible was conspicuous in the parking lot. The clouds 
were thin today, a few streaks of sunlight escaping through far away in the west. 

He got out and walked around the car to open my door. He held out his hand. 

I sat stubbornly in my seat, arms folded, feeling a secret twinge of smugness. The lot was crowded with 
people in formal dress: witnesses. He couldn't remove me forcibly from the car as he might have if we'd 
been alone. 

He sighed. "When someone wants to kill you, you're brave as a Hon — and then when someone mentions 
dancing. . ." He shook his head. 

I gulped. Dancing. 

"Bella, I won't let anything hurt you — not even yourself. I won't let go of you once, I promise." 

I thought about that and suddenly felt much better. He could see that in my face. 

"There, now," he said gently, "it won't be so bad." He leaned down and wrapped one arm around my 



waist. I took his other hand and let him lift me from the car. 

He kept his arm tightly around me, supporting me as I limped toward the school. 

In Phoenix, they held proms in hotel ballrooms. This dance was in the gym, of course. It was probably 
the only room in town big enough for a dance. When we got inside, I giggled. There were actual balloon 
arches and twisted garlands of pastel crepe paper festooning the walls. 

"This looks like a horror movie waiting to happen," I snickered. 

"Well," he muttered as we slowly approached the ticket table — he was carrying most of my weight, but 
I still had to shuffle and wobble my feet forward — "there are more than enough vampires present." 

I looked at the dance floor; a wide gap had formed in the center of the floor, where two couples whirled 
gracefully. The other dancers pressed to the sides of the room to give them space — no one wanted to 
stand in contrast with such radiance. Emmett and Jasper were intimidating and flawless in classic tuxedos. 
Alice was striking in a black satin dress with geometric cutouts that bared large triangles of her snowy 
white skin. And Rosalie was. . . well, Rosalie. She was beyond belief. Her vivid scarlet dress was 
backless, tight to her calves where it flared into a wide ruffled train, with a neckline that plunged to her 
waist. I pitied every girl in the room, myself included. 

"Do you want me to bolt the doors so you can massacre the unsuspecting townsfolk?" I whispered 
conspiratorially. 

"And where do you fit into that scheme?" He glared. 

"Oh, I'm with the vampires, of course." 

He smiled reluctantiy. "Anything to get out of dancing." 

"Anything." 

He bought our tickets, then turned me toward the dance floor. I cringed against his arm and dragged my 
feet. 

"I've got all night," he warned. 

Eventually he towed me out to where his family was twirling elegantly — if in a style totally unsuitable to 
the present time and music. I watched in horror. 

"Edward." My throat was so dry I could only manage a whisper. "I honestly can't dance!" I could feel 
the panic bubbling up inside my chest. 

"Don't worry, silly," he whispered back. "I can." He put my arms around his neck and lifted me to slide 
his feet under mine. 

And then we were whirling, too. 

"I feel like I'm five years old," I laughed after a few minutes of effortless waltzing. 

"You don't look five," he murmured, pulling me closer for a second, so that my feet were briefly a foot 
from the ground. 

Alice caught my eye on a turn and smiled in encouragement — I smiled back. I was surprised to realize 
that I was actually enjoying myself. . . a little. 



"Okay, this isn't half bad," I admitted. 

But Edward was staring toward the doors, and his face was angry. 

"What is it?" I wondered aloud. I followed his gaze, disoriented by the spinning, but finally I could see 
what was bothering him. Jacob Black, not in a tux, but in a long-sleeved white shirt and tie, his hair 
smoothed back into his usual ponytail, was crossing the floor toward us. 

After the first shock of recognition, I couldn't help but feel bad for Jacob. He was clearly uncomfortable 
— excruciatingly so. His face was apologetic as his eyes met mine. 

Edward snarled very quietiy. 

"Behave \" I hissed. 

Edward's voice was scathing. "He wants to chat with you." 

Jacob reached us then, the embarrassment and apology even more evident on his face. 

"Hey, Bella, I was hoping you would be here." Jacob sounded like he'd been hoping the exact opposite. 
But his smile was just as warm as ever. 

"Hi, Jacob." I smiled back. "What's up?" 

"Can I cut in?" he asked tentatively, glancing at Edward for the first time. I was shocked to notice that 
Jacob didn't have to look up. He must have grown half a foot since the first time I'd seen him. 

Edward's face was composed, his expression blank. His only answer was to set me carefully on my feet, 
and take a step back. 

"Thanks," Jacob said amiably. 

Edward just nodded, looking at me intently before he turned to walk away. 
Jacob put his hands on my waist, and I reached up to put my hands on his shoulders. 
"Wow, Jake, how tall are you now?" 
He was smug. "Six-two." 

We weren't really dancing — my leg made that impossible. Instead we swayed awkwardly from side to 
side without moving our feet. It was just as well; the recent growth spurt had left him looking gangly and 
uncoordinated, he was probably no better a dancer than I was. 

"So, how did you end up here tonight?" I asked without true curiosity. Considering Edward's reaction, I 
could guess. 

"Can you believe my dad paid me twenty bucks to come to your prom?" he admitted, slightly ashamed. 

"Yes, I can," I muttered. "Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself, at least. Seen anything you like?" I 
teased, nodding toward a group of girls lined up against the wall like pastel confections. 

"Yeah," he sighed. "But she's taken." 

He glanced down to meet my curious gaze for just a second — then we both looked away, 
embarrassed. 



"You look really pretty, by the way," he added shyly. 

"Urn, thanks. So why did Billy pay you to come here?" I asked quickly, though I knew the answer. 

Jacob didn't seem grateful for the subject change; he looked away, uncomfortable again. "He said it was 
a 'safe' place to talk to you. I swear the old man is losing his mind." 

I joined in his laughter weakly. 

"Anyway, he said that if I told you something, he would get me that master cylinder I need," he confessed 
with a sheepish grin. 

"Tell me, then. I want you to get your car finished." I grinned back. At least Jacob didn't believe any of 
this. It made the situation a bit easier. Against the wall, Edward was watching my face, his own face 
expressionless. I saw a sophomore in a pink dress eyeing him with timid speculation, but he didn't seem 
to be aware of her. 

Jacob looked away again, ashamed. "Don't get mad, okay?" 

"There's no way I'll be mad at you, Jacob," I assured him. "I won't even be mad at Billy. Just say what 
you have to." 

"Well — this is so stupid, I'm sorry, Bella — he wants you to break up with your boyfriend. He asked 
me to tell you 'please.'" He shook his head in disgust. 

"He's still superstitious, eh?" 

"Yeah. He was. . . kind of over the top when you got hurt down in Phoenix. He didn't believe. . . "Jacob 
trailed off self-consciously. 

My eyes narrowed. "I fell." 

"I know that," Jacob said quickly. 

"He thinks Edward had something to do with me getting hurt." It wasn't a question, and despite my 
promise, I was angry. 

Jacob wouldn't meet my eyes. We weren't even bothering to sway to the music, though his hands were 
still on my waist, and mine around his neck. 

"Look, Jacob, I know Billy probably won't believe this, but just so you know" — he looked at me now, 
responding to the new earnestness in my voice — "Edward really did save my life. If it weren't for 
Edward and his father, I'd be dead." 

"I know," he claimed, but he sounded like my sincere words had affected him some. Maybe he'd be able 
to convince Billy of this much, at least. 

"Hey, I'm sorry you had to come do this, Jacob," I apologized. "At any rate, you get your parts, right?" 
"Yeah," he muttered. He was still looking awkward. . . upset. 
"There's more?" I asked in disbelief. 

"Forget it," he mumbled, "I'll get a job and save the money myself." 



I glared at him until he met my gaze. "Just spit it out, Jacob." 
"It's so bad." 

"I don't care. Tell me," I insisted. 

"Okay. . . but, geez, this sounds bad." He shook his head. "He said to tell you, no, to warn you, that — 
and this is his plural, not mine" — he lifted one hand from my waist and made little quotations marks in 
the air — '"We'll be watching.'" He watched warily for my reaction. 

It sounded like something from a mafia movie. I laughed out loud. 

"Sorry you had to do this, Jake," I snickered. 

"I don't mind that much." He grinned in relief. His eyes were appraising as they raked quickly over my 
dress. "So, should I tell him you said to butt the hell out?" he asked hopefully. 

"No," I sighed. "Tell him I said thanks. I know he means well." 

The song ended, and I dropped my arms. 

His hands hesitated at my waist, and he glanced at my bum leg. "Do you want to dance again? Or can I 
help you get somewhere?" 

Edward answered for me. "That's all right, Jacob. I'll take it from here." 
Jacob flinched, and stared wide-eyed at Edward, who stood just beside us. 

"Hey, I didn't see you there," he mumbled. "I guess I'll see you around, Bella." He stepped back, waving 
halfheartedly. 

I smiled. "Yeah, I'll see you later." 

"Sorry," he said again before he turned for the door. 

Edward's arms wound around me as the next song started. It was a little up-tempo for slow dancing, but 
that didn't seem to concern him. I leaned my head against his chest, content. 

"Feeling better?" I teased. 

"Not really," he said tersely. 

"Don't be mad at Billy," I sighed. "He just worries about me for Charlie's sake. It's nothing personal." 
"I'm not mad at Billy," he corrected in a clipped voice. "But his son is irritating me." 
I pulled back to look at him. His face was very serious. 
"Why?" 

"First of all, he made me break my promise." 
I stared at him in confusion. 

He half-smiled. "I promised I wouldn't let go of you tonight," he explained. 



"Oh. Well, I forgive you." 



"Thanks. But there's something else." Edward frowned. 
I waited patientiy. 

"He called you pretty ," he finally continued, his frown deepening. "That's practically an insult, the way 
you look right now. You're much more than beautiful." 

I laughed. "You might be a little biased." 

"I don't think that's it. Besides, I have excellent eyesight." 

We were twirling again, my feet on his as he held me close. 

"So are you going to explain the reason for all of this?" I wondered. 

He looked down at me, confused, and I glared meaningfully at the crepe paper. 

He considered for a moment, and then changed direction, spinning me through the crowd to the back 
door of the gym. I caught a glimpse of Jessica and Mike dancing, staring at me curiously. Jessica waved, 
and I smiled back quickly. Angela was there, too, looking blissfully happy in the arms of little Ben 
Cheney; she didn't look up from his eyes, a head lower than hers. Lee and Samantha, Lauren, glaring 
toward us, with Conner; I could name every face that spiraled past me. And then we were outdoors, in 
the cool, dim light of a fading sunset. 

As soon as we were alone, he swung me up into his arms, and carried me across the dark grounds till he 
reached the bench beneath the shadow of the madrone trees. He sat there, keeping me cradled against 
his chest. The moon was already up, visible through the gauzy clouds, and his face glowed pale in the 
white light. His mouth was hard, his eyes troubled. 

"The point?" I prompted softly. 

He ignored me, staring up at the moon. 

"Twilight, again," he murmured. "Another ending. No matter how perfect the day is, it always has to end." 
"Some things don't have to end," I muttered through my teeth, instantiy tense. 
He sighed. 

"I brought you to the prom," he said slowly, finally answering my question, "because I don't want you to 
miss anything. I don't want my presence to take anything away from you, if I can help it. I want you to 
be human . I want your life to continue as it would have if I'd died in nineteen-eighteen like I should 
have." 

I shuddered at his words, and then shook my head angrily. "In what strange parallel dimension would I 
ever have gone to prom of my own free will? If you weren't a thousand times stronger than me, I would 
never have let you get away with this." 

He smiled briefly, but it didn't touch his eyes. "It wasn't so bad, you said so yourself." 
"That's because I was with you." 

We were quiet for a minute; he stared at the moon and I stared at him. I wished there was some way to 



explain how very uninterested I was in a normal human life. 

"Will you tell me something?" he asked, glancing down at me with a slight smile. 

"Don't I always?" 

"Just promise you'll tell me," he insisted, grinning. 

I knew I was going to regret this almost instantly. "Fine." 

"You seemed honesdy surprised when you figured out that I was taking you here," he began. 
"I was" I interjected. 

"Exactiy," he agreed. "But you must have had some other theory. . . I'm curious — what did you think I 
was dressing you up for?" 

Yes, instant regret. I pursed my lips, hesitating. "I don't want to tell you." 
"You promised," he objected. 
"I know." 

"What's the problem?" 

I knew he thought it was mere embarrassment holding me back. "I think it will make you mad — or sad." 
His brows pulled together over his eyes as he thought that through. "I still want to know. Please?" 
I sighed. He waited. 

"Well. . . I assumed it was some kind of. . . occasion. But I didn't think it would be some trite human 
thing. . . prom!" I scoffed. 

"Human?" he asked flatly. He'd picked up on the key word. 

I looked down at my dress, fidgeting with a stray piece of chiffon. He waited in silence. 

"Okay," I confessed in a rush. "So I was hoping that you might have changed your mind. . . that you were 
going to change me, after all." 

A dozen emotions played across his face. Some I recognized: anger. . . pain. . . and then he seemed to 
collect himself and his expression became amused. 

"You thought that would be a black tie occasion, did you?" he teased, touching the lapel of his tuxedo 
jacket. 

I scowled to hide my embarrassment. "I don't know how these things work. To me, at least, it seems 
more rational than prom does." He was still grinning. "It's not funny," I said. 

"No, you're right, it's not," he agreed, his smile fading. "I'd rather treat it like a joke, though, than believe 
you're serious." 

"But I am serious." 

He sighed deeply. "I know. And you're really that willing?" 



The pain was back in his eyes. I bit my Up and nodded. 

"So ready for this to be the end," he murmured, almost to himself, "for this to be the twilight of your life, 
though your life has barely started. You're ready to give up everything." 

"It's not the end, it's the beginning," I disagreed under my breath. 

"I'm not worth it," he said sadly. 

"Do you remember when you told me that I didn't see myself very clearly?" I asked, raising my 
eyebrows. "You obviously have the same blindness." 

"I know what I am." 

I sighed. 

But his mercurial mood shifted on me. He pursed his hps, and his eyes were probing. He examined my 
face for a long moment. 

"You're ready now, then?" he asked. 

"Urn." I gulped. "Yes?" 

He smiled, and inclined his head slowly until his cold lips brushed against the skin just under the comer of 
my jaw. 

"Right now?" he whispered, his breath blowing cool on my neck. I shivered involuntarily. 

"Yes," I whispered, so my voice wouldn't have a chance to break. If he thought I was bluffing, he was 
going to be disappointed. I'd already made this decision, and I was sure. It didn't matter that my body 
was rigid as a plank, my hands balled into fists, my breathing erratic. . . 

He chuckled darkly, and leaned away. His face did look disappointed. 

"You can't really believe that I would give in so easily," he said with a sour edge to his mocking tone. 
"A girl can dream." 

His eyebrows rose. "Is that what you dream about? Being a monster?" 

"Not exactiy," I said, frowning at his word choice. Monster, indeed. "Mostiy I dream about being with 
you forever." 

His expression changed, softened and saddened by the subtie ache in my voice. 

"Bella." His fingers lightly traced the shape of my hps. "I will stay with you — isn't that enough?" 

I smiled under his fingertips. "Enough for now." 

He frowned at my tenacity. No one was going to surrender tonight. He exhaled, and the sound was 
practically a growl. 

I touched his face. "Look," I said. "I love you more than everything else in the world combined. Isn't that 
enough?" 

"Yes, it is enough," he answered, smiling. "Enough for forever." 



And he leaned down to press his cold lips once more to my throat.

I FELT LIKE I WAS TRAPPED IN ONE OF THOSE TERRIFYING nightmares, the one 
where you have to run, run till your lungs burst, but you can't make your body move fast 
enough. My legs seemed to move slower and slower as I fought my way through the callous 
crowd, but the hands on the huge clock tower didn't slow. With relentless, uncaring force, 
they turned inexorably toward the end-the end of everything. 

But this was no dream, and, unlike the nightmare, I wasn't running for my life; I was racing 
to save something infinitely more precious. My own life meant little to me today. 

Alice had said there was a good chance we would both die here. Perhaps the outcome would 
be different if she weren't trapped by the brilliant sunlight; only I was free to run across this 
bright, crowded square. 

And I couldn't run fast enough. 

So it didn't matter to me that we were surrounded by our extraordinarily dangerous enemies. 
As the clock began to toll out the hour, vibrating under the soles of my sluggish feet, I knew 
I was too late-and I was glad something bloodthirsty waited in the wings. For in failing at 
this, I forfeited any desire to live. 

The clock tolled again, and the sun beat down from the exact center point of the sky. 




1. PARTY 



I WAS NINETY-NINE POINT NINE PERCENT SURE I WAS dreaming. 

The reasons I was so certain were that, first, I was standing in a bright shaft of sunlight-the 
kind of blinding clear sun that never shone on my drizzly new hometown in Forks, 
Washington-and second, I was looking at my Grandma Marie. Gran had been dead for six 
years now, so that was solid evidence toward the dream theory. 

Gran hadn't changed much; her face looked just the same as I remembered it. The skin was 
soft and withered, bent into a thousand tiny creases that clung gently to the bone underneath. 
Like a dried apricot, but with a puff of thick white hair standing out in a cloud around it. 

Our mouths-hers a wizened picker-spread into the same surprised half-smile at just the same 
time. Apparently, she hadn't been expecting to see me, either. 

I was about to ask her a question; I had so many-What was she doing here in my cream? 
What had she been up to in the past six years? Was Pop okay, and had they found each other, 
wherever they were?-but she opened her mouth when I did, so I stopped to let her go first. 
She paused, too, and then we Goth smiled at the little awkwardness. 

"Bella!" 

It wasn't Gran who called my name, and we both turned to see the addition to our small 
reunion. I didn't have to look to know who it was; this was a voice I would know 
anywhere-know, and respond to, whether I was awake or asleep. . . or even dead, I'd bet. The 
voice I'd walk through fire for-or, less dramatically, slosh every day through the cold and 
endless rain for. 

Edward. 

Even though I was always thrilled to see him-conscious or otherwise-and even though I was 
almost positive that I was dreaming, I panicked as Edward walked toward us through the 
glaring sunlight. 

I panicked because Gran didn't know that I was in love with a vampire-nobody knew 
that-so how was I supposed to explain the fact that the brilliant sunbeams were shattering 
off his skin into a thousand rainbow shards like he was made of crystal or diamond? 

Well, Gran, yon might have noticed that my boyfriend glitters. It's just something he does in 
the sun. Don 7 worry about it. . . 

What was he doing ? The whole reason he lived in Forks, the rainiest place in the world, was 
so that he could be outside in the daytime without exposing his family's secret. Yet here he 
was, strolling gracefully toward me-with the most beautiful smile on his angel's face-as if I 




were the only one here. 



In that second, I wished that I was not the one exception to his mysterious talent; I usually 
felt grateful that I was the only person whose thoughts he couldn't hear just as clearly as if 
they were spoken aloud. But now I wished he could hear me, too, so that he could hear the 
warning I was screaming in my head. 

I shot a panicked glance back at Gran, and saw that it was too late. She was just turning to 
stare back at me, her eyes as alarmed as mine. 

Edward-still smiling so beautifully that my heart felt l ik e it was going to swell up and burst 
through my chest-put his arm around my shoulder and turned to face my grandmother. 

Gran's expression surprised me. Instead of looking horrified, she was staring at me 
sheepishly, as if waiting for a scolding. And she was standing in such a strange position-one 
arm held awkwardly away from her body, stretched out and then curled around the air. Like 
she had her arm around someone I couldn't see, someone invisible. . . 

Only then, as I looked at the bigger picture, did I notice the huge gilt frame that enclosed my 
grandmother's form. Uncomprehending, I raised the hand that wasn't wrapped around 
Edward's waist and reached out to touch her. She mimicked the movement exactly, mirrored 
it. But where our fingers should have met, there was nothing but cold glass. . . 

With a dizzying jolt, my dream abruptly became a nightmare. 

There was no Gran. 

That was me. Me in a mirror. Me-ancient, creased, and withered. 

Edward stood beside me, casting no reflection, excruciatingly lovely and forever seventeen. 
He pressed his icy, perfect lips against my wasted cheek. 

"Happy birthday," he whispered. 



I woke with a start-my eyelids popping open wide-and gasped. Dull gray light, the familiar 
light of an overcast morning, took the place of the blinding sun in my dream. 

Just a dream, I told myself. It was only a dream. I took a deep breath, and then jumped again 
when my alarm went off. The little calendar in the comer of the clock's display informed me 
that today was September thirteenth. 

Only a dream, but prophetic enough in one way, at least. Today was my birthday. I was 
officially eighteen years old. 



I'd been dreading this day for months. 




All through the perfect summer-the happiest summer I had ever had, the happiest summer 
anyone anywhere had ever had, and the rainiest summer in the history of the Olympic 
Peninsula-this bleak date had lurked in ambush, waiting to spring. 

And now that it had hit, it was even worse than I'd feared it would be. I could feel it-I was 
older. Every day I got older, but this was different, worse, quantifiable. I was eighteen. 

And Edward never would be. 

When I went to brush my teeth, I was almost surprised that the face in the mirror hadn't 
changed. I stared at myself, looking for some sign of impending wrin kl es in my ivory s ki n. 
The only creases were the ones on my forehead, though, and I knew that if I could manage to 
relax, they would disappear. I couldn't. My eyebrows stayed lodged in a worried line over my 
anxious brown eyes. 

It was just a dream, I reminded myself again. Just a dream. . . but also my worst nightmare. 

I skipped breakfast, in a hurry to get out of the house as quickly as possible. I wasn't entirely 
able to avoid my dad, and so I had to spend a few minutes acting cheerful. I honestly tried to 
be excited about the gifts I'd asked him not to get me, but every time I had to smile, it felt 
l ik e I might start crying. 

I struggled to get a grip on myself as I drove to school. The vision of Gran-I would not think 
of it as me-was hard to get out of my head. I couldn't feel anything but despair until I pulled 
into the fa mili ar parking lot behind Forks High School and spotted Edward leaning 
motionlessly against his polished silver Volvo, like a marble tribute to some forgotten pagan 
god of beauty. The dream had not done him justice. And he was waiting there for me, just 
the same as every other day. 

Despair momentarily vanished; wonder took its place. Even after half a year with him, I still 
couldn't believe that I deserved this degree of good fortune. 

His sister Alice was standing by his side, waiting for me, too. 

Of course Edward and Alice weren't really related (in Forks the story was that all the Cullen 
siblings were adopted by Dr. Carlisle Culler and his wife, Esme, both plainly too young to 
have teenage children), but their skin was precisely the same pale shade, their eyes had the 
same strange golden tint, with the same deep, bruise-l ik e shadows beneath them. Her face, 
like his, was also startlingly beautiful. To someone in the know-someone like me-these 
similarities marked them for what they were. 

The sight of Alice waiting there-her tawny eyes brilliant with excitement, and a small 
silver-wrapped square in her hands-made me frown. I'd told Alice I didn't want anything, 
anything, not gifts or even attention, for my birthday. Obviously, my wishes were being 
ignored. 




I slammed the door of my '53 Chevy truck-a shower of rust specks fluttered down to the wet 
blacktop-and walked slowly toward where they waited. Alice skipped forward to meet me, 
her pixie face glowing under her spiky black hair. 

"Happy birthday, Bella!" 

"Shh!" I hissed, glancing around the lot to make sure no one had heard her. The last thing I 
wanted was some kind of celebration of the black event. 

She ignored me. "Do you want to open your present now or later?" she asked eagerly as we 
made our way to where Edward still waited. 

"No presents," I protested in a mumble. 

She finally seemed to process my mood. "Okay . . . later, then. Did you l ik e the scrapbook your 
mom sent you? And the camera from Charlie?" 

I sighed. Of course she would know what my birthday presents were. Edward wasn't the 
only member of his family with unusual skills. Alice would have "seen" what my parents 
were planning as soon as they'd decided that themselves. 

"Yeah. They're great." 

"/think it's a nice idea. You're only a senior once. Might as well document the experience." 
"How many times have you been a senior?" 

"That's different." 

We reached Edward then, and he held out his hand for mine. I took it eagerly, forgetting, for 
a moment, my glum mood. His skin was, as always, smooth, hard, and very cold. He gave my 
fingers a gentle squeeze. I looked into his liquid topa2 eyes, and my heart gave a 
not-quite-so-gentle squeeze of its own. Hearing the stutter in my heartbeats, he smiled again. 

He lifted his free hand and traced one cool fingertip around the outside of my lips as he 
spoke. "So, as discussed, I am not allowed to wish you a happy birthday, is that correct?" 

"Yes. That is correct." I could never quite mim ic the flow of his perfect, formal articulation. 
It was something that could only be picked up in an earlier century. 

"Just checking." He ran his hand through his tousled bronze hair. "You might have changed 
your mind. Most people seem to enjoy things l ik e birthdays and gifts." 

Alice laughed, and the sound was all silver, a wind chime. "Of course you'll enjoy it. 
Everyone is supposed to be nice to you today and give you your way, Bella. What's the worst 
that could happen?" She meant it as a rhetorical question. 




"Getting older," I answered anyway, and my voice was not as steady as I wanted it to be. 
Beside me, Edward's smile tightened into a hard line. 

"Eighteen isn't very old," Alice said. "Don't women usually wait till they're twenty-nine to 
get upset over birthdays?" 

"It's older than Edward," I mumbled. 

He sighed. 

"Technically," she said, keeping her tone light. "Just by one little year, though." 

And I supposed. . . if I could be sure of the future I wanted, sure that I would get to spend 
forever with Edward, and Alice and the rest of the Cullens (preferably not as a wrinkled little 
old lady). . . then a year or two one direction or the other wouldn't matter to me so much. But 
Edward was dead set against any future that changed me. Any future that made me l ik e 
him-that made me immortal, too. 

An impasse, he called it. 

I couldn't really see Edward's point, to be honest. What was so great about mortality? Being 
a vampire didn't look l ik e such a terrible thing-not the way the Cullens did it, anyway. 

"What time will you be at the house?" Alice continued, changing the subject. From her 
expression, she was up to exactly the kind of thing I'd been hoping to avoid. 

"I didn't know I had plans to be there." 

"Oh, be fair, Bella!" she complained. "You aren't going to ruin all our fun like that, are you?" 
"I thought my birthday was about what I want." 

"I'll get her from Charlie's right after school," Edward told her, ignoring me altogether. 

"I have to work," I protested. 

"You don't, actually," Alice told me smugly. "I already spoke to Mrs. Newton about it. She's 
trading your shifts. She said to tell you 'Happy Birthday.'" 

"I-I still can't come over," I stammered, scrambling for an excuse. "I, well, I haven't watched 
Romeo and Juliet yet for English." 

Alice snorted. "You have Romeo and Juliet memorized." 

"But Mr. Berty said we needed to see it performed to fully appreciate it-that's how 
Shakespeare intended it to be presented." 




Edward rolled his eyes. 

"You've already seen the movie," Alice accused. 

"But not the nineteen-sixties version. Mr. Berty said it was the best." 

Finally, Alice lost the smug smile and glared at me. "This can be easy, or this can be hard, 
Bella, but one way or the other-" 

Edward interrupted her threat. "Relax, Alice. If Bella wants to watch a movie, then she can. 
It's her birthday." 

"So there," I added. 

"I'll bring her over around seven," he continued. "That will give you more time to set up." 

Alice's laughter chimed again. "Sounds good. See you tonight, Bella! It'll be fun, you'll see." 
She grinned-the wide smile exposed all her perfect, glistening teeth-then pecked me on the 
cheek and danced off toward her first class before I could respond. 

"Edward, please-" I started to beg, but he pressed one cool finger to my lips. 

"Let's discuss it later. We're going to be late for class." 

No one bothered to stare at us as we took our usual seats in the back of the classroom (we 
had almost every class together now-it was amazing the favors Edward could get the female 
administrators to do for him). Edward and I had been together too long now to be an object 
of gossip anymore. Even Mike Newton didn't bother to give me the glum stare that used to 
make me feel a little guilty. He smiled now instead, and I was glad he seemed to have 
accepted that we could only be friends. Mike had changed over the summer-his face had lost 
some of the roundness, making his cheekbones more prominent, and he was wearing his pale 
blond hair a new way; instead of bristly, it was longer and gelled into a carefully casual 
disarray. It was easy to see where his inspiration came from-but Edward's look wasn't 
something that could be achieved through imitation. 

As the day progressed, I considered ways to get out of whatever was going down at the 
Cullen house tonight. It would be bad enough to have to celebrate when I was in the mood 
to mourn. But, worse than that, this was sure to involve attention and gifts. 

Attention is never a good thing, as any other accident-prone klutz would agree. No one 
wants a spotlight when they're likely to fall on their face. 

And I'd very pointedly asked-well, ordered really-that no one give me any presents this year. 
It looked l ik e Charlie and Renee weren't the only ones who had decided to overlook that. 



I'd never had much money, and that had never bothered me. Renee had raised me on a 
kindergarten teacher's salary. Charlie wasn't getting rich at his job, either-he was the police 




chief here in the tiny town of Forks. My only personal income came from the three days a 
week I worked at the local sporting goods store. In a town this small, I was lucky to have a 
job. Every penny I made went into my microscopic college fund. (College was Plan B. I was 
still hoping for Plan A, but Edward was just so stubborn about leaving me human. . .) 

Edward had a lot of money-I didn't even want to think about how much. Money meant next 
to nothing to Edward or the rest of the Cullens. It was just something that accumulated 
when you had unlimited time on your hands and a sister who had an uncanny ability to 
predict trends in the stock market. Edward didn't seem to understand why I objected to h im 
spending money on me-why it made me uncomfortable if he took me to an expensive 
restaurant in Seattle, why he wasn't allowed to buy me a car that could reach speeds over 
fifty-five miles an hour, or why I wouldn't let him pay my college tuition (he was ridiculously 
enthusiastic about Plan B). Edward thought I was being unnecessarily difficult. 

But how could I let him give me things when I had nothing to reciprocate with? He, for 
some unfathomable reason, wanted to be with me. Anything he gave me on top of that just 
threw us more out of balance. 

As the day went on, neither Edward nor Alice brought my birthday up again, and I began to 
relax a little. 

We sat at our usual table for lunch. 

A strange kind of truce existed at that table. The three of us-Edward, Alice, and I-sat on the 
extreme southern end of the table. Now that the "older" and somewhat scarier (in Emmett's 
case, certainly) Cullen siblings had graduated, Alice and Edward did not seem quite so 
intimidating, and we did not sit here alone. My other friends, Mike and Jessica (who were in 
the awkward post-breakup friendship phase), Angela and Ben (whose relationship had 
survived the summer), Eric, Conner, Tyler, and Lauren (though that last one didn't really 
count in the friend category) all sat at the same table, on the other side of an invisible line. 
That line dissolved on sunny days when Edward and Alice always skipped school, and then 
the conversation would swell out effortlessly to include me. 

Edward and Alice didn't find this minor ostracism odd or hurtful the way I would have. They 
barely noticed it. People always felt strangely ill at ease with the Cullens, almost afraid for 
some reason they couldn't explain to themselves. I was a rare exception to that rule. 
Sometimes it bothered Edward how very comfortable I was with being close to him. He 
thought he was hazardous to my health-an opinion I rejected vehemently whenever he 
voiced it. 

The afternoon passed quickly. School ended, and Edward walked me to my truck as he 
usually did. But this time, he held the passenger door open for me. Alice must have been 
taking his car home so that he could keep me from making a run for it. 



I folded my arms and made no move to get out of the rain. "It's my birthday, don't I get to 
drive?" 




"I'm pretending it's not your birthday, just as you wished." 

"If it's not my birthday, then I don't have to go to your house tonight. . . " 

"All right." He shut the passenger door and walked past me to open the driver's side. "Happy 
birthday." 

"Shh," I shushed him halfheartedly. I climbed in the opened door, wishing he'd taken the 
other offer. 

Edward played with the radio while I drove, shaking his head in disapproval. 

"Your radio has horrible reception." 

I frowned. I didn't l ik e it when he picked on my truck. The truck was great-it had 
personality. 

"You want a nice stereo? Drive your own car." I was so nervous about Alice's plans, on top 
of my already gloomy mood, that the words came out sharper than I'd meant them. I was 
hardly ever bad-tempered with Edward, and my tone made him press his lips together to keep 
from smiling. 

When I parked in front of Charlie's house, he reached over to take my face in his hands. He 
handled me very carefully, pressing just the tips of his fingers softly against my temples, my 
cheekbones, my jawline. Like I was especially breakable. Which was exactly the 
case-compared with him, at least. 

"You should be in a good mood, today of all days," he whispered. His sweet breath fanned 
across my face. 

"And if I don't want to be in a good mood?" I asked, my breathing uneven. 

His golden eyes smoldered. "Too bad." 

My head was already spinning by the time he leaned closer and pressed his icy lips against 
mine. As he intended, no doubt, I forgot all about my worries, and concentrated on 
remembering how to inhale and exhale. 

His mouth lingered on mine, cold and smooth and gentle, until I wrapped my arms around his 
neck and threw myself into the kiss with a little too much enthusiasm. I could feel his lips 
curve upward as he let go of my face and reached back to unlock my grip on him. 

Edward had drawn many careful lines for our physical relationship, with the intent being to 
keep me alive. Though I respected the need for maintaining a safe distance between my s ki n 
and his razor-sharp, venom-coated teeth, I tended to forget about trivial things l ik e that when 
he was kissing me. 




"Be good, please," he breathed against my cheek. He pressed his lips gently to mine one more 
time and then pulled away, folding my arms across my stomach. 



My pulse was thudding in my ears. I put one hand over my heart. It drummed hyperactively 
under my palm. 

"Do you think I'll ever get better at this?" I wondered, mostly to myself. "That my heart 
might someday stop trying to jump out of my chest whenever you touch me?" 

"I really hope not," he said, a bit smug. 

I rolled my eyes. "Let's go watch the Capulets and Montagues hack each other up, all right?" 
"Your wish, my command." 

Edward sprawled across the couch while I started the movie, fast-forwarding through the 
opening credits. 

When I perched on the edge of the sofa in front of him, he wrapped his arms around my 
waist and pulled me against his chest. It wasn't exactly as comfortable as a sofa cushion 
would be, what with his chest being hard and cold-and perfect-as an ice sculpture, but it 
was definitely preferable. He pulled the old afghan off the back of the couch and draped it 
over me so I wouldn't freeze beside his body. 

"You know, I've never had much patience with Romeo," he commented as the movie started. 

"What's wrong with Romeo?" I asked, a little offended. Romeo was one of my favorite 
fictional characters. Until I'd met Edward, I'd sort of had a thing for h im . 

"Well, first of all, he's in love with this Rosaline-don't you think it makes him seem a little 
fickle? And then, a few minutes after their wedding, he kills Juliet's cousin. That's not very 
brilliant. Mistake after mistake. Could he have destroyed his own happiness any more 
thoroughly?" 

I sighed. "Do you want me to watch this alone?" 

"No, I'll mostly be watching you, anyway." His fingers traced patterns across the skin of my 
arm, raising goose bumps. "Will you cry?" 

"Probably," I admitted, "if I'm paying attention." 

"I won't distract you then." But I felt his lips on my hair, and it was very distracting. 

The movie eventually captured my interest, thanks in large part to Edward whispering 
Romeo's lines in my ear-his irresistible, velvet voice made the actor's voice sound weak and 
coarse by comparison. And I did cry, to his amusement, when Juliet woke and found her new 
husband dead. 




"I'll admit, I do sort of envy him here," Edward said, drying the tears with a lock of my hair. 
"She's very pretty." 

He made a disgusted sound. "I don't envy him the girl - just the ease of the suicide," he 
clarified in a teasing tone. "You humans have it so easy! All you have to do is throw down 
one tiny vial of plant extracts ..." 

"What?" I gasped. 

"It's something I had to think about once, and I knew from Carlisle's experience that it 
wouldn't be simple. I'm not even sure how many ways Carlisle tried to kill himself in the 
beginning... after he realized what he'd become..." His voice, which had grown serious, 
turned light again. "And he's clearly still in excellent health." 

I twisted around so that I could read his face. "What are you talking about?" I demanded. 
"What do you mean, this something you had to think about once?" 

"Last spring, when you were... nearly killed..." He paused to take a deep breath, snuggling 
to return to his teasing tone. "Of course I was trying to focus on finding you alive, but part of 
my mind was making contingency plans. Like I said, it's not as easy for me as it is for a 
human." 

Lor one second, the memory of my last trip to Phoenix washed through my head and made 
me feel dizzy. I could see it all so clearly-the blinding sun, the heat waves coming off the 
concrete as I ran with desperate haste to find the sadistic vampire who wanted to torture me 
to death. James, waiting in the mirrored room with my mother as his hostage-or so I'd 
thought. I hadn't known it was all a ruse. Just as James hadn't known that Edward was 
racing to save me; Edward made it in time, but it had been a close one. Unthinkingly, my 
fingers traced the crescent- shaped scar on my hand that was always just a few degrees cooler 
than the rest of my s ki n. 

I shook my head-as if I could shake away the bad memories-and tried to grasp what Edward 
meant. My stomach plunged uncomfortably. "Contingency plans?" I repeated. 

"Well, I wasn't going to live without you." He rolled his eyes as if that fact were childishly 
obvious. "But I wasn't sure how to do it-I knew Emmett and Jasper would never help. . . so I 
was thinking maybe I would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi." 

I didn't want to believe he was serious, but his golden eyes were brooding, focused on 
something far away in the distance as he contemplated ways to end his own life. Abruptly, I 
was furious. 

"What is a Volturi ?" I demanded. 



The Volturi are a family," he explained, his eyes still remote. "A very old, very powerful 




family of our kind. They are the closest thing our world has to a royal family, I suppose. 
Carlisle lived with them briefly in his early years, in Italy, before he settled in America-do 
you remember the story?" 

"Of course I remember." 

I would never forget the first time I'd gone to his home, the huge white mansion buried deep 
in the forest beside the river, or the room where Carlisle-Edward's father in so many real 
ways-kept a wall of paintings that illustrated his personal history. The most vivid, most 
wildly colorful canvas there, the largest, was from Carlisle's time in Italy. Of course I 
remembered the calm quartet of men, each with the exquisite face of a seraph, painted into 
the highest balcony overlooking the swirling mayhem of color. Though the painting was 
centuries old, Carlisle-the blond angel-remained unchanged. And I remembered the three 
others, Carlisle's early acquaintances. Edward had never used the name Volturi for the 
beautiful trio, two black-haired, one snow white. He'd called them Aro, Caius, and Marcus, 
nighttime patrons of the arts. . . 

"Anyway, you don't irritate the Volturi," Edward went on, interrupting ray reverie. "Not 
unless you want to die-or whatever it is we do." His voice was so calm, it made him sound 
almost bored by the prospect. 

My anger turned to horror. I took his marble face between my hands and held it very tightly. 

"You must never, never, never think of anything like that again!" I said. "No matter what 
might ever happen to me, you are not allowed to hurt yourself!" 

"I'll never put you in danger again, so it's a moot point." 

"Put me in danger! I thought we'd established that all the bad luck is my fault?" I was getting 
angrier. "How dare you even think l ik e that?" The idea of Edward ceasing to exist, even if I 
were dead, was impossibly painful. 

"What would you do, if the situation were reversed?" he asked. 

"That's not the same thing." 

He didn't seem to understand the difference. He chuckled. 

"What if something did happen to you?" I blanched at the thought. "Would you want me to 
go off myself?" 

A trace of pain touched his perfect features. 

"I guess I see your point. . . a little," he admitted. "But what would I do without you?" 
"Whatever you were doing before I came along and complicated your existence." 




He sighed. "You make that sound so easy." 

"It should be. I'm not really that interesting." 

He was about to argue, but then he let it go. "Moot point," he reminded me. Abruptly, he 
pulled himself up into a more formal posture, shifting me to the side so that we were no 
longer touching. 

"Charlie?" I guessed. 

Edward smiled. After a moment, I heard the sound of the police cruiser pulling into the 
driveway. I reached out and took his hand firmly. My dad could deal with that much. 

Charlie came in with a pizza box in his hands. 

"Hey, kids." He grinned at me. "I thought you'd l ik e a break from cooking and washing 
dishes for your birthday. Hungry?" 

"Sure. Thanks, Dad." 

Charlie didn't comment on Edward's apparent lack of appetite. He was used to Edward 
passing on dinner. 

"Do you mind if I borrow Bella for the evening?" Edward asked when Charlie and I were 
done. 

I looked at Charlie hopefully. Maybe he had some concept of birthdays as stay-at-home, 
family affairs-this was my first birthday with him, the first birthday since my mom, Renee, 
had remarried and gone to live in Florida, so I didn't know what he would expect. 

"That's fine-the Mariners are playing the Sox tonight," Charlie explained, and my hope 
disappeared. "So I won't be any kind of company... Here." He scooped up the camera he'd 
gotten me on Renee's suggestion (because I would need pictures to fill up my scrap-book), 
and threw it to me. 

He ought to know better than that-I'd always been coordinationally challenged. The camera 
glanced off the tip of my finger, and tumbled toward the floor. Edward snagged it before it 
could crash onto the linoleum. 

"Nice save," Charlie noted. "If they're doing something fun at the Cullens' tonight, Bella, you 
should take some pictures. You know how your mother gets-she'll be wanting to see the 
pictures faster than you can take them." 

"Good idea, Charlie," Edward said, handing me the camera. 

I turned the camera on Edward, and snapped the first picture. "It works." 




"That's good. Hey, say hi to Alice for me. She hasn't been over in a while." Charlie's mouth 
pulled down at one corner. 



"It's been three days, Dad," I reminded him. Charlie was crazy about Alice. He'd become 
attached last spring when she'd helped me through my awkward convalescence; Charlie 
would be fore'ter grateful to her for saving him from the horror of an almost-adult daughter 
who needed help showering. "I'll tell her." 

"Okay. You kids have fun tonight." It was clearly a dismissal. Charlie was already edging 
toward the living room and the TV. 

Edward smiled, triumphant, and took my hand to pull me from the kitchen. 

When we got to the truck, he opened the passenger door for me again, and this time I didn't 
argue. I still had a hard time finding the obscure turnoff to his house in the dark. 

Edward drove north through Forks, visibly chafing at the speed limit enforced by my 
prehistoric Chevy. The engine groaned even louder than usual as he pushed it over fifty. 

"Take it easy," I warned him. 

"You know what you would love? A nice little Audi coupe. Very quiet, lots of power. . . " 

"There's nothing wrong with my truck. And speaking of expensive nonessentials, if you 
know what's good for you, you didn't spend any money on birthday presents." 

"Not a dime," he said virtuously. 

"Good." 

"Can you do me a favor?" 

"That depends on what it is." 

He sighed, his lovely face serious. "Bella, the last real birthday any of us had was Emmett in 
1935. Cut us a little slack, and don't be too difficult tonight. They're all very excited." 

It always startled me a little when he brought up things l ik e that. "Fine, I'll behave." 

"I probably should warn you. . . " 

"Please do." 

"When I say they're all excited. . . I do mean all of them." 

"Everyone?" I choked. "I thought Emmett and Rosalie were in Africa." The rest of Forks was 
under the impression that the older Cullens had gone off to college this year, to Dartmouth, 
but I knew better. 




Emmett wanted to be here. 



"But... Rosalie?" 

"I know, Bella. Don't worry, she'll be on her best behavior." 

I didn't answer. Like I could just not worry, that easy. Unlike Alice, Edward's other 
"adopted" sister, the golden blond and exquisite Rosalie, didn't like me much. Actually, the 
feeling was a little bit stronger than just disl ik e. As far as Rosalie was concerned, I was an 
unwelcome intruder into her family's secret life. 

I felt horribly guilty about the present situation, guessing that Rosalie and Emmett's 
prolonged absence was my fault, even as I furtively enjoyed not having to see her Emmett, 
Edward's playful bear of a brother, I did miss. He was in many ways just like the big brother 
I'd always wanted. . . only much, much more terrifying. 

Edward decided to change the subject. "So, if you won't let me get you the Audi, isn't there 
anything that you'd l ik e for your birthday?" 

The words came out in a whisper. "You know what I want." 

A deep frown carved creases into his marble forehead. He obviously wished he'd stuck to the 
subject of Rosalie. 

It felt like we'd had this argument a lot today. 

"Not tonight, Bella. Please." 

"Well, maybe Alice will give me what I want." 

Edward growled-a deep, menacing sound. "This isn't going to be your last birthday, Bella," 
he vowed. 

"That's not fair!" 

I thought I heard his teeth clench together. 

We were pulling up to the house now. Bright light shined from every window on the first 
two floors. A long line of glowing Japanese lanterns hung from the porch eaves, reflecting a 
soft radiance on the huge cedars that surrounded the house. Big bowls of flowers-pink 
roses-lined the wide stairs up to the front doors. 

I moaned. 

Edward took a few deep breaths to calm himself. "This is a party," he reminded me. "Try to 
be a good sport." 



Sure," I muttered. 




He came around to get my door, and offered me his hand. 

"I have a question." 

He waited warily. 

"If I develop this film," I said, toying with the camera in my hands, "will you show up in the 
picture?" 

Edward started laughing. He helped me out of the car, pulled me up the stairs, and was still 
laughing as he opened the door for me. 

They were all waiting in the huge white living room; when I walked through the door, they 
greeted me with a loud chorus of "Happy birthday, Bella!" while I blushed and looked down. 
Alice, I assumed, had covered every flat surface with pink candles and dozens of crystal 
bowls filled with hundreds of roses. There was a table with a white cloth draped over it next 
to Edward's grand piano, holding a pink birthday cake, more roses, a stack of glass plates, 
and a small pile of silver- wrapped presents. 

It was a hundred times worse than I'd imagined. 

Edward, sensing my distress, wrapped an encouraging arm around my waist and kissed the 
top of my head. 

Edward's parents, Carlisle and Esme-impossibly youthful and lovely as ever-were the closest 
to the door. Esme hugged me carefully, her soft, caramel-colored hair brushing against my 
cheek as she kissed my forehead, and then Carlisle put his arm around my shoulders. 

"Sorry about this, Bella," he stage-whispered. "We couldn't rein Alice in." 

Rosalie and Emmett stood behind them. Rosalie didn't smile, but at least she didn't glare. 
Emmett's face was stretched into a huge grin. It had been months since I'd seen them; I'd 
forgotten how gloriously beautiful Rosalie was-it almost hurt to look at her. And had 
Emmett always been so. . . big? 

"You haven't changed at all," Emmett said with mock disappointment. "I expected a 
perceptible difference, but here you are, red-faced just like always." 

"Thanks a lot, Emmett," I said, blushing deeper. 

He laughed, "I have to step out for a second"-he paused to wink conspicuously at 
Alice-"Don't do anything funny while I'm gone." 

"I'll try." 



Alice let go of Jasper's hand and skipped forward, all her teeth sparkling in the bright light. 
Jasper smiled, too, but kept his distance. He leaned, long and blond, against the post at the 




foot of the stairs. During the days we'd had to spend cooped up together in Phoenix, I'd 
thought he'd gotten over his aversion to me. But he'd gone back to exactly how he'd acted 
before-avoiding me as much as possible-the moment he was free from that temporary 
obligation to protect me. I knew it wasn't personal, just a precaution, and I tried not to be 
overly sensitive about it. Jasper had more trouble sticking to the Cullens' diet than the rest of 
them; the scent of human blood was much harder for him to resist than the others-he hadn't 
been trying as long. 

"Time to open presents," Alice declared. She put her cool hand under my elbow and towed 
me to the table with the cake and the shiny packages. 

I put on my best martyr face. "Alice, I know I told you I didn't want anything-" 

"But I didn't listen," she interrupted, smug. "Open it." She took the camera from my hands 
and replaced it with a big, square silver box. 

The box was so light that it felt empty. The tag on top said that it was from Emmett, 
Rosalie, and Jasper. Selfconsciously, I tore the paper off and then stared at the box it 
concealed. 

It was something electrical, with lots of numbers in the name. I opened the box, hoping for 
further illumination. But the box was empty. 

"Urn... thanks." 

Rosalie actually cracked a smile. Jasper laughed. "It's a stereo for your truck," he explained. 
"Emmett's installing it right now so that you can't return it." 

Alice was always one step ahead of me. "Thanks, Jasper, Rosalie," I told them, grinning as I 
remembered Edward's complaints about my radio this aftemoon-all a setup, apparently. 
"Thanks, Emmett!" I called more loudly. 

I heard his booming laugh from my truck, and I couldn't help laughing, too. 

"Open mine and Edward's next," Alice said, so excited her voice was a high-pitched trill. She 
held a small, flat square in her hand. 

I turned to give Edward a basilisk glare. "You promised." 

Before he could answer, Emmett bounded through the door. "Just in time!" he crowed. He 
pushed in behind Jasper, who had also drifted closer than usual to get a good look. 

"I didn't spend a dime," Edward assured me. He brushed a strand of hair from my face, 
leaving my skin tingling from his touch. 



I inhaled deeply and turned to Alice. "Give it to me," I sighed. 




Emmett chuckled with delight. 



I took the little package, rolling my eyes at Edward while I stuck my finger under the edge of 
the paper and jerked it under the tape. 

"Shoot," I muttered when the paper sliced my finger; I pulled it out to examine the damage. 
A single drop of blood oozed from the tiny cut. 

It all happened very quickly then. 

"No!" Edward roared. 

He threw himself at me, flinging me back across the table. It fell, as I did, scattering the cake 
and the presents, the flowers and the plates. I landed in the mess of shattered crystal. 

Jasper slammed into Edward, and the sound was l ik e the crash of boulders in a rock slide. 

There was another noise, a grisly snarling that seemed to be coming from deep in Jasper's 
chest. Jasper tried to shove past Edward, snapping his teeth just inches from Edward's face. 

Emmett grabbed Jasper from behind in the next second, locking him into his massive steel 
grip, but Jasper struggled on, his wild, empty eyes focused only on me. 

Beyond the shock, there was also pain. I'd tumbled down to the floor by the piano, with my 
arms thrown out instinctively to catch my fall, into the jagged shards of glass. Only now did I 
feel the searing, stinging pain that ran from my wrist to the crease inside my elbow. 

Dazed and disoriented, I looked up from the bright red blood pulsing out of my arm-into the 
fevered eyes of the six suddenly ravenous vampires. 




2 STITCHES 



CARLISLE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO STAYED calm. Centuries of experience 
in the emergency room were evident in his quiet, authoritative voice. 

"Emmett, Rose, get Jasper outside." 

Unsmiling for once, Emmett nodded. "Come on, Jasper." 

Jasper struggled against Emmett's unbreakable grasp, twisting around, reaching toward his 
brother with his bared teeth, his eyes still past reason. 

Edward's face was whiter than bone as he wheeled to crouch over me, taking a clearly 
defensive position. A low warning growl slid from between his clenched teeth. I could tell 
that he wasn't breathing. 

Rosalie, her divine face strangely smug, stepped in front of Jasper-keeping a careful distance 
from his teeth-and helped Emmett wrestle him through the glass door that Esme held open, 
one hand pressed over her mouth and nose. 

Esme's heart-shaped face was ashamed. "I'm so sorry, Bella," she cried as she followed the 
others into the yard. 

"Let me by, Edward," Carlisle murmured. 

A second passed, and then Edward nodded slowly and relaxed his stance. 

Carlisle knelt beside me, leaning close to examine my arm. I could feel the shock frozen on 
my face, and I tried to compose it. 

"Here, Carlisle," Alice said, handing him a towel. 

He shook his head. "Too much glass in the wound." He reached over and ripped a long, thin 
scrap from the bottom of the white tablecloth. He twisted it around my arm above the elbow 
to form a tourniquet. The smell of the blood was making me dizzy. My ears rang. 

"Bella," Carlisle said softly. "Do you want me to drive you to the hospital, or would you l ik e 
me to take care of it here?" 

"Here, please," I whispered. If he took me to the hospital, there would be no way to keep this 
from Charlie. 

"I'll get your bag," Alice said. 

"Let's take her to the kitchen table," Carlisle said to Edward. 

Edward lifted me effortlessly, while Carlisle kept the pressure steady on my arm. 




How are you doing, Bella?" Carlisle asked. 



"I'm fine." My voice was reasonably steady, which pleased me. 

Edward's face was l ik e stone. 

Alice was there. Carlisle's black bag was already on the table, a small but brilliant desk light 
plugged into the wall. Edward sat me gently into a chair, and Carlisle pulled up another. He 
went to work at once. 

Edward stood over me, still protective, still not breathing. 

"Just go, Edward," I sighed. 

"I can handle it," he insisted. But his jaw was rigid; his eyes burned with the intensity of the 
thirst he fought, so much worse for him than it was for the others. 

"You don't need to be a hero," I said. "Carlisle can fix me up without your help. Get some 
fresh air." 

I winced as Carlisle did something to my arm that stung. 

"I'll stay," he said. 

"Why are you so masochistic?" I mumbled. 

Carlisle decided to intercede. "Edward, you may as well go find Jasper before he gets too far. 
I'm sure he's upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now." 

"Yes," I eagerly agreed. "Go find Jasper." 

"You might as well do something useful," Alice added. 

Edward's eyes narrowed as we ganged up on him, but, finally, he nodded once and sprinted 
smoothly through the kitchen's back door. I was sure he hadn't taken a breath since I'd sliced 
my finger. 

A numb, dead feeling was spreading through my arm. 

Though it erased the sting, it reminded me of the gash, and I watched Carlisle's face carefully 
to distract me from what his hands were doing. His hair gleamed gold in the bright light as 
he bent over my arm. I could feel the faint stirrings of unease in the pit of my stomach, but I 
was determined not to let my usual squeamishness get the best of me. There was no pain 
now, just a gentle tugging sensation that I tried to ignore. No reason to get sick like a baby. 

If she hadn't been in my line of sight, I wouldn't have noticed Alice give up and steal out of 
the room. With a tiny, apologetic smile on her lips, she disappeared through the kitchen 
doorway. 




"Well, that's everyone," I sighed. "I can clear a room, at least." 

"It's not your fault," Carlisle comforted me with a chuckle. "It could happen to anyone." 
"Could" I repeated. "But it usually just happens to me." 

He laughed again. 

His relaxed calm was only more amazing set in direct contrast with everyone else's reaction. I 
couldn't find any trace of anxiety in his face. He worked with quick, sure movements. The 
only sound besides our quiet breathing was the soft plink, plink as the tiny fragments of glass 
dropped one by one to the table. 

"How can you do this?" I demanded. "Even Alice and Esme. . ." I trailed off, shaking my head 
in wonder. Though the rest of them had given up the traditional diet of vampires just as 
absolutely as Carlisle had, he was the only one who could bear the smell of my blood without 
suffering from the intense temptation. Clearly, this was much more difficult than he made it 
seem. 

"Years and years of practice," he told me. "I barely notice the scent anymore." 

"Do you think it would be harder if you took a vacation from the hospital for a long time. 
And weren't around any blood?" 

"Maybe." He shrugged his shoulders, but his hands remained steady. "I've never felt the need 
for an extended holiday." He flashed a brilliant smile in my direction. "I enjoy my work too 
much." 

Plink, plink, plink. I was surprised at how much glass there seemed to be in my arm. I was 
tempted to glance at the growing pile, just to check the size, but I knew that idea would not 
be helpful to my no- vomiting strategy. 

"What is it that you enjoy?" I wondered. It didn't make sense to me-the years of struggle and 
self-denial he must have spent to get to the point where he could endure this so easily. 
Besides, I wanted to keep him talking; the conversation kept my mind off the queasy feeling 
in my stomach. 

His dark eyes were calm and thoughtful as he answered. "Hmm. What I enjoy the very most 
is when my... enhanced abilities let me save someone who would otherwise have been lost. 
It's pleasant knowing that, thanks to what I can do, some people's lives are better because I 
exist. Even the sense of smell is a useful diagnostic tool at times." One side of his mouth 
pulled up in half a smile. 

I mulled that over while he poked around, making sure all the glass splinters were gone. 
Then he rummaged in his bag for new tools, and I tried not to picture a needle and thread. 



You try very hard to make up for something that was never your fault," I suggested while a 




new kind of tugging started at the edges of my skin. "What I mean is, it's not like you asked 
for this. You didn't choose this kind of life, and yet you have to work so hard to be good." 



"I don't know that I'm making up for anything," he disagreed lightly. "Like everything in life, 
I just had to decide what to do with what I was given." 

"That makes it sound too easy." 

He examined my arm again. "There," he said, snipping a thread. "All done." He wiped an 
oversized Q-tip, dripping with some syrup-colored liquid, thoroughly across the operation 
site. The smell was strange; it made my head spin. The syrup stained my s ki n. 

"In the beginning, though," I pressed while he taped another long piece of gauze securely in 
place, sealing it to my skin. "Why did you even think to try a different way than the obvious 
one?" 

His lips turned up in a private smile. "Hasn't Edward told you this story?" 

"Yes. But I'm trying to understand what you were thinking. . ." 

His face was suddenly serious again, and I wondered if his thoughts had gone to the same 
place that mine had. Wondering what I would be thinking when-I refused to think if - it was 
me. 



"You know my father was a clergyman," he mused as he cleaned the table carefully, rubbing 
everything down with wet gauze, and then doing it again. The smell of alcohol burned in my 
nose. "He had a rather harsh view of the world, which I was already beginning to question 
before the time that I changed." Carlisle put all the dirty gauze and the glass slivers into an 
empty crystal bowl. I didn't understand what he was doing, even when he lit the match. Then 
he threw it onto the alcohol-soaked fibers, and the sudden blaze made me jump. 

"Sorry," he apologized. "That ought to do it... So I didn't agree with my father's particular 
brand of faith. But never, in the nearly four hundred years now since I was born, have I ever 
seen anything to make me doubt whether God exists in some form or the other. Not even the 
reflection in the mirror." 

I pretended to examine the dressing on my arm to hide my surprise at the direction our 
conversation had taken. Religion was the last thing I expected, all things considered. My 
own life was fairly devoid of belief. Charlie considered himself a Lutheran, because that's 
what his parents had been, but Sundays he worshipped by the river with a fishing pole in his 
hand. Renee tried out a church now and then, but, much l ik e her brief affairs with tennis, 
pottery, yoga, and French classes, she moved on by the time I was aware of her newest fad. 

"I'm sure all this sounds a little bizarre, coming from a vampire." He grinned, knowing how 
their casual use of that word never failed to shock me. "But I'm hoping that there is still a 
point to this life, even for us. It's a long shot, I'll admit," he continued in an offhand voice. 




"By all accounts, we're damned regardless. But I hope, maybe foolishly, that we'll get some 
measure of credit for trying." 

"I don't think that's foolish," I mumbled. I couldn't imagine anyone, deity included, who 
wouldn't be impressed by Carlisle. Besides, the only kind of heaven I could appreciate would 
have to include Edward. "And I don't think anyone else would, either." 

"Actually, you're the very first one to agree with me." 

"The rest of them don't feel the same?" I asked, surprised, thinking of only one person in 
particular. 

Carlisle guessed the direction of my thoughts again. "Edward's with me up to a point. God 
and heaven exist. . . and so does hell. But he doesn't believe there is an afterlife for our ki nd." 
Carlisle's voice was very soft; he stared out the big window over the sink, into the darkness. 
"You see, he thinks we've lost our souls." 

I immediately thought of Edward's words this afternoon: unless you want to die-or whatever 
it is that we do. The lightbulb flicked on over my head. 

"That's the real problem, isn't it?" I guessed. "That's why he's being so difficult about me." 

Carlisle spoke slowly. "I look at my... son. His strength, his goodness, the brightness that 
shines out of him-and it only fuels that hope, that faith, more than ever. How could there not 
be more for one such as Edward?" 

I nodded in fervent agreement. 

"But if I believed as he does..." He looked down at me with unfathomable eyes. "If you 
believed as he did. Could you take away his soul?" 

The way he phrased the question thwarted my answer. 

If he'd asked me whether I would risk my soul for Edward, the reply would be obvious. But 
would I risk Edward's soul? I pursed my lips unhappily. That wasn't a fair exchange. 

"You see the problem." 

I shook my head, aware of the stubborn set of my chin. 

Carlisle sighed. 

"It's my choice," I insisted. 

"It's his, too." He held up his hand when he could see that I was about to argue. "Whether he 
is responsible for doing that to you." 



He's not the only one able to do it." I eyed Carlisle speculatively. 




He laughed, abruptly lightening the mood. "Oh, no! You're going to have to work this out 
with him." But then he sighed. "That's the one part I can never be sure of. I think , in most 
other ways, that I've done the best I could with what I had to work with. But was it right to 
doom the others to this life? I can't decide." 

I didn't answer. I imagined what my life would be l ik e if Carlisle had resisted the temptation 
to change his lonely existence. . . and shuddered. 

"It was Edward's mother who made up my mind." Carlisle's voice was almost a whisper. He 
stared unseeingly out the black windows. 

"His mother?" Whenever I'd asked Edward about his parents, he would merely say that they 
had died long ago, and his memories were vague. I realized Carlisle's memory of them, 
despite the brevity of their contact, would be perfectly clear. 

"Yes. Her name was Elizabeth. Elizabeth Masen. His father, Edward Senior, never regained 
consciousness in the hospital. He died in the first wave of the influenza. But Elizabeth was 
alert until almost the very end. Edward looks a great deal like her-she had that same strange 
bronze shade to her hair, and her eyes were exactly the same color green." 

"His eyes were green?" I murmured, trying to picture it. 

"Yes..." Carlisle's ocher eyes were a hundred years away now. "Elizabeth worried 
obsessively over her son. She hurt her own chances of survival trying to nurse him from her 
sickbed. I expected that he would go first, he was so much worse off than she was. When the 
end came for her, it was very quick. It was just after sunset, and I'd arrived to relieve the 
doctors who'd been working all day. That was a hard time to pretend-there was so much 
work to be done, and I had no need of rest. How I hated to go back to my house, to hide in 
the dark and pretend to sleep while so many were dying. 

"I went to check Elizabeth and her son first. I'd grown attached-always a dangerous thing to 
do considering the fragile nature of humans. I could see at once that she'd taken a bad turn. 
The fever was raging out of control, and her body was too weak to fight anymore. 

"She didn't look weak, though, when she glared up at me from her cot. 

"Save him!' she commanded me in the hoarse voice that was all her throat could manage. 

"I'll do everything in my power,' I promised her, taking her hand. The fever was so high, she 
probably couldn't even tell how unnaturally cold mine felt. Everything felt cold to her skin. 

"You must," she insisted, clutching at my hand with enough strength that I wondered if she 
wouldn't pull through the crisis after all. Her eyes were hard, l ik e stones, like emeralds. 'You 
must do everything in your power. What others cannot do, that is what you must do for my 
Edward." 




"It frightened me. She looked it me with those piercing eyes, and, for one instant, I felt 
certain that she knew my secret. Then the fever overwhelmed her, and she never regained 
consciousness. She died within an hour of making her demand. 

"I'd spent decades considering the idea of creating a companion for myself. Just one other 
creature who could really know me, rather than what I pretended to be. But I could never 
justify it to myself-doing what had been done to me. 

"There Edward lay, dying. It was clear that he had only hours left. Beside him, his mother, 
her face somehow not yet peaceful, not even in death." 

Carlisle saw it all again, his memory unblurred by the intervening century. I could see it 
clearly, too, as he spoke-the despair of the hospital, the overwhelming atmosphere of death. 
Edward burning with fever, his life slipping away with each tick of the clock. . . I shuddered 
again, and forced the picture from my mind. 

"Elizabeth's words echoed in my head. How could she guess what I could do? Could anyone 
really want that for her son? 

"I looked at Edward. Sick as he was, he was still beautiful. There was something pure and 
good about his face. The kind of face I would have wanted my son to have. 

"After all those years of indecision, I simply acted on a whim. I wheeled his mother to the 
morgue first, and then I came back for him. No one noticed that he was still breathing. There 
weren't enough hands, enough eyes, to keep track of half of what the patients needed. The 
morgue was empty-of the living, at least. I stole him out the back door, and carried him 
across the rooftops back to my home. 

"I wasn't sure what had to be done. I settled for recreating the wounds I'd received myself, so 
many centuries earlier in London. I felt bad about that later. It was more painful and lingering 
than necessary. 

"I wasn't sorry, though. I've never been sorry that I saved Edward." He shook his head, 
coming back to the present. He smiled at me. "I suppose I should take you home now." 

"I'll do that," Edward said. He came through the shadowy dining room, walking slowly for 
him. His face was smooth, unreadable, but there was something wrong with his 
eyes-something he was trying very hard to hide. I felt a spasm of unease in my stomach. 

"Carlisle can take me," I said. I looked down at my shirt; the light blue cotton was soaked 
and spotted with my blood. My right shoulder was covered in thick pink frosting. 

"I'm fine." Edward's voice was unemotional. "You'll need to change anyway. You'd give 
Charlie a heart attack the way you look. I'll have Alice get you something." He strode out the 
kitchen door again. 




I looked at Carlisle anxiously. "He's very upset." 

"Yes," Carlisle agreed. "Tonight is exactly the kind of thing that he fears the most. You 
being put in danger, because of what we are." 

"It's not his fault." 

"It's not yours, either." 

I looked away from his wise, beautiful eyes. I couldn't agree with that. 

Carlisle offered me his hand and helped me up from the table. I followed him out into the 
main room. Esme had come back; she was mopping the floor where I'd fallen-with straight 
bleach from the smell of it. 

"Esme, let me do that." I could feel that my face was bright red again. 

"I'm already done." She smiled up at me. "How do you feel?" 

"I'm fine," I assured her. "Carlisle sews faster than any other doctor I've had." 

They both chuckled. 

Alice and Edward came in the back doors. Alice hurried to my side, but Edward hung back, 
his face indecipherable. 

"C'mon," Alice said. "I'll get you something less macabre to wear." 

She found me a shirt of Esme's that was close to the same color mine had been. Charlie 
wouldn't notice, I was sure. The long white bandage on my arm didn't look nearly as serious 
when I was no longer spattered in gore. Charlie was never surprised to see me bandaged. 

"Alice," I whispered as she headed back to the door. 

"Yes?" She kept her voice low, too, and looked at me curiously, her head cocked to the side. 

"How bad is it?" I couldn't be sure if my whispering was a wasted effort. Even though we 
were upstairs, with the door closed, perhaps he could hear me. 

Her face tensed. "I'm not sure yet." 

"How's Jasper?" 

She sighed. "He's very unhappy with himself. It's all so much more of challenge for him, and 
he hates feeling weak." 

"It's not his fault. You'll tell him that I'm not mad at him, not at all, won't you?" 




Of course. 



Edward was waiting for me by the front door. As I got to the bottom of the staircase, he held 
it open without a word. 

"Take your things!" Alice cried as I walked warily toward Edward. She scooped up the two 
packages, one half-opened, and my camera from under the piano, and pressed them into my 
good arm. "You can thank me later, when you've opened them." 

Esme and Carlisle both said a quiet goodnight. I could see them stealing quick glances at 
their impassive son, much l ik e I was. 

It was a relief to be outside; I hurried past the lanterns and the roses, now unwelcome 
reminders. Edward kept pace with me silently. He opened the passenget side for me, and I 
climbed in without complaint. 

On the dashboard was a big red ribbon, stuck to the new stereo. I pulled it off, throwing it to 
the floor. As Edward slid into the other side, I kicked the ribbon under my seat. 

He didn't look at me or the stereo. Neither of us switched it on, and the silence was 
somehow intensified by the sudden thunder of the engine. He drove too fast down the dark, 
serpentine lane. 

The silence was making me insane. 

"Say something," I finally begged as he turned onto the freeway. 

"What do you want me to say?" he asked in a detached voice. 

I cringed at his remoteness. 'Tell me you forgive me." 

That brought a flicker of life to his face-a flicker of anger. "Forgive youl For what?" 

"If I'd been more careful, nothing would have happened." 

"Bella, you gave yourself a paper cut-that hardly deserves the death penalty." 

"It's still my fault." 

My words opened up the floodgate. 

"Your fault? If you'd cut yourself at Mike Newton's house, with Jessica there and Angela and 
your other normal friends, the worst that could possibly have happened would be what? 
Maybe they couldn't find you a bandage? If you'd tripped and knocked over a pile of glass 
plates on your own-without someone throwing you into them-even then, what's the worst? 
You'd get blood on the seats when they drove you to the emergency room? Mike Newton 
could have held your hand while they stitched you up-and he wouldn't be righting the urge 




to kill you the whole time he was there. Don't try to take any of this on yourself, Bella. It will 
only make me more disgusted with myself." 

"How the hell did Mike Newton end up in this conversation?" I demanded. 

"Mike Newton ended up in this conversation because Mike Newton would be a hell of a lot 
healthier for you to be with," he growled. 

"I'd rather die than be with Mike Newton," I protested. "I'd rather die than be with anyone 
but you." 

"Don't be melodramatic, please." 

"Well then, don't you be ridiculous." 

He didn't answer. He glared through the windshield, his expression black. 

I racked my brain for some way to salvage the evening. When we pulled up in front of my 
house, I still hadn't come up with anything. 

He killed the engine, but his hands stayed clenched around the steering wheel. 

"Will you stay tonight?" I asked. 

"I should go home." 

The last thing I wanted was for him to go wallow in remorse. 

"For my birthday," I pressed. 

"You can't have it both ways-either you want people to ignore your birthday or you don't. 
One or the other." 

His voice was stem, but not .is serious as before. I breathed a silent sigh of relief. 

"Okay. I've decided that I don't want you to ignore my birthday. I'll see you upstairs." 

I hopped out, reaching back in for my packages. He frowned. 

"You don't have to take those." 

"I want them," I responded automatically, and then wondered if he was using reverse 
psychology. 

"No, you don't. Carlisle and Esme spent money on you." 

"I'll live." I tucked the presents awkwardly under my good arm and slammed the door behind 
me. He was out of the truck and by my side in less than a second. 




"Let me carry them, at least." he said as he took them away. "I'll be in your room." 

I smiled. "Thanks." 

"Happy birthday," he sighed, and leaned down to touch his lips to mine. 

I reached up on my toes to make the kiss last longer when he pulled away. He smiled my 
favorite crooked smile, and then he disappeared into the darkness. 

The game was still on; as soon as I walked through the front door I could hear the announcer 
rambling over the babble of the crowd. 

"Bell?" Charlie called. 

"Hey, Dad," I said as I came around the comer. I held my arm close to my side. The slight 
pressure burned, and I wrinkled my nose. The anesthetic was apparently losing its 
effectiveness. 

"How was it?" Charlie lounged across the sofa with his bare feet propped up on the arm. 
What was left of his curly brown hair was crushed flat on one side. 

"Alice went overboard. Flowers, cake, candles, presents-the whole bit." 

"What did they get you?" 

"A stereo for my truck." And various unknowns. 

"Wow." 

"Yeah," I agreed. "Well, I'm calling it a night." 

"I'll see you in the morning." 

I waved. "See ya." 

"What happened to your arm?" 

I flushed and cursed silently. "I tripped. It's nothing." 

"Bella," he sighed, shaking his head. 

"Goodnight, Dad." 

I hurried up to the bathroom, where I kept my pajamas for just such nights as these. I 
shrugged into the matching tank top and cotton pants that I'd gotten to replace the holey 
sweats I used to wear to bed, wincing as the movement pulled at the stitches. I washed my 
face one-handed, brushed my teeth, and then skipped to my room. 




He was sitting in the center of my bed, toying idly with one of the silver boxes. 

"Hi," he said. His voice was sad. He was wallowing. 

I went to the bed, pushed the presents out of his hands, and climbed into his lap. 

"Hi." I snuggled into his stone chest. "Can I open my presents now?" 

"Where did the enthusiasm come from?" he wondered. 

"You made me curious." 

I picked up the long flat rectangle that must have been from Carlisle and Esme. 

"Allow me," he suggested. He took the gift from my hand and tore the silver paper off with 
one fluid movement. He handed the rectangular white box back to me. 

"Are you sure I can handle lifting the lid?" I muttered, but he ignored me. 

Inside the box was a long thick piece of paper with an overwhelming amount of fine print. It 
took me a minute to get the gist of the information. 

"We're going to Jacksonville?" And I was excited, in spite of myself. It was a voucher for 
plane tickets, for both me and Edward. 

"That's the idea." 

"I can't believe it. Renee is going to flip! You don't mind, though, do you? It's sunny, you'll 
have to stay inside all day." 

"I think I can handle it," he said, and then frowned. "If I'd had any idea that you could 
respond to a gift this appropriately, I would have made you open it in front of Carlisle and 
Esme. I thought you'd complain." 

"Well, of course it's too much. But I get to take you with me!" 

He chuckled. "Now I wish I'd spent money on your present. I didn't realize that you were 
capable of being reasonable." 

I set the tickets aside and reached for his present, my curiosity rekindled. He took it from me 
and unwrapped it l ik e the first one. 

He handed back a clear CD jewel case, with a blank silver CD inside. 

"What is it?" I asked, perplexed. 

He didn't say anything; he took the CD and reached around me to put it in the CD player on 
the bedside table. He hit play, and we waited in silence. Then the music began. 




I listened, speechless and wide-eyed. I knew he was waiting for my reaction, but I couldn't 
talk. Tears welled up, and I reached up to wipe them away before they could spill over. 

"Does your arm hurt?" he asked anxiously. 

"No, it's not my arm. It's beautiful, Edward. You couldn't have given me anything I would 
love more. I can't believe it." I shut up, so I could listen. 

It was his music, his compositions. The first piece on the CD was my lullaby. 

"I didn't think you would let me get a piano so I could play for you here," he explained. 

"You're right." 

"How does your arm feel?" 

"Just fine." Actually, it was starting to blaze under the bandage. I wanted ice. I would have 
settled for his hand, but that would have given me away. 

"I'll get you some Tylenol." 

"I don't need anything," I protested, but he slid me off his lap and headed for the door. 

"Charlie," I hissed. Charlie wasn't exactly aware that Edward frequently stayed over. In fact, 
he would have a stroke if that fact were brought to his attention. But I didn't feel too guilty 
for deceiving him It wasn't as if we were up to anything he wouldn't want me to be up to. 
Edward and his rules. . . 

"He won't catch me," Edward promised as he disappeared silently out the door . . and 
returned, catching the door before it had swung back to touch the frame. He had the glass 
from the bathroom and the bottle of pills in one hand. 

I took the pills he handed me without arguing-I knew I would lose the argument And my 
arm really was starting to bother me. 

My lullaby continued, soft and lovely, in the background. 

"It's late," Edward noted. He scooped me up off the bed with one arm, and pulled the cover 
back with the other. He put me down with my head on my pillow and tucked the quilt 
around me. He lay down next to me-on top of the blanket so I wouldn't get chilled-and put 
his arm over me. 

I leaned my head against his shoulder and sighed happily. 

"Thanks again," I whispered. 



You're welcome. 




It was quiet for a long moment as I listened to my lullaby drift to a close. Another song 
began. I recognized Esme's favorite. 

"What are you thinking about?'" I wondered in a whisper. 

He hesitated for a second before he told me. "I was thinking about right and wrong, 
actually." 

I felt a chill tingle along my spine. 

"Remember how I decided that I wanted you to not ignore my birthday?" I asked quickly, 
hoping it wasn't too clear that I was trying to distract him. 

"Yes," he agreed, wary. 

"Well, I was thinking, since it's still my birthday, that I'd l ik e you to kiss me again." 

"You're greedy tonight." 

"Yes, I am-but please, don't do anything you don’t want to do," I added, piqued. 

He laughed, and then sighed. "Heaven forbid that I should do anything I don't want to do," 
he said in a strangely desperate tone as he put his hand under my chin and pulled my face up 
to his. 

The kiss began much the same as usual-Edward was as careful as ever, and my heart began 
to overreact like it always did. And then something seemed to change. Suddenly his lips 
became much more urgent, his free hand twisted into my hair and held my face securely to 
his. And, though my hands tangled in his hair, too, and though I was clearly beginning to 
cross his cautious lines, for once he didn't stop me. His body was cold through the thin quilt, 
but I crushed myself against him eagerly. 

When he stopped it was abrupt; he pushed me away with gentle, firm hands. 

I collapsed back onto my pillow, gasping, my head spinning. Something tugged at my 
memory, elusive, on the edges. 

"Sorry," he said, and he was breathless, too. "That was out of line." 

"7 don't mind," I panted. 

He frowned at me in the darkness. "Try to sleep. Bella." 

"No, I want you to kiss me again." 

"You're overestimating my self-control." 

"Which is tempting you more, my blood or my body?" I challenged. 




"It's a tie." He grinned briefly in spite of himself, and then was serious again. "Now. why 
don't you stop pushing your luck and go to sleep?" 

"Fine," I agreed, snuggling closer to him. I really did feel exhausted. It had been a long day in 
so many ways, yet I felt no sense of relief at its end. Almost as if something worse was 
coming tomorrow. It was a silly premonition-what could be worse than today?' Just the 
shock catching up with me, no doubt. 

Trying to be sneaky about it, I pressed my injured arm against his shoulder, so his cool s ki n 
would sooth the burning. It felt better at once. 

I was halfway asleep, maybe more, when I realized what his kiss had reminded me of: last 
spring, when he'd had to leave me to throw James off my trail, Edward had kissed me 
goodbye, not knowing when-or if-we would see each other again. This kiss had the same 
almost painful edge for some reason I couldn't imagine. I shuddered into unconsciousness, as 
if I were already having a nightmare. 




3. THE END 



I FELT ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS IN THE MORNING. I HADN'T slept well; my arm 
burned and my head ached. It didn't help my outlook that Edward's face was smooth and 
remote as he kissed my forehead quickly and ducked out my window. I was afraid of the time 
I'd spent unconscious, afraid that he might have been thinking about right and wrong again 
while he watched me sleep. The anxiety seemed to ratchet up the intensity of the pounding 
in my head. 

Edward was waiting for me at school, as usual, but his face was still wrong. There was 
something buried in his eyes that I couldn't be sure of-and it scared me. I didn't want to bring 
up last night, but I wasn't sure if avoiding the subject would be worse. 

He opened my door for me. 

"How do you feel?" 

"Perfect," I lied, cringing as the sound of the slamming door echoed in my head. 

We walked in silence, he shortening his stride to match mine. There were so many questions 
I wanted to ask, but most of those questions would have to wait, because chey were for 
Alice: How was Jasper this morning? What had they said when I was gone? What had 
Rosalie said? And most importantly, what could she see happening now in her strange, 
imperfect visions of the future? Could she guess what Edward was thinking, why he was so 
gloomy? Was there a foundation for the tenuous, instinctive fears that I couldn't seem to 
shake? 

The morning passed slowly. I was impatient to see Alice, though I wouldn't be able to really 
talk to her with Edward there. Edward remained aloof. Occasionally he would ask about my 
arm, and I would he. 

Alice usually beat us to lunch; she didn't have to keep pace with a sloth l ik e me. But she 
wasn't at the table, waiting with a tray of food she wouldn't eat. 

Edward didn't say anything about her absence. I wondered to myself if her class was running 
late-until I saw Conner and Ben, who were in her fourth hour French class. 

"Where's Alice?" I asked Edward anxiously. 

He looked at the granola bar he was slowly pulverizing between his fingertips while he 
answered. "She's with Jasper." 

"Is he okay?" 

"He's gone away for a while." 



’What? Where?’ 




Edward shrugged. "Nowhere in particular. 



"And Alice, too," I said with quiet desperation. Of course, if Jasper needed her, she would 

go- 

"Yes. She'll be gone for a while. She was trying to convince him to go to Denali." 

Denali was where the one other band of unique vampires-good ones like the Cullens-lived. 
Tanya and her family. I'd heard of them now and again. Edward had run to them last winter 
when my arrival had made Forks difficult for him. Laurent, the most civilized member of 
James's little coven, had gone there rather than siding with James against the Cullens. It 
made sense for Alice to encourage Jasper to go there. 

I swallowed, trying to dislodge the sudden lump in my throat. The guilt made my head bow 
and my shoulders slump. I'd run them out of their home, just l ik e Rosalie and Emmett. I was 
a plague. 

"Is your arm bothering you?" he asked solicitously. 

"Who cares about my stupid arm?" I muttered in disgust. 

He didn't answer, and I put my head down on the table. 

By the end of the day, the silence was becoming ridiculous. I didn't want to be the one to 
break it, but apparently that was my only choice if I ever wanted him to talk to me again. 

"You'll come over later tonight?" I asked as he walked me-silently-to my truck. He always 
came over. 

"Later?" 

It pleased me that he seemed surprised. "I have to work. I had to trade with Mrs. Newton to 
get yesterday off." 

"Oh," he murmured. 

"So you'll come over when I'm home, though, right?" I hated that I felt suddenly unsure 
about this. 

"If you want me to." 

"I always want you," I reminded him, with perhaps a little more intensity than the 
conversation required. 

I expected he would laugh, or smile, or react somehow to my words. 

"All right, then," he said indifferently. 




He kissed my forehead again before he shut the door on me. Then he turned his back and 
loped gracefully toward his car. 



I was able to drive out of the parking lot before the panic really hit, but I was 
hyperventilating by the time I got to Newton's. 

He just needed time, I told myself. He would get over this. Maybe he was sad because his 
family was disappearing. But Alice and Jasper would come back soon, and Rosalie and 
Emmett, too. If it would help, I would stay away from the big white house on the river-I'd 
never set foot there again. That didn't matter. I'd still see Alice at school. She would have to 
come back for school, right? And she was at my place all the time anyway. She wouldn't 
want to hurt Charlie's feelings by staying away. 

No doubt I would also run into Carlisle with regularity-in the emergency room. 

After all, what had happened last night was nothing. Nothing had happened. So I fell 
down-that was the story of my life. Compared to last spring, it seemed especially 
unimportant. James had left me broken and nearly dead from loss of blood-and yet Edward 
had handled the interminable weeks in the hospital much better than this. Was it because, 
this time, it wasn't an enemy he'd had to protect me from? Because it was his brother? 

Maybe it would be better if he took me away, rather than his family being scattered. I grew 
slightly less depressed as I considered all the uninterrupted alone time. If he could just last 
through the school year, Charlie wouldn't be able to object. We could go away to college, or 
pretend that's what we were doing, like Rosalie and Emmett this year. Surely Edward could 
wait a year. What was a year to an immortal? It didn't even seem l ik e that much to me. 

I was able to talk myself into enough composure to handle getting out of the truck and 
walking to the store. Mike Newton had beaten me here today, and he smiled and waved 
when I came in. I grabbed my vest, nodding vaguely in his direction. I was still imagining 
pleasant scenarios that consisted of me running away with Edward to various exotic locales. 

Mike interrupted my fantasy. "How was your birthday?" 

"Ugh," I mumbled. "I'm glad it's over." 

Mike looked at me from the corners of his eyes l ik e I was crazy. 

Work dragged. I wanted to see Edward again, praying that he would be past the worst of 
this, whatever it was exactly, by the time I saw h im again. It's nothing, I told myself over and 
over again. Everything will go back to normal. 

The relief I felt when I turned onto my street and saw Edward's silver car parked in front of 
my house was an overwhelming, heady thing. And it bothered me deeply that it should be 
that way. 




I hurried through the front door, calling out before I was completely inside. 

"Dad? Edward?" 

As I spoke, I could hear the distinctive theme music from ESPN's SportsCenter coming from 
the living room. 

"In here," Charlie called. 

I hung my raincoat on its peg and hurried around the comer. 

Edward was in the armchair, my father on the sofa. Both had their eyes trained on the TV. 
The focus was normal for my father. Not so much for Edward. 

"Hi," I said weakly. 

"Hey, Bella," my father answered, eyes never moving. "We just had cold pizza. I think it's 
still on the table." 

"Okay." 

I waited in the doorway. Finally, Edward looked over at me with a polite smile. "I'll be right 
behind you," he promised. His eyes strayed back to the TV. 

I stared for another minute, shocked. Neither one seemed to notice. I could feel something, 
panic maybe, building up in my chest. I escaped to the kitchen. 

The pizza held no interest for me. I sat in my chair, pulled my knees up, and wrapped my 
arms around them. Something was very wrong, maybe more wrong than I'd realized. The 
sounds of male bonding and banter continued from the TV set. 

I tried to get control of myself, to reason with myself. 

What's the worst that can happen ? I flinched. That was definitely the wrong question to ask. 
I was having a hard time breathing right. 

Okay, I thought again, what's the worst 1 can live through ? I didn't like that question so 
much, either. But I thought through the possibilities I'd considered today. 

Staying away from Edward's family. Of course, he wouldn't expect Alice to be part of that. 
But if Jasper was off limits, that would lessen the time I could have with her. I nodded to 
myself-I could live with that. 

Or going away. Maybe he wouldn't want to wait till the end of the school year, maybe it 
would have to be now. 



In front of me, on the table, my presents from Charlie and Renee were where I had left them, 
the camera I hadn't had the chance to use at the Cullens' sitting beside the album. I touched 




the pretty cover of the scrapbook my mother had given me, and sighed, thinking of Renee. 
Somehow, living without her for as long as I had did not make the idea of a more permanent 
separation easier. And Charlie would be left all alone here, abandoned. They would both be 
so hurt... 

But we'd come back, right? We'd visit, of course, wouldn't we? 

I couldn't be certain about the answer to that. 

I leaned my cheek against my knee, staring at the physical tokens of my parents' love. I'd 
known this path I'd chosen was going to be hard. And, after all, I was thinking about the 
worst-case scenario-the very worst I could live through. 

I touched the scrapbook again, flipping the front cover over. Little metal corners were 
already in place to hold the first picture. It wasn't a half-bad idea, to make some record of my 
life here. I felt a strange urge to get started. Maybe I didn't have that long left in Forks. 

I toyed with the wrist strap on the camera, wondering about the first picture on the roll. 
Could it possibly turn out anything close to the original? I doubted it. But he didn't seem 
worried that it would be blank. I chuckled to myself, thinking of his carefree laughter last 
night. The chuckle died away. So much had changed, and so abruptly. It made me feel a little 
bit dizzy, l ik e I was standing on an edge, a precipice somewhere much too high. 

I didn't want to think about that anymore. I grabbed the camera and headed up the stairs. 

My room hadn't really changed all that much in the seventeen years since my mother had 
been here. The walls were still light blue, the same yellowed lace curtains hung in front of 
the window. There was a bed, rather than a crib, but she would recognize the quilt draped 
untidily over the top-it had been a gift ROM Gran. 

Regardless, I snapped a picture of my room. There wasn't much else I could do tonight-it 
was too dark outside-and the feeling was growing stronger, it was almost a compulsion now. 
I would record everything about Forks before I had to leave it. 

Change was coming. I could feel it. It wasn't a pleasant prospect, not when life was perfect 
the way it was. 

I took my time coming back down the stairs, camera in hand, trying to ignore the butterflies 
in my stomach as I thought of the strange distance I didn't want to see in Edward's eyes. He 
would get over this. Probably he was worried that I would be upset when he asked me to 
leave. I would let him work through it without meddling. And I would be prepared when he 
asked. 

I had the camera ready as I leaned around the corner, being sneaky. I was sure there was no 
chance that I had caught Edward by surprise, but he didn't look up. I felt a brief shiver as 
something icy twisted in my stomach; I ignored that and took the picture. 




They both looked at me then. Charlie frowned. Edward's face was empty, expressionless. 
"What are you doing, Bella?" Charlie complained. 

"Oh, come on." I pretended to smile as I went to sit on the floor in front of the sofa where 
Charlie lounged. "You know Mom will be calling soon to ask if I'm using my presents. I have 
to get to work before she can get her feelings hurt." 

"Why are you taking pictures of me, though?" he grumbled. 

"Because you're so handsome," I replied, keeping it light. "And because, since you bought the 
camera, you're obligated to be one of my subjects." 

He mumbled something unintelligible. 

"Hey, Edward," I said with admirable indifference. "Take one of me and my dad together." 

I threw the camera toward him, carefully avoiding his eyes, and knelt beside the arm of the 
sofa where Charlie's face was. Charlie sighed. 

"You need to smile, Bella," Edward murmured. 

I did my best, and the camera flashed. 

"Let me take one of you kids," Charlie suggested. I knew he was just trying to shift the 
camera's focus from himself. 

Edward stood and lightly tossed him the camera. 

I went to stand beside Edward, and the arrangement felt formal and strange to me. He put 
one hand lightly on my shoulder, and I wrapped my arm more securely around his waist. I 
wanted to look at his face, but I was afraid to. 

"Smile, Bella," Charlie reminded me again. 

I took a deep breath and smiled. The flash blinded me. 

"Enough pictures for tonight," Charlie said then, shoving the camera into a crevice of the 
sofa cushions and rolling over it. "You don't have to use the whole roll now." 

Edward dropped his hand from my shoulder and twisted casually out of my arm. He sat back 
down in the armchair. 

I hesitated, and then went to sit against the sofa again. I was suddenly so frightened that my 
hands were shaking. I pressed them into my stomach to hide them, put my chin on my knees 
and stared at the TV screen in front of me, seeing nothing. 



When the show ended, I hadn't moved an inch. Out of the comer of my eye, I saw Edward 




stand. 



"I'd better get home," he said. 

Charlie didn't look up from the commercial. "See ya." 

I got awkwardly to my feet-I was stiff from sitting so still-and followed Edward out the 
front door. He went straight to his car. 

"Will you stay?" I asked, no hope in my voice. 

I expected his answer, so it didn't hurt as much. 

"Not tonight." 

I didn't ask for a reason. 

He got in his car and drove away while I stood there, unmoving. I barely noticed that it was 
raining. I waited, without knowing what I waited for, until the door opened behind me. 

"Bella, what are you doing?" Charlie asked, surprised to see me standing there alone and 
dripping. 

"Nothing." I turned and trudged back to the house. 

It was a long night, with little in the way of rest. 

I got up as soon as there was a faint light outside my window. I dressed for school 
mechanically, waiting for the clouds to brighten. When I had eaten a bowl of cereal, I 
decided that it was light enough for pictures. I took one of my truck, and then the front of 
the house. I turned and snapped a few of the forest by Charlie's house. Funny how it didn't 
seem sinister l ik e it used to. I realized I would miss this-the green, the timelessness, the 
mystery of the woods. All of it. 

I put the camera in my school bag before I left. I tried to concentrate on my new project 
rather than the fact that Edward apparently hadn't gotten over things during the night. 

Along with the fear, I was beginning to feel impatience. How long could this last? 

It lasted through the morning. He walked silently beside me, never seeming to actually look 
at me. I tried to concentrate on my classes, but not even English could hold my attention. Mr. 
Berty had to repeat his question about Lady Capulet twice before I realized he was talking to 
me. Edward whispered the correct answer under his breath and then went back to ignoring 
me. 



At lunch, the silence continued. I felt l ik e I was going to start screaming at any moment, so, 
to distract myself, I leaned across the table's invisible line and spoke to Jessica. 




"Hey, Jess?" 

"What's up, Bella?" 

"Could you do me a favor?" I asked, reaching into my bag. "My mom wants me to get some 
pictures of my friends for a scrapbook. So, take some pictures of everybody, okay?" 

I handed her the camera. 

"Sure," she said, grinning, and turned to snap a candid shot of Mike with his mouth full. 

A predictable picture war ensued. I watched them hand the camera around the table, giggling 
and flirting and complaining about being on film. It seemed strangely childish. Maybe I just 
wasn't in the mood for normal human behavior today. 

"Uh-oh," Jessica said apologetically as she returned the camera. "I think we used all your 
film." 

"That's okay. I think I already got pictures of everything else I needed." 

After school, Edward walked me back to the parking lot in silence. I had to work again, and 
for once, I was glad. Time with me obviously wasn't helping things. Maybe time alone would 
be better. 

I dropped my film off at the Thriftway on my way to Newton's, and then picked up the 
developed pictures after work. At home, I said a brief hi to Charlie, grabbed a granola bar 
from the kitchen, and hurried up to my room with the envelope of photographs tucked under 
my arm. 

I sat in the middle of my bed and opened the envelope with wary curiosity. Ridiculously, I 
still half expected the first print to be a blank. 

When I pulled it out, I gasped aloud. Edward looked just as beautiful as he did in real life, 
staring at me out of the picture with the warm eyes I'd missed for the past few days. It was 
almost uncanny that anyone could look so... so... beyond description. No thousand words 
could equal this picture. 

I flipped through the rest of the stack quickly once, and then laid three of them out on the 
bed side by side. 

The first was the picture of Edward in the kitchen, his warm eyes touched with tolerant 
amusement. The second was Edward and Charlie, watching ESPN. The difference in 
Edward's expression was severe. His eyes were careful here, reserved. Still breathtakingly 
beautiful, but his face was colder, more l ik e a sculpture, less alive. 

The last was the picture of Edward and me standing awkwardly side by side. Edward's face 
was the same as the last, cold and statue-like. But that wasn't the most troubling part of this 




photograph. The contrast between the two of us was painful. He looked like a god. I looked 
very average, even for a human, almost shamefully plain. I flipped the picture over with a 
feeling of disgust. 

Instead of doing my homework, I stayed up to put my pictures into the album. With a 
ballpoint pen I scrawled captions under all the pictures, the names and the dates. I got to the 
picture of Edward and me, and, without looking at it too long, I folded it in half and stuck it 
under the metal tab, Edward-side up. 

When I was done, I stuffed the second set of prints in a fresh envelope and penned a long 
thank-you letter to Renee. 

Edward still hadn't come over. I didn't want to admit that he was the reason I'd stayed up so 
late, but of course he was. I tried to remember the last time he'd stayed away l ik e this, 
without an excuse, a phone call. . . He never had. 

Again, I didn't sleep well. 

School followed the silent, frustrating, terrifying pattern of the last two days. I felt relief 
when I saw Edward waiting for me in the parking lot, but it faded quickly. He was no 
different, unless maybe more remote. 

It was hard to even remember the reason for all this mess. My birthday already felt l ik e the 
distant past. If only Alice would come back. Soon. Before this got any more out of hand. 

But I couldn't count on that. I decided that, if I couldn't talk to him today, really talk, then I 
was going to see Carlisle tomorrow. I had to do something. 

After school, Edward and I were going to talk it out, I promised myself. I wasn't accepting 
any excuses. 

He walked me to my truck, and I steeled myself to make my demands. 

"Do you mind if I come over today?" he asked before we got to the truck, beating me to the 
punch. 

"Of course not." 

"Now?" he asked again, opening my door for me. 

"Sure," I kept my voice even, though I didn't like the urgency in his tone. "I was just going to 
drop a letter for Renee in the mailbox on the way. I'll meet you there." 

He looked at the fat envelope on the passenger seat. Suddenly, he reached over me and 
snagged it. 

"I'll do it," he said quietly. "And I'll still beat you there." He smiled my favorite crooked smile, 




but it was wrong. It didn't reach his eyes. 

"Okay," I agreed, unable to smile back. He shut the door, and headed toward his car. 

He did beat me home. He was parked in Charlie's spot when I pulled up in front of the 
house. That was a bad sign. He didn't plan to stay, then. I shook my head and took a deep 
breath, trying to locate some courage. 

He got out of his car when I stepped out of the truck, and came to meet me. He reached to 
take my book bag from me. That was normal. But he shoved it back onto the seat. That was 
not normal. 

"Come for a walk with me," he suggested in an unemotional voice, taking my hand. 

I didn't answer. I couldn't think of a way to protest, but I instantly knew that I wanted to. I 
didn't like this. This is bad, this is very bad , the voice in my head repeated again and again. 

But he didn't wait for an answer. He pulled me along toward the east side of the yard, where 
the forest encroached. I followed unwillingly, trying to think through the panic. It was what I 
wanted, I reminded myself. The chance to talk it all through. So why was the panic choking 
me? 

We'd gone only a few steps into the trees when he stopped. We were barely on the trail— I 
could still see the house. 

Some walk. 

Edward leaned against a tree and stared at me, his expression unreadable. 

"Okay, let's talk," I said. It sounded braver than it felt. 

He took a deep breath. 

"Bella, we're leaving." 

I took a deep breath, too. This was an acceptable option. I thought I was prepared. But I still 
had to ask. 

"Why now? Another year-" 

"Bella, it's time. How much longer could we stay in Forks, after all? Carlisle can barely pass 
for thirty, and he's claiming thirty-three now. We'd have to start over soon regardless." 

His answer confused me. I thought the point of leaving was to let his family live in peace. 
Why did we have to leave if they were going? I stared at him, trying to understand what he 
meant. 



He stared back coldly. 




With a roll of nausea, I realized I'd misunderstood. 

"When you say we-," I whispered. 

"I mean my family and myself." Each word separate and distinct. 

I shook my head back and forth mechanically, trying to clear it. He waited without any sign 
of impatience. It took a few minutes before I could speak. 

"Okay," I said. "I'll come with you." 

"You can't, Bella. Where we're going. . . It's not the right place for you." 

"Where you are is the right place for me." 

"I'm no good for you, Bella." 

"Don't be ridiculous." I wanted to sound angry, but it just sounded like I was begging. 
"You're the very best part of my life." 

"My world is not for you," he said grimly. 

"What happened with Jasper-that was nothing, Edward! Nothing!" 

"You're right," he agreed. "It was exactly what was to be expected." 

"You promised! In Phoenix, you promised that you would stay-" 

"As long as that was best for you," he interrupted to correct me. 

'Wo! This is about my soul, isn't it?" I shouted, furious, the words exploding out of 
me-somehow it still sounded like a plea. "Carlisle told me about that, and I don't care, 
Edward. I don't care! You can have my soul. I don't want it without you-it's yours already!" 

He took a deep breath and stared, unseeingly, at the ground for a long moment. His mouth 
twisted the tiniest bit. When he finally looked up, his eyes were different, harder-l ik e the 
liquid gold had frozen solid. 

"Bella, I don't want you to come with me." He spoke the words slowly and precisely, his cold 
eyes on my face, watching as I absorbed what he was really saying. 

There was a pause as I repeated the words in my head a few times, sifting through them for 
their real intent. 

"You... don't... want me?" I tried out the words, confused by the way they sounded, placed 
in that order. 



’No. 




I stared, uncomprehending, into his eyes. He stared back without apology. His eyes were l ik e 
topaz-hard and clear and very deep. I felt l ik e I could see into them for miles and miles, yet 
nowhere in rheir bottomless depths could I see a contradiction to the word he'd spoken. 

"Well, that changes things." I was surprised by how calm and reasonable my voice sounded. 
It must be because I was so numb. I couldn't realize what he was telling me. It still didn't 
make any sense. 

He looked away into the trees as he spoke again. "Of course, I'll always love you... in a way. 
But what happened the other night made me realize that it's time for a change. Because 
I'm... tired of pretending to be something I'm not, Bella. I am not human." He looked back, 
and the icy planes of his perfect face were not human. "I've let this go on much too long, and 
I'm sorry for that." 

"Don't." My voice was just a whisper now; awareness was beginning to seep through me, 
trickling l ik e acid through my veins. "Don't do this." 

He just stared at me, and I could see from his eyes that my words were far too late. He 
already had. 

"You're not good for me, Bella." He turned his earlier words around, and so I had no 
argument. How well I knew that I wasn't good enough for him. 

I opened my mouth to say something, and then closed it again. He waited patiently, his face 
wiped clean of all emotion. I tried again. 

"If... that's what you want." 

He nodded once. 

My whole body went numb. I couldn't feel anything below the neck. 

"I would like to ask one favor, though, if that's not too much," he said. 

I wonder what he saw on my face, because something flickered across his own face in 
response. But, before I could identify it, he'd composed his features into the same serene 
mask. 

"Anything," I vowed, my voice faintly stronger. 

As I watched, his frozen eyes melted. The gold became liquid again, molten, burning down 
into mine with an intensity that was overwhelming. 

"Don't do anything reckless or stupid," he ordered, no longer detached. "Do you understand 
what I'm saying?" 



I nodded helplessly. 




His eyes cooled, the distance returned. "I'm thinking of Charlie, of course. He needs you. 
Take care of yourself-for him." 

I nodded again. "I will," I whispered. 

He seemed to relax just a little. 

"And I'll make you a promise in return," he said. "I promise that this will be the last time 
you'll see me. I won't come back. I won't put you through anything like this again. You can 
go on with your life without any more interference from me. It will be as if I'd never existed." 

My knees must have started to shake, because the trees were suddenly wobbling. I could hear 
the blood pounding faster than normal behind my ears. His voice sounded farther away. 

He smiled gently. "Don't worry. You're human-your memory is no more than a sieve. Time 
heals all wounds for your kind." 

"And your memories?" I asked. It sounded like there was something stuck in my throat, l ik e I 
was choking. 

"Well"-he hesitated for a short second-"I won't forget. But my kind... we're very easily 
distracted." He smiled; the smile was tranquil and it did not touch his eyes. 

He took a step away from me. "That's everything, I suppose. We won't bother you again." 

The plural caught my attention. That surprised me; I would have thought I was beyond 
noticing anything. 

"Alice isn't coming back," I realized. I don't know how he heard me-the words made no 
sound-but he seemed to understand. 

He shook his head slowly, always watching my face. 

"No. They're all gone. I staved behind to tell you goodbye." 

"Alice is gone?" My voice was blank with disbelief. 

"She wanted to say goodbye, but I convinced her that a clean break would be better for you." 

I was dizzy; it was hard to concentrate. His words swirled around in my head, and I heard the 
doctor at the hospital in Phoenix, last spring, as he showed me the X-rays. You can see it's a 
clean break, his finger traced along the picture of my severed bone. That's good. It will heal 
more easily, more quickly. 

I tried to breathe normally. I needed to concentrate, to find a way out of this nightmare. 
"Goodbye, Bella," he said in the same quiet, peaceful voice. 




"Wait!" I choked out the word, reaching for him, willing my deadened legs to carry me 
forward. 



I thought he was reaching for me, too. But his cold hands locked around my wrists and 
pinned them to my sides. He leaned down, and pressed his lips very lightly to my forehead for 
the briefest instant. My eyes closed. 

"Take care of yourself," he breathed, cool against my skin. 

There was a light, unnatural breeze. My eyes flashed open. The leaves on a small vine maple 
shuddered with the gentle wind of his passage. 

He was gone. 

With shaky legs, ignoring the fact that my action was useless, I followed him into the forest. 
The evidence of his path had disappeared instantly. There were no footprints, the leaves were 
still again, but I walked forward without thinking. I could not do anything else. I had to keep 
moving. If I stopped looking for him, it was over. 

Love, life, meaning. . . over. 

I walked and walked. Time made no sense as I pushed slowly through the thick 
undergrowth. It was hours passing, but also only seconds. Maybe it felt l ik e time had frozen 
because the forest looked the same no matter how far I went. I started to worry that I was 
traveling in a circle, a very small circle at that, but I kept going. I stumbled often, and, as it 
grew darker and darker, I fell often, too. 

Finally, I tripped over something-it was black now, I had no idea what caught my foot-and I 
stayed down. I rolled onto my side, so that I could breathe, and curled up on the wet bracken. 

As I lay there, I had a feeling that more time was passing than I realized. I couldn't remember 
how long it had been since nightfall. Was it always so dark here at night? Surely, as a rule, 
some little bit of moonlight would filter down through the clouds, through the chinks in the 
canopy of trees, and find the ground. 

Not tonight. Tonight the sky was utterly black. Perhaps there was no moon tonight-a lunar 
eclipse, a new moon. 

A new moon. I shivered, though I wasn't cold. 

It was black for a long time before I heard them calling. 

Someone was shouting my name. It was muted, muffled by the wet growth that surrounded 
me, but it was definitely my name. I didn't recognize the voice. I thought about answering, 
but I was dazed, and it took a long time to come to the conclusion that I should answer. By 
then, the calling had stopped. 




Sometime later, the rain woke me up. I don't think I'd really fallen asleep; I was just lost in an 
unthinking stupor, holding with all my strength to the numbness that kept me from realizing 
what I didn't want to know. 

The rain bothered me a little. It was cold. I unwrapped my arms from around my legs to 
cover my face. 

It was then that I heard the calling again. It was farther away this time, and sometimes it 
sounded l ik e several voices were calling at once. I tried to breathe deeply. I remembered that 
I should answer, but I didn't think they would be able to hear me. Would I be able to shout 
loud enough? 

Suddenly, there was another sound, startlingly close. A kind of snuffling, an animal sound. It 
sounded big. I wondered if I should feel afraid. I didn't-just numb. It didn't matter. The 
snuffling went away. 

The rain continued, and I could feel the water pooling up against my cheek. I was trying to 
gather the strength to turn my head when I saw the light. 

At first it was just a dim glow reflecting off the bushes in the distance. It grew brighter and 
brighter, illuminating a large space unl ik e the focused beam of a flashlight. The light broke 
through the closest brush, and I could see that it was a propane lantern, but that was all I 
could see-the brightness blinded me for a moment. 

"Bella." 

The voice was deep and unfamiliar, but full of recognition. He wasn't calling my name to 
search, he was acknowledging that I was found. 

I stared up-impossibly high it seemed-at the dark face that I could now see above me. I was 
vaguely aware that the stranger probably only looked so tall because my head was still on the 
ground. 

"Have you been hurt?" 

I knew the words meant something, but I could only stare, bewildered. How could the 
meaning matter at this point? 

"Bella, my name is Sam Uley." 

There was nothing familiar about his name. 

"Charlie sent me to look for you." 

Charlie? That struck a chord, and I tried to pay more attention to what he was saying. 
Charlie mattered, if nothing else did. 




The tall man held out a hand. I gazed at it, not sure what I was supposed to do. 



His black eyes appraised me for a second, and then he shrugged. In a quick and supple 
notion, he pulled me up from the ground and into his arms. 

I hung there, limp, as he loped swiftly through the wet forest. Some part of me knew this 
should upset me-being carried away by a stranger. But there was nothing left in me to upset. 

It didn't seem like too much time passed before there were lights and the deep babble of 
many male voices. Sam Uley slowed as he approached the commotion. 

"I've got her!" he called in a booming voice. 

The babble ceased, and then picked up again with more intensity. A confusing swirl of faces 
moved over me. Sam's voice was the only one that made sense in the chaos, perhaps because 
my ear was against his chest. 

"No, I don't think she's hurt," he told someone. "She just keeps saying 'He's gone.' " 

Was I saying that out loud? I bit down on my lip. 

"Bella, honey, are you all right?" 

That was one voice I would know anywhere-even distorted, as it was now, with worry. 
"Charlie?" My voice sounded strange and small. 

"I'm right here, baby." 

There was a shifting under me, followed by the leathery smell of my dad's sheriff jacket. 
Charlie staggered under my weight. 

"Maybe I should hold on to her," Sam Uley suggested. 

"I've got her," Charlie said, a little breathless. 

He walked slowly, struggling. I wished I could tell him to put me down and let me walk, but 
I couldn't find my voice. 

There were lights everywhere, held by the crowd walking with him. It felt l ik e a parade. Or a 
funeral procession. I closed my eyes. 

"We're almost home now, honey," Charlie mumbled now and then. 

I opened my eyes again when I heard the door unlock. We were on the porch of our house, 
and the tall dark man named Sam was holding the door for Charlie, one arm extended toward 
us, as if he was preparing to catch me when Charlie's arms failed. 




But Charlie managed to get me through the door and to the couch in the living room. 

"Dad, I'm all wet," I objected feebly. 

"That doesn't matter." His voice was gruff. And then he was talking to someone else. 
"Blankets are in the cupboard at the top of the stairs." 

"Bella?" a new voice asked. I looked at the gray-haired man leaning over me, and recognition 
came after a few slow seconds. 

"Dr. Gerandy?" I mumbled. 

"That's right, dear," he said. "Are you hurt, Bella?" 

It took me a minute to think that through. I was confused by the memory of Sam Uley's 
similar question in the woods. Only Sam had asked something else: Have you been hurt ? he'd 
said. The difference seemed significant somehow. 

Dr. Gerandy was waiting. One grizzled eyebrow rose, and the wrinkles on his forehead 
deepened. 

"I'm not hurt," I lied. The words, were true enough for what he'd asked. 

His warm hand touched my forehead, and his fingers pressed against the inside of my wrist. I 
watched his lips as he counted to himself, his eyes on his watch. 

"What happened to you?" he asked casually. 

I froze under his hand, tasting panic in the back of my throat. 

"Did you get lost in the woods?" he prodded. I was aware of several other people listening. 
Three tall men with dark faces-from La Push, the Quileute Indian reservation down on the 
coastline, I guessed-Sam Uley among them, were standing very close together and staring at 
me. Mr. Newton was there with Mike and Mr. Weber, Angela's father; they all were 
watching me more surreptitiously than the strangers. Other deep voices rumbled from the 
kitchen and outside the front door. Half the town must have been looking for me. 

Charlie was the closest. He leaned in to hear my answer. 

"Yes," I whispered. "I got lost." 

The doctor nodded, thoughtful, his fingers probing gently against the glands under my jaw. 
Charlie's face hardened. 

"Do you feel tired?" Dr. Gerandy asked. 

I nodded and closed my eyes obediently. 




"I don't think there's anything wrong with her," I heard the doctor mutter to Charlie after a 
moment. "Just exhaustion. Let her sleep it off, and I'll come check on her tomorrow," he 
paused. He must have looked at his watch, because he added, "Well, later today actually." 

There was a creaking sound as they both pushed off from the couch to get to their feet. 

"Is it true?" Charlie whispered. Their voices were farther away now. I strained to hear. "Did 
they leave?" 

"Dr. Cullen asked us not to say anything," Dr. Gerandy answered. "The offer was very 
sudden; they had to choose immediately. Carlisle didn't want to make a big production out of 
leaving." 

"A little warning might have been nice," Charlie grumbled. 

Dr. Gerandy sounded uncomfortable when he replied. "Yes, well, in this situation, some 
warning might have been called for." 

I didn't want to listen anymore. I felt around for the edge of the quilt someone had laid on 
top of me, and pulled it over my ear. 

I drifted in and out of alertness. I heard Charlie whisper thanks to the volunteers as, one by 
one, they left. I felt his fingers on my forehead, and then the weight of another blanket. The 
phone rang a few times, and he hurried to catch it before it could wake me. He muttered 
reassurances in a low voice to the callers. 

"Yeah, we found her. She's okay. She got lost. She's fine now," he said again and again. 

I heard the springs in the armchair groan when he settled himself in for the night. 

A few minutes later, the phone rang again. 

Charlie moaned as he struggled to his feet, and then he rushed, stumbling, to the kitchen I 
pulled my head deeper under the blankets, not wanting to listen to the same conversation 
again. 

"Yeah," Charlie said, and yawned. 

His voice changed, it was much more alert when he spoke again. "Where?"' There was a 
pause. "You're sure it's outside the reservation?" Another short pause. "But what could be 
burning out there?' He sounded both worried and mystified. "Look, I'll call down there and 
check it out." 

I listened with more interest as he punched in a number. 

"Hey, Billy, it's Charlie-sorry I'm calling so early... no, she's fine. She's sleeping... Thanks, 
but that's not why I called. I just got a call from Mrs. Stanley, and she says that from her 




second-story window she can see fires out on the sea cliffs, but I didn't really... Oh!" 
Suddenly there was an edge in his voice-irritation. . . or anger. "And why are they doing that? 
Uh huh. Really?" He said it sarcastically. "Well, don't apologize to me. Yeah, yeah. Just 
make sure the flames don't spread... I know, I know, I'm surprised they got them lit at all in 
this weather." 

Charlie hesitated, and then added grudgingly. "Thanks for sending Sam and the other boys 
up. You were right-they do know the forest better than we do. It was Sam who found her, 
so I owe you one. . . Yeah, I'll talk to you later," he agreed, still sour, before hanging up. 

Charlie muttered something incoherent as he shuffled back to the living room. 

"What's wrong?" I asked. 

He hurried to my side. 

"I'm sorry I woke you, honey." 

"Is something burning?" 

"It's nothing," he assured me. "Just some bonfires out on the cliffs." 

"Bonfires?" I asked. My voice didn't sound curious. It sounded dead. 

Charlie frowned. "Some of the kids from the reservation being rowdy," he explained. 

"Why?" I wondered dully. 

I could tell he didn't want to answer. He looked at the floor under his knees. "They're 
celebrating the news." His tone was bitter. 

There was only one piece of news I could think of, try as I might not to. And then the pieces 
snapped together. "Because the Cullens left," I whispered. "They don't like the Cullens in La 
Push-I'd forgotten about that." 

The Quileutes had their superstitions about the "cold ones," the blood-drinkers that were 
enemies to their tribe, just l ik e they had their legends of the great flood and wolf-men 
ancestors. Just stories, folklore, to most of them. Then there were the few that believed. 
Charlie's good friend Billy Black believed, though even Jacob, his own son, thought he was 
full of stupid superstitions. Billy had warned me to stay away from the Cullens. . . 

The name stirred something inside me, something that began to claw its way toward the 
surface, something I knew I didn't want to face. 

"It's ridiculous," Charlie spluttered. 

We sat in silence for a moment. The sky was no longer black outside the window. 
Somewhere behind the rain, the sun was beginning to rise. 




Bella?" Charlie asked. 



I looked at him uneasily. 

"He left you alone in the woods?" Charlie guessed. 

I deflected his question. "How did you know where to find me?" My mind shied away from 
the inevitable awareness that was coming, coming quickly now. 

"Your note," Charlie answered, surprised. He reached into the back pocket of his jeans and 
pulled out a much-abused piece of paper. It was dirty and damp, with multiple creases from 
being opened and refolded many times. He unfolded it again, and held it up as evidence. The 
messy handwriting was remarkably close to my own. 

Going for a walk with Edward, up the path , it said. Back soon, B. 

"When you didn't come back, I called the Cullens, and no one answered," Charlie said in a 
low voice. "Then I called the hospital, and Dr. Gerandy told me that Carlisle was gone." 

"Where did they go?" I mumbled. 

He stared at me. "Didn't Edward tell you?" 

I shook my head, recoiling. The sound of his name unleashed the thing that was clawing 
inside of me-a pain that knocked me breathless, astonished me with its force. 

Charlie eyed me doubtfully as he answered. "Carlisle took a job with a big hospital in Los 
Angeles. I guess they threw a lot of money at him." 

Sunny L.A. The last place they would really go. I remembered my nightmare with the 
mirror... the bright sunlight shimmering off of his s ki n- 

Agony ripped through me with the memory of his face. 

"I want to know if Edward left you alone out there in the middle of the woods," Charlie 
insisted. 

His name sent another wave of torture through me. I shook my head, frantic, desperate to 
escape the pain. "It was my fault. He left me right here on the trail, in sight of the house... 
but I tried to follow him." 

Charlie started to say something; childishly, I covered my ears. "I can't talk about this 
anymore, Dad. I want to go to my room." 

Before he could answer, I scrambled up from the couch and lurched my way up the stairs. 

Someone had been in the house to leave a note for Charlie, a note that would lead him to 
find me. From the minute that I'd realized this, a horrible suspicion began to grow in my 




head. I rushed to my room, shutting and locking the door behind me before I ran to the CD 
player by my bed. 

Everything looked exactly the same as I'd left it. I pressed down on the top of the CD player. 
The latch unhooked, and the lid slowly swung open. 

It was empty. 

The album Renee had given me sat on the floor beside the bed, just where I'd put it last. I 
lifted the cover with a shaking hand. 

I didn't have to flip any farther than the first page. The little metal corners no longer held a 
picture in place. The page was blank except for my own handwriting scrawled across the 
bottom: Edward Cullen, Charlie's kitchen, Sept. 13th. 

I stopped there. I was sure that he would have been very thorough. 

It will be as if I'd never existed , he'd promised me. 

I felt the smooth wooden floor beneath my knees, and then the palms of my hands, and then 
it was pressed against the skin of my cheek. I hoped that I was fainting, but, to my 
disappointment, I didn't lose consciousness. The waves of pain that had only lapped at me 
before now reared high up and washed over my head, pulling me under. 

I did not resurface.

4. WAKING UP 



TIME PASSES. EVEN WHEN IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE. EVEN when each tick of the 
second hand aches like the pulse of blood behind a bruise. It passes unevenly, in strange 
lurches and dragging lulls, but pass it does. Even for me. 



CHARLIE'S FIST CAME DOWN ON THE TABLE. "THAT'S IT, Bella! I'm sending you 
home." 

I looked up from my cereal, which I was pondering rather than eating, and stared at Charlie 
in shock. I hadn't been following the conversation-actually, I hadn't been aware that we 
were having a conversation-and I wasn't sure what he meant. 

"I am home," I mumbled, confused. 

"I'm sending you to Renee, to Jacksonville," he clarified. 

Charlie watched with exasperation as I slowly grasped the meaning of his words. 

"What did I do?" I felt my face crumple. It was so unfair. My behavior had been above 
reproach for the past four months. After that first week, which neither of us ever mentioned, 
I hadn't missed a day of school or work. My grades were perfect. I never broke curfew-I 
never went anywhere from which to break curfew in the first place. I only very rarely served 
leftovers. 

Charlie was scowling. 

"You didn't do anything. That's the problem. You never do anything." 

"You want me to get into trouble?" I wondered, my eyebrows pulling together in 
mystification. I made an effort to pay attention. It wasn't easy. I was so used to tuning 
everything out, my ears felt stopped up. 

"Trouble would be better than this. . . this moping around all the time!" 

That stung a bit. I'd been careful to avoid all forms of moroseness, moping included. 

"I am not moping around." 

"Wrong word," he grudgingly conceded. "Moping would be better-that would be doing 
something. You're just. . . lifeless, Bella. I think that's the word I want." 

This accusation struck home. I sighed and tried to put some animation into my response. 




"I'm sorry, Dad." My apology sounded a little flat, even to me. I'd thought I'd been fooling 
him. Keeping Charlie from suffering was the whole point of all this effort. How depressing to 
think that the effort had been wasted. 

"I don't want you to apologize." 

I sighed. "Then tell me what you do want me to do." 

"Bella," he hesitated, scrutinizing my reaction to his next words. "Honey, you're not the first 
person to go through this kind of thing, you know." 

"I know that." My accompanying grimace was limp and unimpressive. 

"Listen, honey. I think that-that maybe you need some help." 

"Help?" 

He paused, searching for the words again. "When your mother left," he began, frowning, 
"and took you with her." He inhaled deeply. "Well, that was a really bad time for me." 

"I know, Dad," I mumbled. 

"But I handled it," he pointed out. "Honey, you're not handling it. I waited, I hoped it would 
get better." He stared at me and I looked down quickly. "I think we both know it's not 
getting better." 

"I'm fine." 

He ignored me. "Maybe, well, maybe if you talked to someone about it. A professional." 

"You want me to see a shrink?" My voice was a shade sharper as I realized what he was 
getting at. 

"Maybe it would help." 

"And maybe it wouldn't help one little bit." 

I didn't know much about psychoanalysis, but I was pretty sure that it didn't work unless the 
subject was relatively honest. Sure, I could tell the truth-if I wanted to spend the rest of my 
life in a padded cell. 

He examined my obstinate expression, and switched to another line of attack. 

"It's beyond me, Bella. Maybe your mother-" 

"Look," I said in a flat voice. "I'll go out tonight, if you want. I'll call Jess or Angela." 

"That's not what I want," he argued, frustrated. "I don't think I can live through seeing you 




try harder. I've never seen anyone trying so hard. It hurts to watch." 

I pretended to be dense, looking down at the table. "I don't understand, Dad. First you're 
mad because I'm not doing anything, and then you say you don't want me to go out." 

"I want you to be happy-no, not even that much. I just want you not to be miserable. I think 
you'll have a better chance if you get out of Forks." 

My eyes flashed up with the first small spark of feeling I'd had in too long to contemplate. 
"I'm not leaving," I said. 

"Why not?" he demanded. 

"I'm in my last semester of school-it would screw everything up." 

"You're a good student-you'll figure it out." 

"I don't want to crowd Mom and Phil." 

"Your mother's been dying to have you back." 

"Florida is too hot." 

His fist came down on the table again. "We both know what's really going on here, Bella, 
and it's not good for you." He took a deep breath. "It's been months. No calls, no letters, no 
contact. You can't keep waiting for him." 

I glowered at him. The heat almost, but not quite, reached my face. It had been a long time 
since I'd blushed with any emotion. 

This whole subject was utterly forbidden, as he was well aware. 

"I'm not waiting for anything. I don't expect anything," I said in a low monotone. 

"Bella-," Charlie began, his voice thick. 

"I have to get to school," I interrupted, standing up and yanking my untouched breakfast 
from the table. I dumped my bowl in the sink without pausing to wash it out. I couldn't deal 
with any more conversation. 

"I'll make plans with Jessica," I called over my shoulder as I strapped on my school bag, not 
meeting his eyes. "Maybe I won't be home for dinner. We'll go to Port Angeles and watch a 
movie." 

I was out the front door before he could react. 

In my haste to get away from Charlie, I ended up being one of the first ones to school. The 




plus side was that I got a really good parking spot. The downside was that I had free time on 
my hands, and I tried to avoid free time at all costs. 



Quickly, before I could start thinking about Charlie's accusations, I pulled out my Calculus 
book. I flipped it open to the section we should be starting today, and tried to make sense of 
it. Reading math was even worse than listening to it, but I was getting better at it. In the last 
several months, I'd spent ten times the amount of time on Calculus than I'd ever spent on 
math before. As a result, I was managing to keep in the range of a low A. I knew Mr. Varner 
felt my improvement was all due to his superior teaching methods. And if that made h im 
happy, I wasn't going to burst his bubble. 

I forced myself to keep at it until the parking lot was full, and I ended up rushing to English. 
We were working on Animal Farm , an easy subject matter. I didn't mind communism; it was 
a welcome change from the exhausting romances that made up most of the curriculum. I 
settled into my seat, pleased by the distraction of Mr. Berty's lecture. 

Time moved easily while I was in school. The bell rang all too soon. I started repacking my 
bag. 

"Bella?" 

I recognized Mike's voice, and I knew what his next words would be before he said them. 
"Are you working tomorrow?" 

I looked up. He was leaning across the aisle with an anxious expression. Every Friday he 
asked me the same question. Never mind that I hadn't taken so much as a sick day. Well, 
with one exception, months ago. But he had no reason to look at me with such concern. I 
was a model employee. 

"Tomorrow is Saturday, isn't it?" I said. Having just had it pointed out to me by Charlie, I 
realized how lifeless my voice really sounded. 

"Yeah, it is," he agreed. "See you in Spanish." He waved once before turning his back. He 
didn't bother walking me to class anymore. 

I trudged off to Calculus with a grim expression. This was the class where I sat next to 
Jessica. 

It had been weeks, maybe months, since Jess had even greeted me when I passed her in the 
hall. I knew I had offended her with my antisocial behavior, and she was sulking. It wasn't 
going to be easy to talk to her now-especially to ask her to do me a favor. I weighed my 
options carefully as I loitered outside the classroom, procrastinating. 

I wasn't about to face Charlie again without some kind of social interaction to report. I knew 
I couldn't lie, though the thought of driving to Port Angeles and back alone-being sure my 
odometer reflected the correct mileage, just in case he checked-was very tempting. Jessica's 




mom was the biggest gossip in town, and Charlie was bound to run into Mrs. Stanley sooner 
rather than later. When he did, he would no doubt mention the trip. Lying was out. 

With a sigh, I shoved the door open. 

Mr. Varner gave me a dark look-he'd already started the lecture. I hurried to my seat. Jessica 
didn't look up as I sat next to her. I was glad that I had fifty minutes to mentally prepare 
myself. 

This class flew by even faster than English. A small part of that speed was due to my 
goody-goody preparation this morning in the truck-but mostly it stemmed from the fact that 
time always sped up when I was looking forward to something unpleasant. 

I grimaced when Mr. Varner dismissed the class five minutes early. He smiled l ik e he was 
being nice. 

"Jess?" My nose wrinkled as I cringed, waiting for her to turn on me. 

She twisted in her seat to face me, eyeing me incredulously. "Are you talking to me, Bella?" 
"Of course." I widened my eyes to suggest innocence. 

"What? Do you need help with Calculus?" Her tone was a tad sour. 

"No." I shook my head. "Actually, I wanted to know if you would... go to the movies with 
me tonight? I really need a girls' night out." The words sounded stiff, l ik e badly delivered 
lines, and she looked suspicious. 

"Why are you asking me ?" she asked, still unfriendly. 

"You're the first person I think of when I want girl time." I smiled, and I hoped the smile 
looked genuine. It was probably true. She was at least the first person I thought of when I 
wanted to avoid Charlie. It amounted to the same thing. 

She seemed a little mollified. "Well, I don't know." 

"Do you have plans?" 

"No. . . I guess I can go with you. What do you want to see?" 

"I'm not sure what's playing," I hedged. This was the tricky part. I racked my brain for a 
clue-hadn't I heard someone talk about a movie recently? Seen a poster? "How about that 
one with the female president?" 

She looked at me oddly. "Bella, that one's been out of the theater forever." 



Oh." I frowned. "Is there anything you'd like to see?’ 




Jessica's natural bubbliness started to leak out in spite of herself as she thought out loud. 
"Well, there's that new romantic comedy that's getting great reviews. I want to see that one. 
And my dad just saw Dead End and he really l ik ed it." 

I grasped at the promising title. "What's that one about?" 

"Zombies or something. He said it was the scariest thing he'd seen in years." 

"That sounds perfect." I'd rather deal with real zombies than watch a romance. 

"Okay." She seemed surprised by my response. I tried to remember if I l ik ed scary movies, but 
I wasn't sure. "Do you want me to pick you up after school?" she offered. 

"Sure." 

Jessica smiled at me with tentative friendliness before she left. My answering smile was just a 
little late, but I thought that she saw it. 

The rest of the day passed quickly, my thoughts focused on planning for tonight. I knew from 
experience that once I got Jessica talking, I would be able to get away with a few mumbled 
responses at the appropriate moments. Only minimal interaction would be required. 

The thick haze that blurred my days now was sometimes confusing. I was surprised when I 
found myself in my room, not clearly remembering the drive home from school or even 
opening the front door. But that didn't matter. Losing track of time was the most I asked 
from life. 

I didn't fight the haze as I turned to my closet. The numbness was more essential in some 
places than in others. I barely registered what I was looking at as I slid the door aside to 
reveal the pile of rubbish on the left side of my closet, under the clothes I never wore. 

My eyes did not stray toward the black garbage bag that held my present from that last 
birthday, did not see the shape of the stereo where it strained against the black plastic; I 
didn't think of the bloody mess my nails had been when I'd finished clawing it out of the 
dashboard. 

I yanked the old purse I rarely used off the nail it hung from, and shoved the door shut. 

Just then I heard a horn honking. I swiftly traded my wallet from my schoolbag into the 
purse. I was in a hurry, as if rushing would somehow make the night pass more quickly. 

I glanced at myself in the hall mirror before I opened the door, arranging my features carefully 
into a smile and trying to hold them there. 

"Thanks for coming with me tonight," I told Jess as I climbed into the passenger seat, trying 
to infuse my tone with gratitude. It had been a while since I'd really thought about what I 
was saying to anyone besides Charlie. Jess was harder. I wasn't sure which were the right 




emotions to fake. 



"Sure. So, what brought this on?" Jess wondered as she drove down my street. 

"Brought what on?" 

"Why did you suddenly decide... to go out?" It sounded l ik e she changed her question 
halfway through. 

I shrugged. "Just needed a change." 

I recognized the song on the radio then, and quickly reached for the dial. "Do you mind?" I 
asked. 

"No, go ahead." 

I scanned through the stations until I found one that was harmless. I peeked at Jess's 
expression as the new music filled the car. 

Her eyes squinted. "Since when do you listen to rap?" 

"I don't know," I said. "A while." 

"You l ik e this?" she asked doubtfully. 

"Sure." 

It would be much too hard to interact with Jessica normally if I had to work to tune out the 
music, too. I nodded my head, hoping I was in time with the beat. 

"Okay. She stared out the windshield with wide eyes. 

"So what's up with you and Mike these days?" I asked quickly. 

"You see him more than I do." 

The question hadn't started her talking l ik e I'd hoped it would. 

"It's hard to talk at work," I mumbled, and then I tried again. "Have you been out with 
anyone lately?" 

"Not really. I go out with Conner sometimes. I went out with Eric two weeks ago." She 
rolled her eyes, and I sensed a long story. I clutched at the opportunity. 

"Eric Yorkiel Who asked who?" 

She groaned, getting more animated. "He did, of course! I couldn't think of a nice way to say 



no. 




'Where did he take you?" I demanded, knowing she would interpret my eagerness as interest. 
Tell me all about it." 



She launched into her tale, and I settled into my seat, more comfortable now. I paid strict 
attention, murmuring in sympathy and gasping in horror as called for. When she was finished 
with her Eric story, she continued into a Conner comparison without any prodding. 

The movie was playing early, so Jess thought we should hit the twilight showing and eat 
later. I was happy to go along with whatever she wanted; after all, I was getting what I 
wanted-Charlie off my back. 

I kept Jess talking through the previews, so I could ignore them more easily. But I got 
nervous when the movie started. A young couple was walking along a beach, swinging 
hands and discussing their mutual affection with gooey falseness. I resisted the urge to cover 
my ears and start humming. I had not bargained for a romance. 

"I thought we picked the zombie movie," I hissed to Jessica. 

"This is the zombie movie." 

"Then why isn't anyone getting eaten?" I asked desperately. 

She looked at me with wide eyes that were almost alarmed. "I'm sure that part's coming," she 
whispered. 

"I'm getting popcorn. Do you want any?" 

"No, thanks." 

Someone shushed us from behind. 

I took my time at the concession counter, watching the clock and debating what percentage 
of a ninety-minute movie could be spent on romantic exposition. I decided ten minutes was 
more than enough, but I paused just inside the theater doors to be sure. I could hear horrified 
screams blaring from the speakers, so I knew I'd waited long enough. 

"You missed everything," Jess murmured when I slid back into my seat. "Almost everyone is 
a zombie now." 

"Long line." I offered her some popcorn. She took a handful. 

The rest of the movie was comprised of gruesome zombie attacks and endless screaming 
from the handful of people left alive, their numbers dwindling quickly. I would have thought 
there was nothing in that to disturb me. But I felt uneasy, and I wasn't sure why at first. 

It wasn't until almost the very end, as I watched a haggard zombie shambling after the last 
shrieking survivor, that I realized what the problem was. The scene kept cutting between the 




horrified face of the heroine, and the dead, emotionless face of her pursuer, back and forth as 
it closed the distance. 

And I realized which one resembled me the most. 

I stood up. 

"Where are you going? There's, like, two minutes left," Jess hissed. 

"I need a drink," I muttered as I raced for the exit. 

I sat down on the bench outside the theater door and tried very hard not to think of the irony. 
But it was ironic, all things considered, that, in the end, I would wind up as a zombie. I 
hadn't seen that one coming. 

Not that I hadn't dreamed of becoming a mythical monster once-just never a grotesque, 
animated corpse. I shook my head to dislodge that train of thought, feeling panicky. I 
couldn't afford to think about what I'd once dreamed of. 

It was depressing to realize that I wasn't the heroine anymore, that my story was over. 

Jessica came out of the theater doors and hesitated, probably wondering where the best place 
was to search for me. When she saw me, she looked relieved, but only for a moment. Then 
she looked irritated. 

"Was the movie too scary for you?" she wondered. 

"Yeah," I agreed. "I guess I'm just a coward." 

"That's funny." She frowned. "I didn't think you were scared-I was screaming all the time, 
but I didn't hear you scream once. So I didn't know why you left." 

I shrugged. "Just scared." 

She relaxed a little. "That was the scariest movie I think I've ever seen. I'll bet we're going to 
have nightmares tonight." 

"No doubt about that," I said, trying to keep my voice normal. It was inevitable that I would 
have nightmares, but they wouldn't be about zombies. Her eyes flashed to my face and away. 
Maybe I hadn't succeeded with the normal voice. 

"Where do you want to eat?" Jess asked. 

"I don't care." 



"Okay." 

Jess started talking about the male lead in the movie as we walked. I nodded as she gushed 




over his hotness, unable to remember seeing a non- zombie man at all. 



I didn't watch where Jessica was leading me. I was only vaguely aware that it was dark and 
quieter now. It took me longer than it should have to realize why it was quiet. Jessica had 
stopped babbling. I looked at her apologetically, hoping I hadn't hurt her feelings. 

Jessica wasn't looking at me. Her face was tense; she stared straight ahead and walked fast. 
As I watched, her eyes darted quickly to the right, across the road, and back again. 

I glanced around myself for the first time. 

We were on a short stretch of unlit sidewalk. The little shops lining the street were all locked 
up for the night, windows black. Half a block ahead, the streetlights started up again, and I 
could see, farther down, the bright golden arches of the McDonald's she was heading for. 

Across the street there was one open business. The windows were covered from inside and 
there were neon signs, advertisements for different brands of beer, glowing in front of them. 
The biggest sign, in brilliant green, was the name of the bar-One-Eyed Pete's. I wondered if 
there was some pirate theme not visible from outside. The metal door was propped open; it 
was dimly lit inside, and the low murmur of many voices and the sound of ice clinking in 
glasses floated across the street. Lounging against the wall beside the door were four men. 

I glanced back at Jessica. Her eyes were fixed on the path ahead and she moved briskly. She 
didn't look frightened-just wary, trying to not attract attention to herself. 

I paused without thinking, looking back at the four men with a strong sense of deja vu. This 
was a different road, a different night, but the scene was so much the same. One of them was 
even short and dark. As I stopped and turned toward them, that one looked up in interest. 

I stared back at him, frozen on the sidewalk. 

"Bella?" Jess whispered. "What are you doing?" 

I shook my head, not sure myself. "I think I know them. . . " I muttered. 

What was I doing? I should be running from this memory as fast as I could, blocking the 
image of the four lounging men from my mind, protecting myself with the numbness I 
couldn't function without. Why was I stepping, dazed, into the street? 

It seemed too coincidental that I should be in Port Angeles with Jessica, on a dark street 
even. My eyes focused on the short one, trying to match the features to my memory of the 
man who had threatened me that night almost a year ago. I wondered if there was any way I 
would recognize the man, if it was really him. That particular part of that particular evening 
was just a blur. My body remembered it better than my mind did; the tension in my legs as I 
tried to decide whether to run or to stand my ground, the dryness in my throat as I struggled 
to build a decent scream, the tight stretch of skin across my knuckles as I clenched my hands 
into fists, the chills on the back of my neck when the dark- haired man called me "sugar.". . . 




There was an indefinite, implied kind of menace to these men that had nothing to do with 
that other night. It sprung from the fact that they were strangers, and it was dark here, and 
they outnumbered us-nothing more specific than that. But it was enough that Jessica's voice 
cracked in panic as she called after me. 

"Bella, come on!" 

I ignored her, walking slowly forward without ever making the conscious decision to move 
my feet. I didn't understand why, but the nebulous threat the men presented drew me toward 
them. It was a senseless impulse, but I hadn't felt any kind of impulse in so long. . . I followed 
it. 

Something unfamiliar beat through my veins. Adrenaline, I realized, long absent from my 
system, drumming my pulse faster and fighting against the lack of sensation. It was 
strange-why the adrenaline when there was no fear? It was almost as if it were an echo of 
the last time I'd stood l ik e this, on a dark street in Port Angeles with strangers. 

I saw no reason for fear. I couldn't imagine anything in the world that there was left to be 
afraid of, not physically at least. One of the few advantages of losing everything. 

I was halfway across the street when Jess caught up to me and grabbed my arm. 

"Bella! You can't go in a bar!" she hissed. 

"I'm not going in," I said absently, shaking her hand off. "I just want to see something. . ." 

"Are you crazy?" she whispered. "Are you suicidal?" 

That question caught my attention, and my eyes focused on her. 

"No, I'm not." My voice sounded defensive, but it was true. I wasn't suicidal. Even in the 
beginning, when death unquestionably would have been a relief, I didn't consider it. I owed 
too much to Charlie. I felt too responsible for Renee. I had to think of them. 

And I'd made a promise not to do anything stupid or reckless. For all those reasons, I was still 
breathing. 

Remembering that promise. I felt a twinge of guilt. 

but what I was doing fight now didn't really count. It wasn't l ik e I was taking a blade to my 
wrists. 

Jess's eyes were round, her mouth hung open. Her question about suicide had been rhetorical, 
I realized too late. 



"Go eat," I encouraged her, waving toward the fast food. I didn't like the way she looked at 
me. "I'll catch up in a minute." 




I turned away from her, back to the men who were watching us with amused, curious eyes. 
"Bella, stop this right now!" 

My muscles locked into place, froze me where I stood. Because it wasn't Jessica's voice that 
rebuked me now. It was a furious voice, a familiar voice, a beautiful voice-soft like velvet 
even though it was irate. 

It was his voice-I was exceptionally careful not to think his name-and I was surprised that 
the sound of it did not knock me to my knees, did not curl me onto the pavement in a torture 
of loss. But there was no pain, none at all. 

In the instant that I heard his voice, everything was very clear. Like my head had suddenly 
surfaced out of some dark pool. I was more aware of everything-sight, sound, the feel of the 
cold air that I hadn't noticed was blowing sharply against my face, the smells coming from 
the open bar door. 

I looked around myself in shock. 

"Go back to Jessica," the lovely voice ordered, still angry. "You promised-nothing stupid." 

I was alone. Jessica stood a few feet from me, staring at me with frightened eyes. Against the 
wall, the strangers watched, confused, wondering what I was doing, standing there 
motionless in the middle of the street. 

I shook my head, trying to understand. I knew he wasn't there, and yet, he felt improbably 
close, close for the first time since... since the end. The anger in his voice was concern, the 
same anger that was once very familiar-something I hadn't heard in what felt l ik e a lifetime. 

"Keep your promise." The voice was slipping away, as if the volume was being turned down 
on a radio. 

I began to suspect that I was having some kind of hallucination. Triggered, no doubt, by the 
memory-the deja vu, the strange familiarity of the situation. 

I ran through the possibilities quickly in my head. 

Option one: I was crazy. That was the layman's term for people who heard voices in their 
heads. 

Possible. 

Option two: My subconscious mind was giving me what it thought I wanted. This was wish 
fulfillment-a momentary relief from pain by embracing the incorrect idea that he cared 
whether I lived or died. Projecting what he would have said if A) he were here, and B) he 
would be in any way bothered by something bad happening to me. 




Probable. 



I could see no option three, so I hoped it was the second option and this was just my 
subconscious running amuck, rather than something I would need to be hospitalized for. 

My reaction was hardly sane, though-I was grateful. The sound of his voice was something 
that I'd feared I was losing, and so, more than anything else, I felt overwhelming gratitude 
that my unconscious mind had held onto that sound better than my conscious one had. 

I was not allowed to think of him. That was something I tried to be very strict about. Of 
course I slipped; I was only human. But I was getting better, and so the pain was something I 
could avoid for days at a time now. The tradeoff was the never-ending numbness. Between 
pain and nothing, I'd chosen nothing. 

I waited for the pain now. I was not numb-my senses felt unusually intense after so many 
months of the haze-but the normal pain held off. The only ache was the disappointment that 
his voice was fading. 

There was a second of choice. 

The wise thing would be to run away from this potentially destructive-and certainly mentally 
unstable-development. It would be stupid to encourage hallucinations. 

But his voice was fading. 

I took another step forward, testing. 

"Bella, turn around," he growled. 

I sighed in relief. The anger was what I wanted to hear-false, fabricated evidence that he 
cared, a dubious gift from my subconscious. 

Very few seconds had passed while I sorted this all out. My little audience watched, curious. 
It probably looked like I was just dithering over whether or not I was going to approach 
them. How could they guess that I was standing there enjoying an unexpected moment of 
insanity? 

"Hi," one of the men called, his tone both confident and a bit sarcastic. He was fair-s ki nned 
and fair-haired, and he stood with the assurance of someone who thought of himself as quite 
good-looking. I couldn't tell whether he was or not. I was prejudiced. 

The voice in my head answered with an exquisite snarl. I smiled, and the confident man 
seemed to take that as encouragement. 

"Can I help you with something? You look lost." He grinned and winked. 

I stepped carefully over the gutter, running with water that was black in the darkness. 




No. I'm not lost. 



Now that I was closer-and my eyes felt oddly in focus-I analyzed the short, dark man's face. 
It was not fa mil iar in any way. I suffered a curious sensation of disappointment that this was 
not the terrible man who had tried to hurt me almost a year ago. 

The voice in my head was quiet now. 

The short man noticed my stare. "Can I buy you a drink?" he offered, nervous, seeming 
flattered that I'd singled him out to stare at. 

"I'm too young," I answered automatically. 

He was baffled-wondering why I had approached them. I felt compelled to explain. 

"From across the street, you looked l ik e someone I knew. Sorry, my mistake." 

The threat that had pulled me across the street had evaporated. These were not the 
dangerous men I remembered. They were probably nice guys. Safe. I lost interest. 

"That's okay," the confident blonde said. "Stay and hang out with us." 

"Thanks, but I can't." Jessica was hesitating in the middle of the street, her eyes wide with 
outrage and betrayal. 

"Oh, just a few minutes." 

I shook my head, and turned to rejoin Jessica. 

"Let's go eat," I suggested, barely glancing at her. Though I appeared to be, for the moment, 
freed of the zombie abstraction, I was just as distant. My mind was preoccupied. The safe, 
numb deadness did not come back, and I got more anxious with every minute that passed 
without its return. 

"What were you thinking?" Jessica snapped. "You don't know them-they could have been 
psychopaths!" 

I shrugged, wishing she would let it go. "I just thought I knew the one guy." 

"You are so odd, Bella Swan. I feel l ik e I don't know who you are." 

"Sorry." I didn't know what else to say to that. 

We walked to McDonald's in silence. I'd bet that she was wishing we'd taken her car instead 
of walking the short distance from the theater, so that she could use the drive-through. She 
was just as anxious now for this evening to be over as I had been from the beginning. 

I tried to start a conversation a few times while we ate, but Jessica was not cooperative. I 




must have really offended her. 



When we go back in the car, she tuned the stereo back to her favorite station and turned the 
volume too loud to allow easy conversation. 

I didn't have to struggle as hard as usual to ignore the music. Even though my mind, for 
once, was not carefully numb and empty, I had too much to think about to hear the lyrics. 

I waited for the numbness to return, or the pain. Because the pain must be coming. I'd 
broken my personal rules. Instead of shying away from the memories, I'd walked forward and 
greeted them. I'd heard his voice, so clearly, in my head. That was going to cost me, I was 
sure of it. Especially if I couldn't reclaim the haze to protect myself. I felt too alert, and that 
frightened me. 

But relief was still the strongest emotion in my body-relief that came from the very core of 
my being. 

As much as I struggled not to think of him, I did not struggle to forget. I worried-late in the 
night, when the exhaustion of sleep deprivation broke down my defenses-that it was all 
slipping away. That my mind was a sieve, and I would someday not be able to remember the 
precise color of his eyes, the feel of his cool skin, or the texture of his voice. I could not think 
of them, but I must remember them. 

Because there was just one thing that I had to believe to be able to live-I had to know that 
he existed. That was all. Everything else I could endure. So long as he existed. 

That's why I was more trapped in Forks than I ever had been before, why I'd fought with 
Charlie when he suggested a change. Honestly, it shouldn't matter; no one was ever coming 
back here. 

But if I were to go to Jacksonville, or anywhere else bright and unfamiliar, how could I be 
sure he was real? In a place where I could never imagine him, the conviction might fade... 
and that I could not live through. 

Forbidden to remember, terrified to forget; it was a hard line to walk. 

I was surprised when Jessica stopped the car in front of my house. The ride had not taken 
long, but, short as it seemed, I wouldn't have thought that Jessica could go that long without 
speaking. 

"Thanks for going out with me, Jess," I said as I opened my door. "That was... fun." I hoped 
that fun was the appropriate word. 

"Sure," she muttered. 

"I'm sorry about. . . after the movie." 




"Whatever, Bella." She glared out the windshield instead of looking at me. She seemed to be 
growing angrier rather than getting over it. 

"See you Monday?" 

"Yeah. Bye." 

I gave up and shut the door. She drove away, still without looking at me. 

I'd forgotten her by the time I was inside. 

Charlie was waiting for me in the middle of the hall, his arms folded tight over his chest with 
his hands balled into fists. 

"Hey, Dad," I said absentmindedly as I ducked around Charlie, heading for the stairs. I'd been 
thinking about him for too long, and I wanted to be upstairs before it caught up with me. 

"Where have you been?" Charlie demanded. 

I looked at my dad, surprised. "I went to a movie in Port Angeles with Jessica. Like I told 
you this morning." 

"Humph," he grunted. 

"Is that okay?" 

He studied my face, his eyes widening as if he saw something unexpected. "Yeah, that's fine. 
Did you have fun?" 

"Sure," I said. "We watched zombies eat people. It was great." 

His eyes narrowed. 

"'Night, Dad." 

He let me pass. I hurried to my room. 

I lay in my bed a few minutes later, resigned as the pain finally made its appearance. 

It was a crippling thing, this sensation that a huge hole had been punched through my chest, 
excising my most vital organs and leaving ragged, unhealed gashes around the edges that 
continued to throb and bleed despite the passage of time. Rationally, I knew my lungs must 
still be intact, yet I gasped for air and my head spun like my efforts yielded me nothing. My 
heart must have been beating, too, but I couldn't hear the sound of my pulse in my ears; my 
hands felt blue with cold. I curled inward, hugging my ribs to hold myself together. I 
scrambled for my numbness, my denial, but it evaded me. 

And yet, I found I could survive. I was alert, I felt the pain-the aching loss that radiated out 




from my chest, sending wracking waves of hurt through my limbs and head-but it was 
manageable. I could live through it. It didn't feel like the pain had weakened over time, rather 
that I'd grown strong enough to bear it. 

Whatever it was that had happened tonight-and whether it was the zombies, the adrenaline, 
or the hallucinations that were responsible-it had woken me up. 

For the first time in a long time, I didn't know what to expect in the morning. 




5. CHEATER 



"BELLA, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OLE," MIKE SUGGESTED, his eyes focused off to 
the side, not really looking at me. I wondered how long that had been going on without me 
noticing. 

It was a slow afternoon at Newton's. At the moment there were only two patrons in the 
store, dedicated backpackers from the sound of their conversation. Mike had spent the last 
hour going through the pros and cons of two brands of lightweight packs with them. But 
they'd taken a break from serious pricing to indulge in trying to one-up each other with their 
latest tales from the trail. Their distraction had given Mike a chance to escape. 

"I don't mind staying," I said. I still hadn't been able to sink back into my protective shell of 
numbness, and everything seemed oddly close and loud today, l ik e I'd taken cotton out of my 
ears. I tried to tune out the laughing h ik ers without success. 

"I'm telling you," said the thickset man with the orange beard that didn't match his dark 
brown hair. "I've seen grizzlies pretty close up in Yellowstone, but they had nothing on this 
brute." His hair was matted, and his clothes looked like they'd been on his back for more than 
a few days. Fresh from the mountains. 

"Not a chance. Black bears don't get that big. The grizzlies you saw were probably cubs." 
The second man was tall and lean, his face tanned and wind-whipped into an impressive 
leathery crust. 

"Seriously, Bella, as soon as these two give up, I'm closing the place down," Mike murmured. 
"If you want me to go. . . " I shrugged. 

"On all fours it was taller than you," the bearded man insisted while I gathered my things 
together. "Big as a house and pitch-black. I'm going to report it to the ranger here. People 
ought to be warned-this wasn't up on the mountain, mind you-this was only a few miles 
from the trailhead." 

Leather-face laughed and rolled his eyes. "Let me guess-you were on your way in? Hadn't 
eaten real food or slept off the ground in a week, right?" 

"Hey, uh, Mike, right?" the bearded man called, looking toward us. 

"See you Monday," I mumbled. 

"Yes, sir," Mike replied, turning away. 

"Say, have there been any warnings around here recently-about black bears?" 

"No, sir. But it's always good to keep your distance and store your food correctly. Have you 
seen the new bear-safe canisters? They only weigh two pounds. . . " 




The doors slid open to let me out into the rain. I hunched over inside my jacket as I dashed 
for my truck. The rain hammering against my hood sounded unusually loud, too, but soon the 
roar of the engine drowned out everything else. 

I didn't want to go back to Charlie's empty house. Last night had been particularly brutal, 
and I had no desire to revisit the scene of the suffering. Even after the pain had subsided 
enough for me to sleep, it wasn't over. Like I'd told Jessica after the movie, there was never 
any doubt that I would have nightmares. 

I always had nightmares now, every night. Not nightmares really, not in the plural, because it 
was always the same nightmare. You'd think I'd get bored after so many months, grow 
immune to it. But the dream never failed to horrify me, and only ended when I woke myself 
with screaming. Charlie didn't come in to see what was wrong anymore, to make sure there 
was no intruder strangling me or something l ik e that-he was used to it now. 

My nightmare probably wouldn't even frighten someone else. Nothing jumped out and 
screamed, "Boo!" There were no zombies, no ghosts, no psychopaths. There was nothing, 
really. Only nothing. Just the endless maze of moss-covered trees, so quiet that the silence 
was an uncomfortable pressure against my eardrums. It was dark, like dusk on a cloudy day, 
with only enough light to see that there was nothing to see. I hurried through the gloom 
without a path, always searching, searching, searching, getting more frantic as the time 
stretched on, trying to move faster, though the speed made me clumsy... Then there would 
come the point in my dream-and I could feel it coming now, but could never seem to wake 
myself up before it hit-when I couldn't remember what it was that I was searching for. When 
I realized that there was nothing to search for, and nothing to find. That there never had been 
anything more than just this empty, dreary wood, and there never would be anything more 
for me. . . nothing but nothing. . . 

That was usually about when the screaming started. 

I wasn't paying attention to where I was driving-just wandering through empty, wet side 
roads as I avoided the ways that would take me home-because I didn't have anywhere to go. 

I wished I could feel numb again, but I couldn't remember how I'd managed it before. The 
nightmare was nagging at my mind and making me think about things that would cause me 
pain. I didn't want to remember the forest. Even as I shuddered away from the images, I felt 
my eyes fill with tears and the aching begin around the edges of the hole in my chest. I took 
one hand from the steering wheel and wrapped it around my torso to hold it in one piece. 

It will be as if I'd never existed. The words ran through my head, lacking the perfect clarity of 
my hallucination last night. They were just words, soundless, like print on a page. Just words, 
but they ripped the hole wide open, and I stomped on the brake, knowing I should not drive 
while this incapacitated. 



I curled over, pressing my face against the steering wheel and trying to breathe without 




lungs. 



I wondered how long this could last. Maybe someday, years from now-if the pain would just 
decrease to the point where I could bear it-I would be able to look back on those few short 
months that would always be the best of my life. And, if it were possible that the pain would 
ever soften enough to allow me to do that, I was sure that I would feel grateful for as much 
time as he'd given me. More than I'd asked for, more than I'd deserved. Maybe someday I'd 
be able to see it that way. 

But what if this hole never got any better? If the raw edges never healed? If the damage was 
permanent and irreversible? 

I held myself tightly together. As if he'd never existed , I thought in despair. What a stupid 
and impossible promise to make! He could steal my pictures and reclaim his gifts, but that 
didn't put things back the way they'd been before I'd met him. The physical evidence was the 
most insignificant part of the equation. 1 was changed, my insides altered almost past the 
point of recognition. Even my outsides looked different-my face sallow, white except for the 
purple circles the nightmares had left under my eyes. My eyes were dark enough against my 
pallid skin that-if I were beautiful, and seen from a distance-I might even pass for a vampire 
now. But I was not beautiful, and I probably looked closer to a zombie. 

As if he'd never existed? That was insanity. It was a promise that he could never keep, a 
promise that was broken as soon as he'd made it. 

I thumped my head against the steering wheel, trying to distract myself from the sharper pain. 

It made me feel silly for ever worrying about keeping my promise. Where was the logic in 
sticking to an agreement that had already been violated by the other party? Who cared if I 
was reckless and stupid? There was no reason to avoid recklessness, no reason why I 
shouldn't get to be stupid. 

I laughed humorlessly to myself, still gasping for air. Reckless in Forks-now there was a 
hopeless proposition. 

The dark humor distracted me, and the distraction eased the pain. My breath came easier, and 
I was able to lean back against the seat. Though it was cold today, my forehead was damp 
with sweat. 

I concentrated on my hopeless proposition to keep from sliding back into the excruciating 
memories. To be reckless in Forks would take a lot of creativity-maybe more than I had. But 
I wished I could find some way... I might feel better if I weren't holding fast, all alone, to a 
broken pact. If I were an oath-breaker, too. But how could I cheat on my side of the deal, 
here in this harmless little town? Of course, Forks hadn't always been so harmless, but now it 
was exactly what it had always appeared to be. It was dull, it was safe. 

I stared out the windshield for a long moment, my thoughts moving sluggishly-I couldn't 




seem to make those thoughts go anywhere. I cut the engine, which was groaning in a pitiful 
way after idling for so long, and stepped out into the drizzle. 

The cold rain dripped through my hair and then trickled across my cheeks l ik e freshwater 
tears. It helped to clear my head. I blinked the water from my eyes, staring blankly across the 
road. 

After a minute of staring, I recognized where I was. I'd parked in the middle of the north lane 
of Russell Avenue. I was standing in front of the Cheneys' house-my truck was blocking 
their driveway-and across the road lived the Markses. I knew I needed to move my truck, 
and that I ought to go home. It was wrong to wander the way I had, distracted and impaired, 
a menace on the roads of Forks. Besides, someone would notice me soon enough, and report 
me to Charlie. 

As I took a deep breath in preparation to move, a sign in the Markses' yard caught my eye-it 
was just a big piece of cardboard leaning against their mailbox post, with black letters 
scrawled in caps across it. 

Sometimes, kismet happens. 

Coincidence? Or was it meant to be? I didn't know, but it seemed kind of silly to think that it 
was somehow fated, that the dilapidated motorcycles rusting in the Markses' front yard 
beside the hand-printed FOR SALE, AS IS sign were serving some higher purpose by 
existing there, right where I needed them to be. 

So maybe it wasn't kismet. Maybe there were just all kinds of ways to be reckless, and I only 
now had my eyes open to them. 

Reckless and stupid. Those were Charlie's two very favorite words to apply to motorcycles. 

Charlie's job didn't get a lot of action compared to cops in bigger towns, but he did get called 
in on traffic accidents. With the long, wet stretches of freeway twisting and turning through 
the forest, blind corner after blind comer, there was no shortage of that kind of action. But 
even with all the huge log-haulers barreling around the turns, mostly people walked away. 
The exceptions to that rule were often on motorcycles, and Charlie had seen one too many 
victims, almost always kids, smeared on the highway. He'd made me promise before I was 
ten that I would never accept a ride on a motorcycle. Even at that age, I didn't have to think 
twice before promising. Who would want to ride a motorcycle here! It would be l ik e taking 
a sixty-mile-per-hour bath. 

So many promises I kept. . . 

It clicked together for me then. I wanted to be stupid and reckless, and I wanted to break 
promises. Why stop at one? 



That's as far as I thought it through. I sloshed through the rain to the Markses' front door and 




rang the bell. 

One of the Marks boys opened the door, the younger one, the freshman. I couldn't remember 
his name. His sandy hair only came up to my shoulder. 

He had no trouble remembering my name. "Bella Swan?" he asked in surprise. 

"How much do you want for the bike?" I panted, jerking my thumb over my shoulder toward 
the sales display. 

"Are you serious?" he demanded. 

"Of course I am." 

"They don't work." 

I sighed impatiently-this was something I'd already inferred from the sign. "How much?" 

"If you really want one, just take it. My mom made my dad move them down to the road so 
they'd get picked up with the garbage." 

I glanced at the bikes again and saw that they were resting on a pile of yard clippings and 
dead branches. "Are you positive about that?" 

"Sure, you want to ask her?" 

It was probably better not to involve adults who might mention this to Charlie. 

"No, I believe you." 

"You want me to help you?" he offered. "They're not light." 

"Okay, thanks. I only need one, though." 

"Might as well take both," the boy said. "Maybe you could scavenge some parts." 

He followed me out into the downpour and helped me load both of the heavy bikes into the 
back of my truck. He seemed eager to be rid of them, so I didn't argue. 

"What are you going to do with them, anyway?" he asked. "They haven't worked in years." 

"I kind of guessed that," I said, shrugging. My spur-of-the-moment whim hadn't come with a 
plan intact. "Maybe I'll take them to Dowling's." 

He snorted. "Dowling would charge more to fix them than they'd be worth running." 

I couldn't argue with that. John Dowling had earned a reputation for his pricing; no one went 
to him except in an emergency. Most people preferred to make the drive up to Port Angeles, 
if their car was able. I'd been very lucky on that front-I'd been worried, when Charlie first 




gifted me my ancient truck, that I wouldn't be able to afford to keep it running. But I'd never 
had a single problem with it, other than the screaming-loud engine and the 
fifty-five-mile -per-hour maximum speed limit. Jacob Black had kept it in great shape when it 
had belonged to his father, Billy. . . 

Inspiration hit l ik e a bolt of lightning-not unreasonable, considering the storm. "You know 
what? That's okay. I know someone who builds cars." 

"Oh. That's good." He smiled in relief. 

He waved as I pulled away, still smiling. Friendly kid. 

I drove quickly and purposefully now, in a hurry to get home before there was the slightest 
chance of Charlie appearing, even in the highly unlikely event that he might knock off early. I 
dashed through the house to the phone, keys still in hand. 

"Chief Swan, please," I said when the deputy answered. "It's Bella." 

"Oh, hey, Bella," Deputy Steve said affably. "I'll go get him." 

I waited. 

"What's wrong, Bella?" Charlie demanded as soon as he picked up the phone. 

"Can't I call you at work without there being an emergency?" 

He was quiet for a minute. "You never have before. Is there an emergency?" 

"No. I just wanted directions to the Blacks' place-I'm not sure I can remember the way. I 
want to visit Jacob. I haven't seen him in months." 

When Charlie spoke again, his voice was much happier. "That's a great idea, Bells. Do you 
have a pen?" 

The directions he gave me were very simple. I assured him that I would be back for dinner, 
though he tried to tell me not to hurry. He wanted to join me in La Push, and I wasn't having 
that. 

So it was with a deadline that I drove too quickly through the storm-darkened streets out of 
town. I hoped I could get Jacob alone. Billy would probably tell on me if he knew what I was 
up to. 

While I drove, I worried a little bit about Billy's reaction to seeing me. He would be too 
pleased. In Billy's mind, no doubt, this had all worked out better than he had dared to hope. 
His pleasure and relief would only remind me of the one I couldn't bear to be reminded of. 
Not again today, I pleaded silently. I was spent. 

The Blacks' house was vaguely familiar, a small wooden place with narrow windows, the 




dull red paint making it resemble a tiny bam. Jacob's head peered out of the window before I 
could even get out of the truck. No doubt the familiar roar of the engine had tipped him off 
to my approach. Jacob had been very grateful when Charlie bought Billy's truck for me, 
saving Jacob from having to drive it when he came of age. I liked my truck very much, but 
Jacob seemed to consider the speed restrictions a shortcoming. 

He met me halfway to the house. 

"Bella!" His excited grin stretched wide across his face, the bright teeth standing in vivid 
contrast to the deep russet color of his skin. I'd never seen his hair out of its usual ponytail 
before. It fell l ik e black satin curtains on either side of his broad face. 

Jacob had grown into some of his potential in the last eight months. He'd passed that point 
where the soft muscles of childhood hardened into the solid, lanky build of a teenager; the 
tendons and veins had become prominent under the red-brown skin of his arms, his hands. 
His face was still sweet l ik e I remembered it, though it had hardened, too-the planes of his 
cheekbones sharper, his jaw squared off, all childish roundness gone. 

"Hey, Jacob!" I felt an unfamiliar surge of enthusiasm at his smile. I realized that I was 
pleased to see him. This knowledge surprised me. 

I smiled back, and something clicked silently into place, like two corresponding puzzle 
pieces. I'd forgotten how much I really l ik ed Jacob Black. 

He stopped a few feet away from me, and I stared up at him in surprise, leaning my head 
back though the rain pelted my face. 

"You grew again!" I accused in amazement. 

He laughed, his smile widening impossibly. "Six five," he announced with self-satisfaction. 
His voice was deeper, but it had the husky tone I remembered. 

"Is it ever going to stop?" I shook my head in disbelief. "You're huge." 

"Still a beanpole, though." He grimaced. "Come inside! You're getting all wet." 

He led the way, twisting his hair in his big hands as he walked. He pulled a rubber band from 
his hip pocket and wound it around the bundle. 

"Hey, Dad," he called as he ducked to get through the front door. "Look who stopped by." 

Billy was in the tiny square living room, a book in his hands. He set the book in his lap and 
wheeled himself forward when he saw me. 

"Well, what do you know! It's good to see you, Bella." 

We shook hands. Mine was lost in his wide grasp. 




"What brings you out here? Everything okay with Charlie?" 

"Yes, absolutely. I just wanted to see Jacob-I haven't seen him in forever." 

Jacob's eyes brightened at my words. He was smiling so big it looked like it would hurt his 
cheeks. 

"Can you stay for dinner?" Billy was eager, too. 

"No, I've got to feed Charlie, you know." 

"I'll call him now," Billy suggested. "He's always invited." 

I laughed to hide my discomfort. "It's not l ik e you'll never see me again. I promise I'll be back 
again soon-so much you'll get sick of me." After all, if Jacob could fix the bike, someone had 
to teach me how to ride it. 

Billy chuckled in response. "Okay, maybe next time." 

"So, Bella, what do you want to do?" Jacob asked. 

"Whatever. What were you doing before I interrupted?" I was strangely comfortable here. It 
was familiar, but only distantly. There were no painful reminders of the recent past. 

Jacob hesitated. "I was just heading out to work on my car, but we can do something else. . ." 

"No, that's perfect!" I interrupted. "I'd love to see your car." 

"Okay," he said, not convinced. "It's out back, in the garage." 

Even better , I thought to myself. I waved at Billy. "See you later." 

A thick stand of trees and shrubbery concealed his garage from the house. The garage was no 
more than a couple of big preformed sheds that had been bolted together with their interior 
walls knocked out. Under this shelter, raised on cinder blocks, was what looked to me like a 
completed automobile. I recognized the symbol on the grille, at least. 

"What kind of Volkswagen is that?" I asked. 

"It's an old Rabbit-1986, a classic." 

"How's it going?" 

"Almost finished," he said cheerfully. And then his voice dropped into a lower key. "My dad 
made good on his promise last spring." 



’Ah," I said. 




He seemed to understand my reluctance to open the subject. I tried not to remember last May 
at the prom. Jacob had been bribed by his father with money and car parts to deliver a 
message there. Billy wanted me to stay a safe distance from the most important person in my 
life. It turned out that his concern was, in the end, unnecessary. I was all too safe now. 

But I was going to see what I could do to change that. 

"Jacob, what do you know about motorcycles?" I asked. 

He shrugged. "Some. My friend Embry has a dirt bike. We work on it together sometimes. 
Why?" 

"Well. . ." I pursed my lips as I considered. I wasn't sure if he could keep his mouth shut, but I 
didn't have many other options. "I recently acquired a couple of bikes, and they're not in the 
greatest condition. I wonder if you could get them running?" 

"Cool." He seemed truly pleased by the challenge. His face glowed. "I'll give it a try." 

I held up one finger in warning. "The thing is," I explained, "Charlie doesn't approve of 
motorcycles. Honestly, he'd probably bust a vein in his forehead if he knew about this. So 
you can't tell Billy." 

"Sure, sure." Jacob smiled. "I understand." 

"I'll pay you," I continued. 

This offended him. "No. I want to help. You can't pay me." 

"Well. . . how about a trade, then?" I was making this up as I went, but it seemed reasonable 
enough. "I only need one bike-and I'll need lessons, too. So how about this? I'll give you the 
other bike, and then you can teach me." 

"Swee-eet." He made the word into two syllables. 

"Wait a sec-are you legal yet? When's your birthday?" 

"You missed it," he teased, narrowing his eyes in mock resentment. "I'm sixteen." 

"Not that your age ever stopped you before," I muttered. "Sorry about your birthday." 

"Don't worry about it. I missed yours. What are you, forty?" 

I sniffed. "Close." 

"We'll have a joint party to make up for it." 



Sounds like a date. 




His eyes sparkled at the word. 



I needed to reign in the enthusiasm before I gave him the wrong idea-it was just that it had 
been a long time since I'd felt so light and buoyant. The rarity of the feeling made it more 
difficult to manage. 

"Maybe when the bikes are finished-our present to ourselves," I added. 

"Deal. When will you bring them down?" 

I bit my lip, embarrassed. "They're in my truck now," I admitted. 

"Great." He seemed to mean it. 

"Will Billy see if we bring them around?" 

He winked at me. "We'll be sneaky." 

We eased around from the east, sticking to the trees when we were in view of the windows, 
affecting a casual-looking stroll, just in case. Jacob unloaded the bikes swiftly from the truck 
bed, wheeling them one by one into the shrubbery where I hid. It looked too easy for him-I'd 
remembered the bikes being much, much heavier than that. 

"These aren't half bad," Jacob appraised as we pushed them through the cover of the trees. 
"This one here will actually be worth something when I'm done-it's an old Hailey Sprint." 

"That one's yours, then." 

"Are you sure?" 

"Absolutely." 

"These are going to take some cash, though," he said, frowning down at the blackened metal. 
"We'll have to save up for parts first." 

"We nothing," I disagreed. "If you're doing this for free, I'll pay for the parts." 

"I don't know. . . " he muttered. 

"I've got some money saved. College fund, you know." College, schmollege, I thought to 
myself. It wasn't like I'd saved up enough to go anywhere special-and besides, I had no 
desire to leave Forks anyway. What difference would it make if I s ki mmed a little bit off the 
top? 

Jacob just nodded. This all made perfect sense to him. 

As we skulked back to the makeshift garage, I contemplated my luck. Only a teenage boy 
would agree to this: deceiving both our parents while repairing dangerous vehicles using 




money meant for my college education. He didn't see anything wrong with that picture. 
Jacob was a gift from the gods. 




6. FRIENDS 



THE MOTORCYCLES DIDN'T NEED TO BE HIDDEN ANY further than simply 
placing them in Jacob's shed. Billy's wheelchair couldn't maneuver the uneven ground 
separating it from the house. 

Jacob started pulling the first bike-the red one, which was destined for me-to pieces 
immediately. He opened up the passenger door of the Rabbit so I could sit on the seat instead 
of the ground. While he worked, Jacob chattered happily, needing only the lightest of nudges 
from me to keep the conversation rolling. He updated me on the progress of his sophomore 
year of school, running on about his classes and his two best friends. 

"Quil and Embry?" I interrupted. "Those are unusual names." 

Jacob chuckled. "Quil's is a hand-me-down, and I think Embry got named after a soap opera 
star. I can't say anything, though. They fight dirty if you start on their names-they'll tag team 
you." 

"Good friends." I raised one eyebrow. 

"No, they are. Just don't mess with their names." 

Just then a call echoed in the distance. "Jacob?" someone shouted. 

"Is that Billy?" I asked. 

"No." Jacob ducked his head, and it looked l ik e he was blushing under his brown s ki n. 
"Speak of the devil," he mumbled, "and the devil shall appear." 

"Jake? Are you out here?" The shouting voice was closer now. 

"Yeah!" Jacob shouted back, and sighed. 

We waited through the short silence until two tall, dark-skinned boys strolled around the 
comer into the shed. 

One was slender, and almost as tall as Jacob. His black hair was chin-length and parted down 
the middle, one side tucked behind his left ear while the right side swung free. The shorter 
boy was more burly. His white T-shirt strained over his well-developed chest, and he seemed 
gleefully conscious of that fact. His hair was so short it was almost a buzz. 

Both boys stopped short when they saw me. The thin boy glanced swiftly back and forth 
between Jacob and me, while the brawny boy kept his eyes on me, a slow smile spreading 
across his face. 

"Hey, guys," Jacob greeted them halfheartedly. 




"Hey, Jake," the short one said without looking away from me. I had to smile in response, his 
grin was so impish. When I did, he winked at me. "Hi, there." 

"Quil, Embry-this is my friend, Bella." 

Quil and Embry, I still didn't know which was which, exchanged a loaded look. 

"Charlie's kid, right?" the brawny boy asked me, holding out his hand. 

"That's right," I confirmed, shaking hands with him. His grasp was firm; it looked like he was 
flexing his bicep. 

"I'm Quil Ateara," he announced grandly before releasing my hand. 

"Nice to meet you, Quil." 

"Hey, Bella. I'm Embry, Embry Call-you probably already figured that out, though." Embry 
smiled a shy smile and waved with one hand, which he then shoved in the pocket of his 
jeans. 

I nodded. "Nice to meet you, too." 

"So what are you guys doing?" Quil asked, still looking at me. 

"Bella and I are going to fix up these bikes," Jacob explained inaccurately. But bikes seemed 
to be the magic word. Both boys went to examine Jacob's project, drilling him with educated 
questions. Many of the words they used were unfamiliar to me, and I figured I'd have to have 
a Y chromosome to really understand the excitement. 

They were still immersed in talk of parts and pieces when I decided that I needed to head 
back home before Charlie showed up here. With a sigh, I slid out of the Rabbit. 

Jacob looked up, apologetic. "We're boring you, aren't we?" 

"Naw." And it wasn't a lie. I was enjoying myself-how strange. "I just have to go cook 
dinner for Charlie." 

"Oh... well, I'll finish taking these apart tonight and figure out what more we'll need to get 
started rebuilding them. When do you want to work on them again?" 

"Could I come back tomorrow?" Sundays were the bane of my existence. There was never 
enough homework to keep me busy. 

Quil nudged Embry's arm and they exchanged grins. 

Jacob smiled in delight. "That would be great!" 

"If you make a list, we can go shop for parts," I suggested. 




Jacob's face fell a little. "I'm still not sure I should let you pay for everything." 

I shook my head. "No way. I'm bankrolling this party. You just have to supply the labor and 
expertise." 

Embry rolled his eyes at Quil. 

"That doesn't seem right," Jacob shook his head. 

"Jake, if I took these to a mechanic, how much would he charge me?" I pointed out. 

He smiled. "Okay, you're getting a deal." 

"Not to mention the riding lessons," I added. 

Quil grinned widely at Embry and whispered something I didn't catch. Jacob's hand flashed 
out to smack the back of Quit's head. "That's it, get out," he muttered. 

"No, really, I have to go," I protested, heading for the door. "I'll see you tomorrow, Jacob." 

As soon as I was out of sight, I heard Quil and Embry chorus, "Wooooo!" 

The sound of a brief scuffle followed, interspersed with an "ouch" and a "hey!" 

"If either of you set so much as one toe on my land tomorrow. . . " I heard Jacob threaten. His 
voice was lost as I walked through the trees. 

I giggled quietly. The sound made my eyes widen in wonder. I was laughing, actually 
laughing, and there wasn't even anyone watching. I felt so weightless that I laughed again, 
just make the feeling last longer. 

I beat Charlie home. When he walked in I was just taking the fried chicken out of the pan 
and laying it on a pile of paper towels. 

"Hey, Dad." I flashed him a grin. 

Shock flitted across his face before he pulled his expression together. "Hey, honey," he said, 
his voice uncertain. "Did you have fun with Jacob?" 

I started moving the food to the table. "Yeah, I did." 

"Well, that's good." He was still cautious. "What did you two do?" 

Now it was my turn to be cautious. "I hung out in his garage and watched him work. Did 
you know he's rebuilding a Volkswagen?" 



Yeah, I think Billy mentioned that. 




The interrogation had to stop when Charlie began chewing, but he continued to study my 
face as he ate. 

After dinner, I dithered around, cleaning the kitchen twice, and then did my homework 
slowly in the front room while Charlie watched a hockey game. I waited as long as I could, 
but finally Charlie mentioned the late hour. When I didn't respond, he got up, stretched, and 
then left, turning out the light behind him. Reluctantly, I followed. 

As I climbed the stairs, I felt the last of the afternoon's abnormal sense of well-being drain 
from my system, replaced by a dull fear at the thought of what I was going to have to live 
through now. 

I wasn't numb anymore. Tonight would, no doubt, be as horrific as last night. I lay down on 
my bed and curled into a ball in preparation for the onslaught. I squeezed my eyes shut and. . . 
the next thing I next I knew, it was morning. 

I stared at the pale silver light coming through my window, stunned. 

For the first time in more than four months, I'd slept without dreaming. Dreaming or 
screaming. I couldn't tell which emotion was stronger-the relief or the shock. 

I lay still in my bed for a few minutes, waiting for it to come back. Because something must 
be coming. If not the pain, then the numbness. I waited, but nothing happened. I felt more 
rested than I had in a long time. 

I didn't trust this to last. It was a slippery, precarious edge that I balanced on, and it wouldn't 
take much to knock me back down. Just glancing around my room with these suddenly clear 
eyes-noticing how strange it looked, too tidy, l ik e I didn't live here at all-was dangerous. 

I pushed that thought from my mind, and concentrated, as I got dressed, on the fact that I 
was going to see Jacob again today. The thought made me feel almost... hopeful. Maybe it 
would be the same as yesterday. Maybe I wouldn't have to remind myself to look interested 
and to nod or smile at appropriate intervals, the way I had to with everyone else. Maybe... 
but I wouldn't trust this to last, either. Wouldn't trust it to be the same-so easy-as yesterday. 
I wasn't going to set myself up for disappointment like that. 

At breakfast, Charlie was being careful, too. He tried to hide his scrutiny, keeping his eyes on 
his eggs until he thought I wasn't looking. 

"What are you up to today?" he asked, eyeing a loose thread on the edge of his cuff l ik e he 
wasn't paying much attention to my answer. 

"I'm going to hang out with Jacob again." 

He nodded without looking up. "Oh," he said. 

"Do you mind?" I pretended to worry. "I could stay. . ." 




He glanced up quickly, a hint of panic in his eyes. "No, no! You go ahead. Harry was going 
to come up to watch the game with me anyway." 

"Maybe Harry could give Billy a ride up," I suggested. The fewer witnesses the better. 

"That's a great idea." 

I wasn't sure if the game was just an excuse for kicking me out, but he looked excited 
enough now. He headed to the phone while I donned my rain jacket. I felt self-conscious 
with the checkbook shoved in my jacket pocket. It was something I never used. 

Outside, the rain came down l ik e water slopped from a bucket. I had to drive more slowly 
than I wanted to; I could hardly see a car length in front of the truck. But I finally made it 
through the muddy lanes to Jacob's house. Before I'd killed the engine, the front door opened 
and Jacob came running out with a huge black umbrella. 

He held it over my door while I opened it. 

"Charlie called-said you were on your way," Jacob explained with a grin. 

Effortlessly, without a conscious command to the muscles around my lips, my answering 
smile spread across my face. A strange feeling of warmth bubbled up in my throat, despite 
the icy rain splattering on my cheeks. 

"Hi, Jacob." 

"Good call on inviting Billy up." He held up his hand for a high five. 

I had to reach so high to slap his hand that he laughed. 

Harry showed up to get Billy just a few minutes later. Jacob took me on a brief tour of his 
tiny room while we waited to be unsupervised. 

"So where to, Mr. Goodwrench?" I asked as soon as the door closed behind Billy. 

Jacob pulled a folded paper out of his pocket and smoothed it out. "We'll start at the dump 
first, see if we can get lucky. This could get a little expensive," he warned me. "Those bikes 
are going to need a lot of help before they'll run again." My face didn't look worried enough, 
so he continued. "I'm talking about maybe more than a hundred dollars here." 

I pulled my checkbook out, fanned myself with it, and rolled my eyes at his worries. "We're 
covered." 

It was a very strange kind of day. I enjoyed myself. Even at the dump, in the slopping rain 
and ankle-deep mud. I wondered at first if it was just the aftershock of losing the numbness, 
but I didn't think that was enough of an explanation. 




I was beginning to think it was mostly Jacob. It wasn't just that he was always so happy to 
see me, or that he didn't watch me out of the comer of his eye, waiting for me to do 
something that would mark me as crazy or depressed. It was nothing that related to me at all. 

It was Jacob himself. Jacob was simply a perpetually happy person, and he carried that 
happiness with him l ik e an aura, sharing it with whoever was near him. Like an earthbound 
sun, whenever someone was within his gravitational pull, Jacob warmed them. It was 
natural, a part of who he was. No wonder I was so eager to see him. 

Even when he commented on the gaping hole in my dashboard, it didn't send me into a panic 
l ik e it should have. 

"Did the stereo break?" he wondered. 

"Yeah," I lied. 

He poked around in the cavity. "Who took it out? There's a lot of damage. . ." 

"I did," I admitted. 

He laughed. "Maybe you shouldn't touch the motorcycles too much." 

"No problem." 

According to Jacob, we did get lucky at the dump. He was very excited about several 
grease-blackened pieces of twisted metal that he found; I was just impressed that he could 
tell what they were supposed to be. 

From there we went to the Checker Auto Parts down in Hoquiam. In my truck, it was more 
than a two hour drive south on the winding freeway, but the time passed easily with Jacob. 
He chattered about his friends and his school, and I found myself asking questions, not even 
pretending, truly curious to hear what he had to say. 

"I'm doing all the talking," he complained after a long story about Quil and the trouble he'd 
stirred up by asking out a senior's steady girlfriend. "Why don't you take a turn? What's going 
on in Forks? It has to be more exciting than Fa Push." 

"Wrong," I sighed. "There's really nothing. Your friends are a lot more interesting than mine. 
I like your friends. Quil's funny." 

He frowned. "I think Quil l ik es you, too." 

I laughed. "He's a little young for me." 

Jacob's frown deepened. "He's not that much younger than you. It's just a year and a few 
months." 




I had a feeling we weren't talking about Quil anymore. I kept my voice light, teasing. "Sure, 
but, considering the difference in maturity between guys and girls, don't you have to count 
that in dog years? What does that make me, about twelve years older?" 

He laughed, rolling his eyes. "Okay, but if you're going to get picky like that, you have to 
average in size, too. You're so small. I'll have to knock ten years off your total." 

"Five foot four is perfectly average." I sniffed. "It's not my fault you're a freak." 

We bantered like that till Hoquiam, still arguing over the correct formula to determine age-I 
lost two more years because I didn't know how to change a tire, but gained one back for 
being in charge of the bookkeeping at my house-until we were in Checker, and Jacob had to 
concentrate again. We found everything left on his list, and Jacob felt confident that he could 
make a lot of progress with our haul. 

By the time we got back to La Push, I was twenty-three and he was thirty-he was definitely 
weighting s ki lls in his favor. 

I hadn't forgotten the reason for what I was doing. And, even though I was enjoying myself 
more than I'd thought possible, there was no lessening of my original desire. I still wanted to 
cheat. It was senseless, and I really didn't care. I was going to be as reckless as I could 
possibly manage in Forks. I would not be the only keeper of an empty contract. Getting to 
spend time with Jacob was just a much bigger perk than I'd expected. 

Billy wasn't back yet, so we didn't have to be sneaky about unloading our day's spoils. As 
soon as we had everything laid out on the plastic floor next to Jacob's toolbox, he went right 
to work, still talking and laughing while his fingers combed expertly through the metal pieces 
in front of him. 

Jacob's skill with his hands was fascinating. They looked too big for the delicate tasks they 
performed with ease and precision. While he worked, he seemed almost graceful. Unlike 
when he was on his feet; there, his height and big feet made him nearly as dangerous as I 
was. 

Quil and Embry did not show up, so maybe his threat yesterday had been taken seriously. 

The day passed too quickly. It got dark outside the mouth of the garage before I was 
expecting it, and then we heard Billy calling for us. 

I jumped up to help Jacob put things away, hesitating because I wasn't sure what I should 
touch. 

"Just leave it," he said. "I'll work on it later tonight." 

"Don't forget your schoolwork or anything," I said, feeling a little guilty. I didn't want him to 
get in trouble. That plan was just for me. 




Bella?' 



Both our heads snapped up as Charlie's familiar voice wafted through the trees, sounding 
closer than the house. 

"Shoot," I muttered. "Coming!" I yelled toward the house. 

"Let's go." Jacob smiled, enjoying the cloak-and-dagger. He snapped the light off, and for a 
moment I was blind. Jacob grabbed my hand and towed me out of the garage and through 
the trees, his feet finding the fami li ar path easily. His hand was rough, and very warm. 

Despite the path, we were both tripping over our feet in the darkness. So we were also both 
laughing when the house came into view. The laughter did not go deep; it was light and 
superficial, but still nice. I was sure he wouldn't notice the faint hint of hysteria. I wasn't used 
to laughing, and it felt right and also very wrong at the same time. 

Charlie was standing under the little back porch, and Billy was sitting in the doorway behind 
them. 

"Hey, Dad," we both said at the same time, and that started us laughing again. 

Charlie stared at me with wide eyes that flashed down to note Jacob's hand around mine. 
"Billy invited us for dinner," Charlie said to us in an absentminded tone. 

"My super secret recipe for spaghetti. Handed down for generations," Billy said gravely. 

Jacob snorted. "I don't think Ragu's actually been around that long." 

The house was crowded. Harry Clearwater was there, too, with his family-his wife, Sue, 
whom I knew vaguely from my childhood summers in Forks, and his two children. Leah was 
a senior like me, but a year older. She was beautiful in an exotic way-perfect copper skin, 
glistening black hair, eyelashes like feather dusters-and preoccupied. She was on Billy's 
phone when we got in, and she never let it go. Seth was fourteen; he hung on Jacob's every 
word with idolizing eyes. 

There were too many of us for the kitchen table, so Charlie and Harry brought chairs out to 
the yard, and we ate spaghetti off plates on our laps in the dim light from Billy's open door. 
The men talked about the game, and Harry and Charlie made fishing plans. Sue teased her 
husband about his cholesterol and tried, unsuccessfully, to shame h im into eating something 
green and leafy. Jacob talked mostly to me and Seth, who interrupted eagerly whenever 
Jacob seemed in danger of forgetting him. Charlie watched me, trying to be inconspicuous 
about it, with pleased but cautious eyes. 

It was loud and sometimes confusing as everyone talked over everyone else, and the laughter 
from one joke interrupted the telling of another. I didn't have to speak often, but I smiled a 
lot, and only because I felt like it. 




I didn't want to leave. 



This was Washington, though, and the inevitable rain eventually broke up the party; Billy's 
living room was much too small to provide an option for continuing the get-together. Harry 
had driven Charlie down, so we rode together in my truck on the way back home. He asked 
about my day, and I told mostly the truth-that I'd gone with Jacob to look at parts and then 
watched him work in his garage. 

"You think you'll visit again anytime soon?" he wondered, trying to be casual about it. 

"Tomorrow after school," I admitted. "I'll take homework, don't worry." 

"You be sure to do that," he ordered, trying to disguise his satisfaction. 

I was nervous when we got to the house. I didn't want to go upstairs. The warmth of Jacob's 
presence was fading and, in its absence, the anxiety grew stronger. I was sure I wouldn't get 
away with two peaceful nights of sleep in a row. 

To put bedtime off, I checked my e-mail; there was a new message from Renee. 

She wrote about her day, a new book club that rilled the time slot of the meditation classes 
she'd just quit, her week subbing in the second grade, missing her kindergarteners. She wrote 
that Phil was enjoying his new coaching job, and that they were planning a second 
honeymoon trip to Disney World. 

And I noticed that the whole thing read l ik e a journal entry, rather than a letter to someone 
else. Remorse flooded through me, leaving an uncomfortable sting behind. Some daughter I 
was. 

I wrote back to her quickly, commenting on each part of her letter, volunteering information 
of my own-describing the spaghetti party at Billy's and how I felt watching Jacob build 
useful things out of small pieces of metal-awed and slightly envious. I made no reference to 
the change this letter would be from the ones she'd received in the last several months. I 
could barely remember what I'd written to her even as recently as last week, but I was sure it 
wasn't very responsive. The more I thought about it, the guiltier I felt; I really must have 
worried her. 

I stayed up extra late after that, finishing more homework than strictly necessary. But neither 
sleep deprivation nor the time spent with Jacob-being almost happy in a shallow kind of 
way-could keep the dream away for two nights in a row. 

I woke shuddering, my scream muffled by the pillow. 

As the dim morning light filtered through the fog outside my window, I lay still in bed and 
tried to shake off the dream. There had been a small difference last night, and I concentrated 
on that. 




Last night I had not been alone in the woods. Sam Uley-the man who had pulled me from 
the forest floor that night I couldn't bear to think of consciously-was there. It was an odd, 
unexpected alteration. The man's dark eyes had been surprisingly unfriendly, filled with some 
secret he didn't seem inclined to share. I'd stared at him as often as my frantic searching had 
allowed; it made me uncomfortable, under all the usual panic, to have him there. Maybe that 
was because, when I didn't look directly at him, his shape seemed to shiver and change in my 
peripheral vision. Yet he did nothing but stand and watch. Unlike the time when we had met 
in reality, he did not offer me his help. 

Charlie stared at me during breakfast, and I tried to ignore him. I supposed I deserved it. I 
couldn't expect h im not to worry. It would probably be weeks before he stopped watching 
for the return of the zombie, and I would just have to try to not let it bother me. After all, I 
would be watching for the return of the zombie, too. Two days was hardly long enough to 
call me cured. 

School was the opposite. Now that I was paying attention, it was clear that no one was 
watching here. 

I remembered the first day I'd come to Forks High School-how desperately I'd wished that I 
could turn gray, fade into the wet concrete of the sidewalk l ik e an oversized chameleon. It 
seemed I was getting that wish answered, a year late. 

It was l ik e I wasn't there. Even my teachers' eyes slid past my seat as if it were empty. 

I listened all through the morning, hearing once again the voices of the people around me. I 
tried to catch up on what was going on, but the conversations were so disjointed that I gave 
up. 

Jessica didn't look up when I sat down next to her in Calculus. 

"Hey, Jess," I said with put-on nonchalance. "How was the rest of your weekend?" 

She looked at me with suspicious eyes. Could she still be angry? Or was she just too 
impatient to deal with a crazy person? 

"Super," she said, turning back to her book. 

"That's good," I mumbled. 

The figure of speech cold shoulder seemed to have some literal truth to it. I could feel the 
warm air blowing from the floor vents, but I was still too cold. I took the jacket off the back 
of my chair and put it on again. 

My fourth hour class got out late, and the lunch table I always sat at was full by the time I 
arrived. Mike was there, Jessica and Angela, Conner, Tyler, Eric and Lauren. Katie Marshall, 
the redheaded junior who lived around the comer from me, was sitting with Eric, and Austin 




Marks-older brother to the boy with the motorcycles-was next to her. I wondered how long 
they'd been sitting here, unable to remember if this was the first day or something that was a 
regular habit. 

I was beginning to get annoyed with myself. I might as well have been packed in Styrofoam 
peanuts through the last semester. 

No one looked up when I sat down next to Mike, even though the chair squealed stridently 
against the linoleum as I dragged it back. 

I tried to catch up with the conversation. 

Mike and Conner were talking sports, so I gave up on that one at once. 

"Where's Ben today?" Lauren was asking Angela. I perked up, interested. I wondered if that 
meant Angela and Ben were still together. 

I barely recognized Lauren. She'd cut off all her blond, com-silk hair-now she had a pixie cut 
so short that the back was shaved like a boy. What an odd thing for her to do. I wished I 
knew the reason behind it. Did she get gum stuck in it? Did she sell it? Had all the people 
she was habitually nasty to caught her behind the gym and scalped her? I decided it wasn't 
fair for me to judge her now by my former opinion. For all I knew, she'd turned into a nice 
person. 

"Ben's got the stomach flu," Angela said in her quiet, calm voice. "Hopefully it's just some 
twenty-four hour thing. He was really sick last night." 

Angela had changed her hair, too. She'd grown out her layers. 

"What did you two do this weekend?" Jessica asked, not sounding as if she cared about the 
answer. I'd bet that this was just an opener so she could tell her own stories. I wondered if 
she would talk about Port Angeles with me sitting two seats away? Was I that invisible, that 
no one would feel uncomfortable discussing me while I was here? 

"We were going to have a picnic Saturday, actually, but... we changed our minds," Angela 
said. There was an edge to her voice that caught my interest. 

Jess, not so much. "That's too bad," she said, about to launch into her story. But I wasn't the 
only one who was paying attention. 

"What happened?" Lauren asked curiously. 

"Well," Angela said, seeming more hesitant than usual, though she was always reserved, "we 
drove up north, almost to the hot springs-there's a good spot just about a mile up the trail. 
But, when we were halfway there... we saw something." 



Saw something? What?" Lauren's pale eyebrows pulled together. Even Jess seemed to be 




listening now. 



"I don't know," Angela said. "We think it was a bear. It was black, anyway, but it seemed... 
too big." 

Lauren snorted. "Oh, not you, too!" Her eyes turned mocking, and I decided I didn't need to 
give her the benefit of the doubt. Obviously her personality had not changed as much as her 
hair. "Tyler tried to sell me that one last week." 

"You're not going to see any bears that close to the resort," Jessica said, siding with Lauren. 

"Really," Angela protested in a low voice, looking down at the table. "We did see it." 

Lauren snickered. Mike was still talking to Conner, not paying attention to the girls. 

"No, she's right," I threw in impatiently. "We had a h ik er in just Saturday who saw the bear, 
too, Angela. He said it was huge and black and just outside of town, didn't he, Mike?" 

There was a moment of silence. Every pair of eyes at the table turned to stare at me in shock. 
The new girl, Katie, had her mouth hanging open l ik e she'd just witnessed an explosion. 
Nobody moved. 

"Mike?" I muttered, mortified. "Remember the guy with the bear story?" 

"S-sure," Mike stuttered after a second. I didn't know why he was looking at me so strangely. 
I talked to him at work, didn't I? Did I? I thought so. . . 

Mike recovered. "Yeah, there was a guy who said he saw a huge black bear right at the 
trailhead-bigger than a grizzly," he confirmed. 

"Hmph." Lauren turned to Jessica, her shoulders stiff, and changed the subject. 

"Did you hear back from USC?" she asked. 

Everyone else looked away, too, except for Mike and Angela. Angela smiled at me 
tentatively, and I hurried to return the smile. 

"So, what did you do this weekend, Bella?" Mike asked, curious, but oddly wary. 

Everyone but Lauren looked back, waiting for my response. 

"Friday night, Jessica and I went to a movie in Port Angeles. And then I spent Saturday 
afternoon and most of Sunday down at La Push." 

The eyes flickered to Jessica and back to me. Jess looked irritated. I wondered if she didn't 
want anyone to know she'd gone out with me, or whether she just wanted to be the one to 
tell the story. 




"What movie did you see?" Mike asked, starting to smile. 

" Dead End-\he one with the zombies." I grinned in encouragement. Maybe some of the 
damage I'd done in these past zombie months was reparable. 

"I heard that was scary. Did you think so?" Mike was eager to continue the conversation. 
"Bella had to leave at the end, she was so freaked," Jessica inserted with a sly smile. 

I nodded, trying to look embarrassed. "It was pretty scary." 

Mike didn't stop asking me questions till lunch was over. Gradually, the others were able to 
start up their own conversations again, though they still looked at me a lot. Angela talked 
mostly to Mike and me, and, when I got up to dump my tray, she followed. 

"Thanks," she said in a low voice when we were away from the table. 

"For what?" 

"Speaking up, sticking up for me." 

"No problem." 

She looked at me with concern, but not the offensive, maybe-she's-lost-it kind. "Are you 
okay?" 

This is why I'd picked Jessica over Angela-though I'd always l ik ed Angela more-for the girls' 
night movie. Angela was too perceptive. 

"Not completely," I admitted. "But I'm a little bit better." 

"I'm glad," she said. "I've missed you." 

Lauren and Jessica strolled by us then, and I heard Lauren whisper loudly, "Oh, joy Bella's 
back." 

Angela rolled her eyes at them, and smiled at me in encouragement. 

I sighed It was like I was starting all over again. 

"What's today's date?" I wondered suddenly. 

"It's January nineteenth." 

"Hmm." 

"What is it?" Angela asked. 

"It was a year ago yesterday that I had my first day here," I mused. 




"Nothing's changed much," Angela muttered, looking after Lauren and Jessica. 
"I know, I agreed I was just thinking the same thing." 




7 REPETITION 



I WASN'T SURE WHAT THE HELL I WAS DOING HERE Was I trying to push myself 
back into the zombie stupor? Had I turned masochistic-developed a taste for torture? I 
should have gone straight down to La Push I felt much, much healthier around Jacob This 
was not a healthy thing to do. 

But I continued to drive slowly down the overgrown lane, twisting through the trees that 
arched over me l ik e a green, living tunnel My hands were shaking, so I tightened my grip on 
the steering wheel. 

I knew that part of the reason I did this was the nightmare, now that I was really awake, the 
nothingness of the dream gnawed on my nerves, a dog worrying a bone. 

There was something to search for. Unattainable and impossible, uncaring and distracted... 
but he was out there, somewhere. I had to believe that. 

The other part was the strange sense of repetition I'd felt at school today, the coincidence of 
the date. The feeling that I was starting over-perhaps the way my first day would have gone 
if I'd really been the most unusual person in the cafeteria that afternoon. 

The words ran through my head, tonelessly, l ik e I was reading them rather than hearing them 
spoken: 

It will be as if I'd never existed. 

I was lying to myself by splitting my reason for coming here into just two parts. I didn't want 
to admit the strongest motivation. Because it was mentally unsound. 

The truth was that I wanted to hear his voice again, like I had in the strange delusion Friday 
night. For that brief moment, when his voice came from some other part of me than my 
conscious memory, when his voice was perfect and honey smooth rather than the pale echo 
my memories usually produced, I was able to remember without pain. It hadn't lasted; the 
pain had caught up with me, as I was sure it would for this fool's errand. But those precious 
moments when I could hear him again were an irresistible lure. I had to find some way to 
repeat the experience. . . or maybe the better word was episode. 

I was hoping that deja vu was the key. So I was going to his home, a place I hadn't been 
since my ill-fated birthday party, so many months ago. 

The thick, almost jungle-like growth crawled slowly past my windows. The drive wound on 
and on. I started to go faster, getting edgy. How long had I been driving? Shouldn't I have 
reached the house yet? The lane was so overgrown that it did not look fa mili ar. 

What if I couldn't find it? I shivered. What if there was no tangible proof at all? 




Then there was the break in the trees that I was looking for, only it was not so pronounced as 
before. The flora here did not wait long to reclaim any land that was left unguarded. The tall 
ferns had infiltrated the meadow around the house, crowding against the trunks of the 
cedars, even the wide porch. It was l ik e the lawn had been flooded-waist-high-with green, 
feathery waves. 

And the house was there, but it was not the same. Though nothing had changed on the 
outside, the emptiness screamed from the blank windows. It was creepy. For the first time 
since I'd seen the beautiful house, it looked l ik e a fitting haunt for vampires. 

I hit the brakes, looking away. I was afraid to go farther. 

But nothing happened. No voice in my head. 

So I left the engine running and jumped out into the fem sea. Maybe, like Friday night, if I 
walked forward. . . 

I approached the barren, vacant face slowly, my truck rumbling out a comforting roar behind 
me. I stopped when I got to the porch stairs, because there was nothing here. No lingering 
sense of their presence... of his presence. The house was solidly here, but it meant little. Its 
concrete reality would not counteract the nothingness of the nightmares. 

I didn't go any closer. I didn't want to look in the windows. I wasn't sure which would be 
harder to see. If the rooms were bare, echoing empty from floor to ceiling, that would 
certainly hurt. Like my grandmother's funeral, when my mother had insisted that I stay 
outside during the viewing. She had said that I didn't need to see Gran that way, to 
remember her that way, rather than alive. 

But wouldn't it be worse if there were no change? If the couches sat just as I'd last seen 
them, the paintings on the walls-worse still, the piano on its low platform? It would be 
second only to the house disappearing all together, to see that there was no physical 
possession that tied them in anyway. That everything remained, untouched and forgotten, 
behind them. 

Just l ik e me. 

I turned my back on the gaping emptiness and hurried to my truck. I nearly ran. I was anxious 
to be gone, to get back to the human world. I felt hideously empty, and I wanted to see 
Jacob. Maybe I was developing a new kind of sickness, another addiction, like the numbness 
before. I didn't care. I pushed my truck as fast as it would go as I barreled toward my fix. 

Jacob was waiting for me. My chest seemed to relax as soon as I saw him, making it easier to 
breathe. 



Hey, Bella," he called. 




I smiled in relief. "Hey, Jacob," I waved at Billy, who was looking out the window. 

"Let's get to work," Jacob said in a low but eager voice. 

I was somehow able to laugh. "You seriously aren't sick of me yet?" I wondered. He must be 
starting to ask himself how desperate I was for company. 

Jacob led the way around the house to his garage. 

"Nope. Not yet." 

"Please let me know when I start getting on your nerves. I don't want to be a pain." 

"Okay." He laughed, a throaty sound. "I wouldn't hold your breath for that, though." 

When I walked into the garage, I was shocked to see the red bike standing up, looking like a 
motorcycle rather than a pile of jagged metal. 

"Jake, you're amazing," I breathed. 

He laughed again. "I get obsessive when I have a project." He shrugged. "If I had any brains 
I'd drag it out a little bit." 

"Why?" 

He looked down, pausing for so long that I wondered if he hadn't heard my question. Finally, 
he asked me, "Bella, if I told you that I couldn't fix these bikes, what would you say?" 

I didn't answer right away, either, and he glanced up to check my expression. 

"I would say. . . that's too bad, but I'll bet we could figure out something else to do. If we got 
really desperate, we could even do homework." 

Jacob smiled, and his shoulders relaxed. He sat down next to the bike and picked up a 
wrench. "So you think you'll still come over when I'm done, then?" 

"Is that what you meant?" I shook my head. "I guess I am taking advantage of your very 
underpriced mechanical s ki lls. But as long as you let me come over, I'll be here." 

"Hoping to see Quil again?" he teased. 

"You caught me." 

He chuckled. "You really l ik e spending time with me?" he asked, marveling. 

"Very, very much. And I'll prove it. I have to work tomorrow, but Wednesday we'll do 
something nonmechanical." 




'Like what? 



"I have no idea. We can go to my place so you won't be tempted to be obsessive. You could 
bring your schoolwork-you have to be getting behind, because I know I am." 

"Homework might be a good idea." He made a face, and I wondered how much he was 
leaving undone to be with me. 

"Yes," I agreed. "We'll have to start being responsible occasionally, or Billy and Charlie aren't 
going to be so easygoing about this." I made a gesture indicating the two of us as a single 
entity. He l ik ed that-he beamed. 

"Homework once a week?" he proposed. 

"Maybe we'd better go with twice," I suggested, thinking of the pile I'd just been assigned 
today. 

He sighed a heavy sigh. Then he reached over his toolbox to a paper grocery sack. He pulled 
out two cans of soda, cracking one open and handing it to me. He opened the second, and 
held it up ceremoniously. 

"Here's to responsibility," he toasted. "Twice a week." 

"And recklessness every day in between," I emphasized. 

He grinned and touched his can to mine. 



I got home later than I'd planned and found Charlie had ordered a pizza rather than wait for 
me. He wouldn't let me apologize. 

"I don't mind," he assured me. "You deserve a break from all the cooking, anyway." 

I knew he was just relieved that I was still acting l ik e a normal person, and he was not about 
to rock the boat. 

I checked my e-mail before I started on my homework, and there was a long one from Renee. 
She gushed over every detail I'd provided her with, so I sent back another exhaustive 
description of my day. Everything but the motorcycles. Even happy-go-lucky Renee was 
likely to be alarmed by that. 

School Tuesday had its ups and downs. Angela and Mike seemed ready to welcome me back 
with open arms-to kindly overlook my few months of aberrant behavior. Jess was more 
resistant. I wondered if she needed a formal written apology for the Port Angeles incident. 



Mike was animated and chatty at work. It was l ik e he'd stored up the semester's worth of 




talk, and it was all spilling out now. I found that I was able to smile and laugh with him, 
though it wasn't as effortless as it was with Jacob. It seemed harmless enough, until quitting 
time. 

Mike put the closed sign in the window while I folded my vest and shoved it under the 
counter. 

"This was fun tonight," Mike said happily. 

"Yeah," I agreed, though I'd much rather have spent the afternoon in the garage. 

"It's too bad that you had to leave the movie early last week." 

I was a little confused by his train of thought. I shrugged. "I'm just a wimp, I guess." 

"What I mean is, you should go to a better movie, something you'd enjoy," he explained. 

"Oh," I muttered, still confused. 

"Like maybe this Friday. With me. We could go see something that isn't scary at all." 

I bit my lip. 

I didn't want to screw things up with Mike, not when he was one of the only people ready to 
forgive me for being crazy. But this, again, felt far too fami li ar. Like the last year had never 
happened. I wished I had Jess as an excuse this time. 

"Like a date?" I asked. Honesty was probably the best policy at this point. Get it over with. 

He processed the tone of my voice "If you want. But it doesn't have to be l ik e that." 

"I don't date," I said slowly, realizing how true that was. That whole world seemed 
impossibly distant. 

"Just as friends?" he suggested. His clear blue eyes were not as eager now. I hoped he really 
meant that we could be friends anyway. 

"That would be fun. But I actually have plans already this Friday, so maybe next week?" 
"What are you doing?" he asked, less casually than I think he wanted to sound. 

"Homework. I have a. . . study session planned with a friend." 

"Oh. Okay. Maybe next week." 

He walked me to my car, less exuberant than before. It reminded me so clearly of my first 
months in Forks. I'd come full circle, and now everything felt l ik e an echo-an empty echo, 
devoid of the interest it used to have. 




The next night, Charlie didn't seem the smallest bit surprised to find Jacob and me sprawled 
across the living room floor with our books scattered around us, so I guessed that he and 
Billy were talking behind our backs. 

"Hey, kids," he said, his eyes straying to the kitchen. The smell of the lasagna I'd spent the 
afternoon making-while Jacob watched and occasionally sampled-wafted down the hall; I 
was being good, trying to atone for all the pizza. 

Jacob stayed for dinner, and took a plate home for Billy. He grudgingly added another year to 
my negotiable age for being a good cook. 

Friday was the garage, and Saturday, after my shift at Newton's, was homework again. 
Charlie felt secure enough in my sanity to spend the day fishing with Harry. When he got 
back, we were all done-feeling very sensible and mature about it, too-and watching Monster 
Garage on the Discovery Channel. 

"I probably ought to go." Jacob sighed. "It's later than I thought." 

"Okay, fine," I grumbled. "I'll take you home." 

He laughed at my unwilling expression-it seemed to please him. 

"Tomorrow, back to work," I said as soon as we were safe in the truck. "What time do you 
want me to come up?" 

There was an unexplained excitement in his answering smile. "I'll call you first, okay?" 

"Sure." I frowned to myself, wondering what was up. His smile widened. 

I cleaned the house the next morning-waiting for Jacob to call and trying to shake off the 
Litest nightmare. The scenery had changed. Last night I'd wandered in a wide sea of ferns 
interspersed with huge hemlock trees. There was nothing else there, and I was lost, 
wandering aimless and alone, searching for nothing. I wanted to kick myself for the stupid 
field trip last week. I shoved the dream out of my conscious mind, hoping it would stay 
locked up somewhere and not escape again. 

Charlie was outside washing the cruiser, so when the phone rang, I dropped the toilet brush 
and ran downstairs to answer it. 

"Hello?" I asked breathlessly. 

"Bella," Jacob said, a strange, formal tone to his voice. 

"Hey, Jake." 

"I believe that. . . we have a date" he said, his tone thick with implications. 




It took me a second before I got it. "They're done? I can't believe it!" What perfect timing. I 
needed something to distract me from nightmares and nothingness. 

"Yeah, they run and everything." 

"Jacob, you are absolutely, without a doubt, the most talented and wonderful person I know. 
You get ten years for this one." 

"Cool! I'm middle-aged now." 

I laughed. "I'm on my way up!" 

I threw the cleaning supplies under the bathroom counter and grabbed my jacket. 

"Headed to see Jake," Charlie said when I ran past him. It wasn't really a question. 

"Yep," I replied as I jumped in my truck. 

"I'll be at the station later," Charlie called after me. 

"Okay," I yelled back, turning the key. 

Charlie said something else, but I couldn't hear him clearly over the roar of the engine. It 
sounded sort of like, "Where's the fire?" 

I parked my truck off to the side of the Blacks' house, close to the trees, to make it easier for 
us to sneak the bikes out. When I got out, a splash of color caught my eye-two shiny 
motorcycles, one red, one black, were hidden under a spruce, invisible from the house. Jacob 
was prepared. 

There was a piece of blue ribbon tied in a small bow around each of the handlebars. I was 
laughing at that when Jacob ran out of the house. 

"Ready?" he asked in a low voice, his eyes sparkling. 

I glanced over his shoulder, and there was no sign of Billy. 

"Yeah," I said, but I didn't feel quite as excited as before; I was trying to imagine myself 
actually on the motorcycle. 

Jacob loaded the bikes into the bed of the truck with ease, laying them carefully on their 
sides so they didn't show. 

"Let's go," he said, his voice higher than usual with excitement. "I know the perfect spot-no 
one will catch us there." 



We drove south out of town. The dirt road wove in and out of the forest-sometimes there 
was nothing but trees, and then there would suddenly be a breathtaking glimpse of the 




Pacific Ocean, reaching to the horizon, dark gray under the clouds. We were above the shore, 
on top of the cliffs that bordered the beach here and the view seemed to stretch on forever. 

I was driving slowly, so that I could safely stare out across the ocean now and then, as the 
road wound closer to the sea cliffs. Jacob was talking about finishing the bikes, but his 
descriptions were getting technical, so I wasn't paying close attention. 

That was when I noticed four figures standing on a rocky ledge, much too close to the 
precipice. I couldn't tell from the distance how old they were, but I assumed they were men. 
Despite the chill in the air today, they seemed to be wearing only shorts. 

As I watched, the tallest person stepped closer to the brink. I slowed automatically, my foot 
hesitating over the brake pedal. 

And then he threw himself off the edge. 

"No!" I shouted, stomping down on the brake. 

"What's wrong?" Jacob shouted back, alarmed. 

"That guy-he just jumped off the clijp. Why didn't they stop him? We've got to call an 
ambulance!" I threw open my door and started to get out, which made no sense at all. The 
fastest way to a phone was to drive back to Billy's. But I couldn't believe what I'd just seen. 
Maybe, subconsciously, I hoped I would see something different without the glass of the 
windshield in the way. 

Jacob laughed, and I spun to stare at him wildly. How could he be so calloused, so 
cold-blooded? 

"They're just cliff diving, Bella. Recreation. La Push doesn't have a mall, you know." He was 
teasing, but there was a strange note of irritation in his voice. 

"Cliff diving?" I repeated, dazed. I stared in disbelief as a second figure stepped to the edge, 
paused, and then very gracefully leaped into space. He fell for what seemed l ik e an eternity to 
me, finally cutting smoothly into the dark gray waves below. 

"Wow. It's so high." I slid back into my seat, still staring wide-eyed at the two remaining 
divers. "It must be a hundred feet." 

"Well, yeah, most of us jump from lower down, that rock that juts out from the cliff about 
halfway." He pointed out his window. The place he indicated did seem much more 
reasonable. "Those guys are insane. Probably showing off how tough they are. I mean, really, 
it's freezing today. That water can't feel good." He made a disgruntled face, as if the stunt 
personally offended him. It surprised me a little. I would have thought Jacob was nearly 
impossible to upset. 



You jump off the cliff?" I hadn't missed the "us. 




Sure, sure." He shrugged and grinned. "It's fun. A little scary, kind of a rush. 



I looked back at the cliffs, where the third figure was pacing the edge. I'd never witnessed 
anything so reckless in all my life. My eyes widened, and I smiled. "Jake, you have to take me 
cliff diving." 

He frowned back at me, his face disapproving. "Bella, you just wanted to call an ambulance 
for Sam," he reminded me. I was surprised that he could tell who it was from this distance. 

"I want to try," I insisted, start ing to get out of the car again. 

Jacob grabbed my wrist. "Not today, all right? Can we at least wait for a warmer day?" 

"Okay, fine," I agreed. With the door open, the glacial breeze was raising goose bumps on my 
arm. "But I want to go soon." 

"Soon." He rolled his eyes. "Sometimes you're a little strange, Bella. Do you know that?" 

I sighed. "Yes." 

"And we're not jumping off the top." 

I watched, fascinated, as the third boy made a running start and flung himself farther into the 
empty air than the other two. He twisted and cartwheeled through space as he fell, l ik e he 
was skydiving. He looked absolutely free-unthinking and utterly irresponsible. 

"Fine," I agreed. "Not the first time, anyway." 

Now Jacob sighed. 

"Are we going to try out the bikes or not?" he demanded. 

"Okay, okay," I said, tearing my eyes away from the last person waiting on the cliff. I put my 
seat belt back on and closed the door. The engine was still running, roaring as it idled. We 
started down the road again. 

"So who were those guys-the crazy ones?" I wondered. 

He made a disgusted sound in the back of his throat. "The La Push gang." 

"You have a gang?" I asked. I realized that I sounded impressed. 

He laughed once at my reaction. "Not like that. I swear, they're like hall monitors gone bad. 
They don't start fights, they keep the peace." He snorted. "There was this guy from up 
somewhere by the Makah rez, big guy too, scary-looking. Well, word got around that he was 
selling meth to kids, and Sam Uley and his disciples ran him off our land. They're all about 
our land , and tribe pride... it's getting ridiculous. The worst part is that the council takes 
them seriously. Embry said that the council actually meets with Sam." He shook his head, 




face full of resentment. "Embry also heard from Leah Clearwater that they call themselves 
'protectors' or something like that." 

Jacob's hands were clenched into fists, as if he'd like to hit something. I'd never seen this side 
of h im . 

I was surprised to hear Sam Uley's name. I didn't want it to bring back the images from my 
nightmare, so I made a quick observation to distract myself. "You don't l ik e them very 
much." 

"Does it show?" he asked sarcastically. 

"Well... It doesn't sound l ik e they're doing anything bad." I tried to soothe him, to make h im 
cheerful again. "Just sort of annoyingly goody-two-shoes for a gang." 

"Yeah. Annoying is a good word. They're always showing off-l ik e the cliff thing. They act 
like... like, I don't know. Like tough guys. I was hanging out at the store with Embry and 
Quil once, last semester, and Sam came by with his followers, Jared and Paul. Quil said 
something, you know how he's got a big mouth, and it pissed Paul off. His eyes got all dark, 
and he sort of smiled-no, he showed his teeth but he didn't smile-and it was like he was so 
mad he was shaking or something. But Sam put his hand against Paul's chest and shook his 
head. Paul looked at him for a minute and calmed down. Honestly, it was l ik e Sam was 
holding him back-like Paul was going to tear us up if Sam didn't stop him." He groaned. 
"Like a bad western. You know, Sam's a pretty big guy, he's twenty. But Paul's just sixteen, 
too, shorter than me and not as beefy as Quil. I think any one of us could take him." 

"Tough guys," I agreed. I could see it in my head as he described it, and it reminded me of 
something. . . a trio of tall, dark men standing very still and close together in my father's living 
room. The picture was sideways, because my head was lying against the couch while Dr. 
Gerandy and Charlie leaned over me. . . Had that been Sam's gang? 

I spoke quickly again to divert myself from the bleak memories. "Isn't Sam a little too old for 
this kind of thing?" 

"Yeah. He was supposed to go to college, but he stayed. And no one gave him any crap 
about it, either. The whole council pitched a fit when my sister turned down a partial 
scholarship and got married. But, oh no, Sam Uley can do no wrong." 

His face was set in unfami li ar lines of outrage-outrage and something else I didn't recognize 
at first. 

"It all sounds really annoying and... strange. But I don't get why you're taking it so 
personally." I peeked over at his face, hoping I hadn't offended him. He was suddenly calm, 
staring out the side window. 



You just missed the turn," he said in an even voice. 




I executed a very wide U-turn, nearly hitting a tree as my circle ran the truck halfway off the 
road. 



"Thanks for the heads-up," I muttered as I started up the side road. 

"Sorry, I wasn't paying attention." 

It was quiet for a brief minute. 

"You can stop anywhere along here," he said softly. 

I pulled over and cut the engine. My ears rang in the silence that followed. We both got out, 
and Jacob headed around to the back to get the bikes. I tried to read his expression. 
Something more was bothering him. I'd hit a nerve. 

He smiled halfheartedly as he pushed the red bike to my side. "Happy late birthday. Are you 
ready for this?" 

"I think so." The bike suddenly looked intimidating, frightening, as I realized I would soon be 
astride it. 

"We'll take it slow," he promised. I gingerly leaned the motorcycle against the truck's fender 
while he went to get his. 

"Jake. . ."I hesitated as he came back around the truck. 

"Yeah?" 

"What's really bothering you? About the Sam thing, I mean? Is there something else?" I 
watched his face. He grimaced, but he didn't seem angry. He looked at the dirt and kicked 
his shoe against the front tire of his bike again and again, l ik e he was keeping time. 

He sighed. "It's just... the way they treat me. It creeps me out." The words started to rush 
out now. "You know, the council is supposed to be made up of equals, but if there was a 
leader, it would be my dad. I've never been able to figure out why people treat him the way 
they do. Why his opinion counts the most. It's got something to do with his father and his 
father's father. My great-grandpa, Ephraim Black, was sort of the last chief we had, and they 
still listen to Billy, maybe because of that. 

"But I'm just l ik e everyone else. Nobody treats me special... until now." 

That caught me off guard. "Sam treats you special?" 

"Yeah," he agreed, looking up at me with troubled eyes. "He looks at me l ik e he's waiting for 
something... l ik e I'm going to join his stupid gang someday. He pays more attention to me 
than any of the other guys. I hate it." 




"You don't have to join anything." My voice was angry. This was really upsetting Jacob, and 
that infuriated me. Who did these "protectors" think they were? 

"Yeah." His foot kept up its rhythm against the tire. 

"What?" I could tell there was more. 

He frowned, his eyebrows pulling up in a way that looked sad and worried rather than angry. 
"It's Embry. He's been avoiding me lately." 

The thoughts didn't seem connected, but I wondered if I was to blame for the problems with 
his friend. "You've been hanging out with me a lot," I reminded him, feeling selfish. I'd been 
monopolizing him. 

"No, that's not it. It's not just me-it's Quil, too, and everyone. Embry missed a week of 
school, but he was never home when we tried to see him. And when he came back, he 
looked... he looked freaked out. Terrified. Quil and I both tried to get him to tell us what 
was wrong, but he wouldn't talk to either one of us." 

I stared at Jacob, biting my lip anxiously-he was really frightened. But he didn't look at me. 
He watched his own foot kicking the rubber as if it belonged to someone else. The tempo 
increased. 

"Then this week, out of nowhere, Embry's hanging out with Sam and the rest of them. He 
was out on the cliffs today." His voice was low and tense. 

He finally looked at me. "Bella, they bugged him even more than they bother me. He didn't 
want anything to do with them. And now Embry's following Sam around l ik e he's joined a 
cult. 

"And that's the way it was with Paul. Just exactly the same. He wasn't friends with Sam at 
all. Then he stopped coming to school for a few weeks, and, when he came back, suddenly 
Sam owned him. I don't know what it means. I can't figure it out, and I feel like I have to, 
because Embry's my friend and. . . Sam's looking at me funny . . and. . . " He trailed off. 

"Have you talked to Billy about this?" I asked. His horror was spreading to me. I had ch il ls 
running on the back of my neck. 

Now there was anger on his face. "Yes," he snorted. "That was helpful." 

"What did he say?" 

Jacob's expression was sarcastic, and when he spoke, his voice mocked the deep tones of his 
father's voice. "It's nothing you need to worry about now, Jacob. In a few years, if you 
don't... well, I'll explain later." And then his voice was his own. "What am I supposed to get 
from that? Is he trying to say it's some stupid puberty, coming-of-age thing? This is 
something else. Something wrong." 




He was biting his lower lip and clenching his hands. He looked l ik e he was about to cry. 

I threw my arms around h im instinctively, wrapping them around his waist and pressing my 
face against his chest. He was so big, I felt like I was a child hugging a grown-up. 

"Oh, Jake, it'll be okay!" I promised. "If it gets worse you can come live with me and Charlie. 
Don't be scared, we'll think of something!" 

He was frozen for a second, and then his long arms wrapped hesitantly around me. "Thanks, 
Bella." His voice was huskier than usual. 

We stood like that for a moment, and it didn't upset me; in fact, I felt comforted by the 
contact. This didn't feel anything l ik e the last time someone had embraced me this way. This 
was friendship. And Jacob was very warm. 

It was strange for me, being this close-emotionally rather than physically, though the 
physical was strange for me, too-to another human being. It wasn't my usual style. I didn't 
normally relate to people so easily, on such a basic level. 

Not human beings. 

"If this is how you're going to react, I'll freak out more often." Jacob's voice was light, normal 
again, and his laughter rumbled against my ear. His fingers touched my hair, soft and 
tentative. 

Well, it was friendship for me. 

I pulled away quickly, laughing with him, but determined to put things back in perspective at 
once. 

"It's hard to believe I'm two years older than you," I said, emphasizing the word older. "You 
make me feel l ik e a dwarf." Standing this close to him, I really had to crane my neck to see 
his face. 

"You're forgetting I'm in my forties, of course." 

"Oh, that's right." 

He patted my head. "You're l ik e a little doll," he teased. "A porcelain doll." 

I rolled my eyes, taking another step away. "Let's not start with the albino cracks." 

"Seriously, Bella, are you sure you're not?" He stretched his russet arm out next to mine. The 
difference wasn't flattering. "I've never seen anyone paler than you... well, except for-" He 
broke off, and I looked away, trying to not understand what he had been about to say. 



So are we going to ride or what? 




"Let's do it," I agreed, more enthusiastic than I would have been half a minute ago. His 
unfinished sentence reminded me of why I was here. 




8. ADRENALINE 



"OKAY, WHERE'S YOUR CLUTCH?" 

I pointed to the lever on my left handlebar. Letting go of the grip was a mistake. The heavy 
bike wobbled underneath me, threatening to knock me sidewise. I grabbed the handle again, 
trying to hold it straight. 

"Jacob, it won't stay up," I complained. 

"It will when you're moving," he promised. "Now where's your brake?" 

"Behind my right foot." 

"Wrong." 

He grabbed my right hand and curled my fingers around the lever over the throttle. 

"But you said-" 

"This is the brake you want. Don't use the back brake now, that's for later, when you know 
what you're doing." 

"That doesn't sound right," I said suspiciously. "Aren't both brakes kind of important?" 

"Forget the back brake, okay? Here-" He wrapped his hand around mine and made me 
squeeze the lever down. " That is how you brake. Don't forget." He squeezed my hand 
another time. 

"Fine," I agreed. 

"Throttle?" 

I twisted the right grip. 

"Gearshift?" 

I nudged it with my left calf. 

"Very good. I think you've got all the parts down. Now you just have to get it moving." 

"Uh-huh," I muttered, afraid to say more. My stomach was contorting strangely and I thought 
my voice might crack. I was terrified. I tried to tell myself that the fear was pointless. I'd 
already lived through the worst thing possible. In comparison with that, why should anything 
frighten me now? I should be able to look death in the face and laugh. 



My stomach wasn't buying it. 




I stared down the long stretch of dirt road, bordered by thick misty green on every side. The 
road was sandy and damp. Better than mud. 

"I want you to hold down the clutch," Jacob instructed. 

I wrapped my fingers around the clutch. 

"Now this is crucial, Bella," Jacob stressed. "Don't let go of that, okay? I want you to pretend 
that I've handed you a live grenade. The pin is out and you are holding down the spoon." 

I squeezed tighter. 

"Good. Do you think you can kick-start it?" 

"If I move my foot, I will fall over," I told him through gritted teeth, my fingers tight around 
my live grenade. 

"Okay, I'll do it. Don't let go of the clutch." 

He took a step back, and then suddenly slammed his foot down on the pedal. There was a 
short ripping noise, and the force of his thrust rocked the bike. I started to fall sideways, but 
Jake caught the bike before it knocked me to the ground. 

"Steady there," he encouraged. "Do you still have the clutch?" 

"Yes," I gasped. 

"Plant your /m-I'm going to try again." But he put his hand on the back of the seat, too, just 
to be safe. 

It took four more kicks before the ignition caught. I could feel the bike rumbling beneath me 
l ik e an angry animal. I gripped the clutch until my fingers ached. 

"Try out the throttle," he suggested. "Very lightly. And don't let go of the clutch." 

Hesitantly, I twisted the right handle. Though the movement was tiny, the bike snarled 
beneath me. It sounded angry and hungry now. Jacob smiled in deep satisfaction. 

"Do you remember how to put it into first gear?" he asked. 

"Yes." 

"Well, go ahead and do it." 

"Okay." 

He waited for a few seconds. 




"Left foot," he prompted. 

"I know," I said, taking a deep breath. 

"Are you sure you want to do this?" Jacob asked. "You look scared." 

"I'm fine," I snapped. I kicked the gearshift down one notch. 

"Very good," he praised me. "Now, very gently, ease up on the clutch." 

He took a step away from the bike. 

"You want me to let go of the grenade?" I asked in disbelief. No wonder he was moving 
back. 

"That's how you move, Bella. Just do it little by little." 

As I began to loosen my grip, I was shocked to be interrupted by a voice that did not belong 
to the boy standing next to me. 

"This is reckless and childish and idiotic, Bella," the velvet voice fumed. 

"Oh!" I gasped, and my hand fell off the clutch. 

The bike bucked under me, yanking me forward and then collapsing to the ground half on 
top of me. The growling engine choked to a stop. 

"Bella?" Jacob jerked the heavy bike off me with ease. "Are you hurt?" 

But I wasn't listening. 

"I told you so," the perfect voice murmured, crystal clear. 

"Bella?" Jacob shook my shoulder. 

"I'm fine," I mumbled, dazed. 

More than fine. The voice in my head was back. It still rang in my ears-soft, velvety echoes. 

My mind ran swiftly through the possibilities. There was no familiarity here-on a road I'd 
never seen, doing something I'd never done before-no deja vu So the hallucinations must be 
triggered by something else... I felt the adrenaline coursing through my veins again, and I 
thought I had the answer. Some combination of adrenaline and danger, or maybe just 
stupidity. 

Jacob was pulling me to my feet. 

"Did you hit your head?" he asked. 




"I don't think so." I shook it back and forth, checking. "I didn't hurt the bike, did I?" This 
thought worried me. I was anxious to try again, right away. Being reckless was paying off 
better than I'd thought. Forget cheating. Maybe I'd found a way to generate the 
hallucinations-that was much more important. 

"No. You just stalled the engine," Jacob said, interrupting my quick speculations. "You let go 
of the clutch too fast." 

I nodded. "Let's try again." 

"Are you sure?" Jacob asked. 

"Positive." 

This time I tried to get the kick-start myself. It was complicated; I had to jump a little to slam 
down on the pedal with enough force, and every time I did that, the bike tried to knock me 
over. Jacob's hand hovered over the handlebars, ready to catch me if I needed him. 

It took several good tries, and even more poor tries, before the engine caught and roared to 
life under me. Remembering to hold on to the grenade, I revved the throttle experimentally. 
It snarled at the slightest touch. My smile mirrored Jacob's now. 

"Easy on the clutch," he reminded me. 

"Do you want to kill yourself, then? Is that what this is about?" the other voice spoke again, 
his tone severe. 

I smiled tightly-it was still working-and ignored the questions. Jacob wasn't going to let 
anything serious happen to me. 

"Go home to Charlie," the voice ordered. The sheer beauty of it amazed me. I couldn't allow 
my memory to lose it, no matter the price. 

"Ease off slowly," Jacob encouraged me. 

"I will," I said. It bothered me a bit when I realized I was answering both of them. 

The voice in my head growled against the roar of the motorcycle. 

Trying to focus this time, to not let the voice startle me again, I relaxed my hand by tiny 
degrees. Suddenly, the gear caught and wrenched me forward. 

And I was flying. 

There was wind that wasn't there before, blowing my skin against my skull and flinging my 
hair back behind me with enough force that it felt l ik e someone was tugging on it. I'd left my 
stomach back at the starting point; the adrenaline coursed through my body, tingling in my 




veins. The trees raced past me, blurring into a wall of green. 

But this was only first gear. My foot itched toward the gearshift as I twisted for more gas. 

"No, Bella!" the angry, honey-sweet voice ordered in my ear. "Watch what you're doing!" 

It distracted me enough from the speed to realize that the road was starting a slow curve to 
the left, and I was still going straight. Jacob hadn't told me how to turn. 

"Brakes, brakes," I muttered to myself, and I instinctively slammed down with my right foot, 
l ik e I would in my truck. 

The bike was suddenly unstable underneath me, shivering first to one side and then the other. 
It was dragging me toward the green wall, and I was going too fast. I tried to turn the 
handlebar the other direction, and the sudden shift of my weight pushed the bike toward the 
ground, still spinning toward the trees. 

The motorcycle landed on top of me again, roaring loudly, pulling me across the wet sand 
until it hit something stationary. I couldn't see. My face was mashed into the moss. I tried to 
lift my head, but there was something in the way. 

I was dizzy and confused. It sounded l ik e there were three things snarling-the bike over me, 
the voice in my head, and something else. . . 

"Bella!" Jacob yelled, and I heard the roar of the other bike cut off. 

The motorcycle no longer pinned me to the ground, and I rolled over to breathe. All the 
growling went silent. 

"Wow," I murmured. I was thrilled. This had to be it, the recipe for a 
hallucination-adrenaline plus clanger plus stupidity. Something close to that, anyway. 

"Bella!" Jacob was crouching over me anxiously. "Bella, are you alive?" 

"I'm great!" I enthused. I flexed my arms and legs. Everything seemed to be working 
correctly. "Let's do it again." 

"I don't think so." Jacob still sounded worried. "I think I'd better drive you to the hospital 
first." 

"I'm fine." 

"Urn, Bella? You've got a huge cut on your forehead, and it's gushing blood," he informed 
me. 



I clapped my hand over my head. Sure enough, it was wet and sticky. I could smell nothing 
but the damp moss on my face, and that held off the nausea. 




"Oh, I'm so sorry, Jacob." I pushed hard against the gash, as if I could force the blood back 
inside my head. 

"Why are you apologizing for bleeding?" he wondered as he wrapped a long arm around my 
waist and pulled me to my feet. "Let's go. I'll drive." He held out his hand for the keys. 

"What about the bikes?" I asked, handing them over. 

He thought for a second. "Wait here. And take this." He pulled off his T-shirt, already 
spotted with blood, and threw it to me. I wadded it up and held it tightly to my forehead. I 
was starting to smell the blood; I breathed deeply through my mouth and tried to concentrate 
on something else. 

Jacob jumped on the black motorcycle, kicked it to a start in one try, and raced back down 
the road, spraying sand and pebbles behind him. He looked athletic and professional as he 
leaned over the handlebars, head low, face forward, his shiny hair whipping against the russet 
s ki n of his back. My eyes narrowed enviously. I was sure I hadn't looked l ik e that on my 
motorcycle. 

I was surprised at how far I'd gone. I could barely see Jacob in the distance when he finally 
got to the truck. He threw the bike into the bed and sprinted to the driver's side. 

I really didn't feel bad at all as he coaxed my truck to a deafening roar in his hurry to get back 
to me. My head stung a little, and my stomach was uneasy, but the cut wasn't serious. Head 
wounds just bled more than most. His urgency wasn't necessary. 

Jacob left the truck running as he raced back to me, wrapping his arm around my waist again. 
"Okay, let's get you in the truck." 

"I'm honestly fine," I assured him as he helped me in. "Don't get worked up. It's just a little 
blood." 

"Just a lot of blood," I heard him mutter as he went back for my bike. 

"Now, let's think about this for a second," I began when he got back in. "If you take me to 
the ER like this, Charlie is sure to hear about it." I glanced down at the sand and dirt caked 
into my jeans. 

"Bella, I think you need stitches. I'm not going to let you bleed to death." 

"I won't," I promised. "Let's just take the bikes back first, and then we'll make a stop at my 
house so I can dispose of the evidence before we go to the hospital." 

"What about Charlie?" 



He said he had to work today. 




"Are you really sure?" 

"Trust me. I'm an easy bleeder. It's not nearly as dire as it looks." 

Jacob wasn't happy-his full mouth turned down in an uncharacteristic frown-but he didn't 
want to get me in trouble. I stared out the window, holding his ruined shirt to my head, while 
he drove me to Forks. 

The motorcycle was better than I'd dreamed. It had served its original purpose. I'd 
cheated-broken my promise. I'd been needlessly reckless. I felt a little less pathetic now that 
the promises had been broken on both sides. 

And then to discover the key to the hallucinations! At least, I hoped I had. I was going to test 
the theory as soon as possible. Maybe they'd get through with me quickly in the ER, and I 
could try again tonight. 

Racing down the road l ik e that had been amazing. The feel of the wind in my face, the speed 
and the freedom. . . it reminded me of a past life, flying through the thick forest without a 
road, piggyback while he ran-I stopped thinking right there, letting the memory break off in 
the sudden agony. I flinched. 

"You still okay?" Jacob checked. 

"Yeah." I tried to sound as convincing as before. 

"By the way," he added. "I'm going to disconnect your foot brake tonight." 

At home, I went to look at myself in the mirror first thing; it was pretty gruesome. Blood was 
drying in thick streaks across my cheek and neck, matting in my muddy hair. I examined 
myself clinically, pretending the blood was paint so it wouldn't upset my stomach. I breathed 
through my mouth, and was fine. 

I washed up as well as I could. Then I hid my dirty, bloody clothes in the bottom of my 
laundry basket, putting on new jeans and a button-up shirt (that I didn't have to pull over my 
head) as carefully as I could. I managed to do this one-handed and keep both garments 
blood-free. 

"Hurry up," Jacob called. 

"Okay, okay," I shouted back. After making sure I left nothing incriminating behind me, I 
headed downstairs. 

"How do I look?" I asked him. 

"Better," he admitted. 

"But do I look like I tripped in your garage and hit my head on a hammer?" 




"Sure, I guess so." 

"Let's go then." 

Jacob hurried me out the door, and insisted on driving again. We were halfway to the 
hospital when I realized he was still shirtless. 

I frowned guiltily. "We should have grabbed you a jacket." 

"That would have given us away," he teased. "Besides, it's not cold." 

"Are you kidding?" I shivered and reached out to turn the heat on. 

I watched Jacob to see if he was just playing tough so I wouldn't worry, but he looked 
comfortable enough. He had one arm over the back of my seat, though I was huddled up to 
keep warm. 

Jacob really did look older than sixteen-not quite forty, but maybe older than me. Quil didn't 
have too much on him in the muscle department, for all that Jacob claimed to be a skeleton. 
The muscles were the long wiry kind, but they were definitely there under the smooth s ki n. 
His skin was such a pretty color, it made me jealous. 

Jacob noticed my scrutiny. 

"What?" he asked, suddenly self-conscious. 

"Nothing. I just hadn't realized before. Did you know, you're sort of beautiful?" 

Once the words slipped out, I worried that he might take my impulsive observation the 
wrong way. 

But Jacob just rolled his eyes. "You hit your head pretty hard, didn't you?" 

"I'm serious." 

"Well, then, thanks. Sort of." 

I grinned. "You're sort of welcome." 

I had to have seven stitches to c lose the cut on my forehead. After the sting of the local 
anesthetic, there was no pain in the procedure. Jacob held my hand while Dr. Snow was 
sewing, and I tried not to think about why that was ironic. 

We were at the hospital forever. By the time I was done, I had to drop Jacob off at his home 
and hurry back to cook dinner for Charlie. Charlie seemed to buy my story about falling in 
Jacob's garage. After all, it wasn't l ik e I hadn't been able to land myself in the ER before with 
no more help than my own feet. 




This night was not as bad as that first night, after I'd heard the perfect voice in Port Angeles. 
The hole came back, the way it always did when I was away from Jacob, but it didn't throb 
so badly around the edges. I was already planning ahead, looking forward to more delusions, 
and that was a distraction. Also, I knew I would feel better tomorrow when I was with Jacob 
again. That made the empty hole and the fa mil iar pain easier to bear; relief was in sight. The 
nightmare, too, had lost a little of its potency. I was horrified by the nothingness, as always, 
but I was also strangely impatient as I waited for the moment that would send me screaming 
into consciousness. I knew the nightmare had to end. 

The next Wednesday, before I could get home from the ER, Dr. Gerandy called to warn my 
father that I might possibly have a concussion and advised h im to wake me up every two 
hours through the night to make sure it wasn't serious. Charlie's eyes narrowed suspiciously 
at my weak explanation about tripping again. 

"Maybe you should just stay out of the garage altogether, Bella," he suggested that night 
during dinner. 

I panicked, worried that Charlie was about to lay down some kind of edict that would 
prohibit La Push, and consequently my motorcycle. And I wasn't giving it up-I'd had the 
most amazing hallucination today. My velvet- voiced delusion had yelled at me for almost five 
minutes before I'd hit the brake too abruptly and launched myself into the tree. I'd take 
whatever pain that would cause me tonight without complaint. 

"This didn't happen in the garage," I protested quickly. "We were hiking, and I tripped over a 
rock." 

"Since when do you hike?" Charlie asked skeptically. 

"Working at Newton's was bound to rub off sometime," I pointed out. "Spend every day 
selling all the virtues of the outdoors, eventually you get curious." 

Charlie glared at me, unconvinced. 

"I'll be more careful," I promised, surreptitiously crossing my fingers under the table. 

"I don't mind you hiking right there around La Push, but keep close to town, okay?" 

"Why?" 

"Well, we've been getting a lot of wildlife complaints lately. The forestry department is going 
to check into it, but for the time being. . ." 

"Oh, the big bear," I said with sudden comprehension. "Yeah, some of the h ik ers coming 
through Newton's have seen it. Do you think there's really some giant mutated grizzly out 
there?" 

His forehead creased. "There's something. Keep it close to town, okay?" 




"Sure, sure," I said quickly. He didn't look completely appeased. 

"Charlie's getting nosy," I complained to Jacob when I picked him up after school Friday. 

"Maybe we should cool it with the bikes." He saw my objecting expression and added, "At 
least for a week or so. You could stay out of the hospital for a week, right?" 

"What are we going to do?" I griped. 

He smiled cheerfully. "What ever you want." 

I thought about that for a minute-about what I wanted. 

I hated the idea of losing even my brief seconds of closeness with the memories that didn't 
hurt-the ones that came on their own, without me thinking of them consciously. If I couldn't 
have the bikes, I was going to have to find some other avenue to the danger and the 
adrenaline, and that was going to take serious thought and creativity. Doing nothing in the 
meantime was not appealing. Suppose I got depressed again, even with Jake? I had to keep 
occupied. 

Maybe there was some other way, some other recipe. . . some other place. 

The house had been a mistake, certainly. But his presence must be stamped somewhere, 
somewhere other than inside me. There had to be a place where he seemed more real than 
among all the fa mili ar landmarks that were crowded with other human memories. 

I could think of one place where that might hold true. One place that would always belong to 
him and no one else. A magic place, full of light. The beautiful meadow I'd seen only once in 
my life, lit by sunshine and the sparkle of his s ki n. 

This idea had a huge potential for backfiring-it might be dangerously painful. My chest 
ached with emptiness even to think of it. It was hard to hold myself upright, to not give 
myself away. But surely, there of all places, I could hear his voice. And I'd already told 
Charlie I was hiking. . . 

"What are you thinking about so hard?" Jacob asked. 

"Well..." I began slowly. "I found this place in the forest once-I came across it when I was, 
um, hiking. A little meadow, the most beautiful place. I don't know if I could track it down 
again on my own. It would definitely take a few tries. . . " 

"We could use a compass and a grid pattern," Jacob said with confident helpfulness. "Do you 
know where you started from?" 

"Yes, just below the trailhead where the one-ten ends. I was going mostly south, I think." 
"Cool. We'll find it." As always, Jacob was game for anything I wanted. No matter how 




strange it was. 



So, Saturday afternoon, I tied on my new hiking boots-purchased that morning using my 
twenty-per-cent-off employee discount for the first time-grabbed my new topographical map 
of the Olympic Peninsula, and drove to La Push. 

We didn't get started immediately; first, Jacob sprawled across the living room floor-taking 
up the whole room-and, for a full twenty minutes, drew a complicated web across the key 
section of the map while I perched on a kitchen chair and talked to Billy. Billy didn't seem at 
all concerned about our proposed hiking trip. I was surprised that Jacob had told him where 
we were going, given the fuss people were making about the bear sightings. I wanted to ask 
Billy not to say anything about this to Charlie, but I was afraid that making the request 
would cause the opposite result. 

"Maybe we'll see the super bear," Jacob joked, eyes on his design. 

I glanced at Billy swiftly, fearing a Charlie-style reaction. 

But Billy just laughed at his son. "Maybe you should take a jar of honey, just in case." 

Jake chuckled. "Hope your new boots are fast, Bella. One little jar isn't going to keep a 
hungry bear occupied for long." 

"I only have to be faster than you." 

"Good luck with that!" Jacob said, rolling his eyes as he refolded the map. "Let's go." 

"Have fun," Billy rumbled, wheeling himself toward the refrigerator. 

Charlie was not a hard person to live with, but it looked to me l ik e Jacob had it even easier 
than I did. 

I drove to the very end of the dirt road, stopping near the sign that marked the beginning of 
the trailhead. It had been a long time since I'd been here, and my stomach reacted nervously. 
This might be a very bad thing. But it would be worth it, if I got to hear him. 

I got out and looked at the dense wall of green. 

"I went this way," I murmured, pointing straight ahead. 

"Hmm," Jake muttered. 

"What?" 

He looked at the direction I'd pointed, then at the clearly marked trail, and back. 

"I would have figured you for a trail kind of girl." 




"Not me." I smiled bleakly. "I'm a rebel." 

He laughed, and then pulled out our map. 

"Give me a second." He held the compass in a s ki lled way, twisting the map around till it 
angled the way he wanted. 

"Okay-first line on the grid. Let's do it." 

I could tell that I was slowing Jacob up, but he didn't complain. I tried not to dwell on my 
last trip through this part of the forest, with a very different companion. Normal memories 
were still cangerous. If I let myself slip up, I'd end up with my arms clutching my chest to 
hold it together, gasping for air, and how would I explain that to Jacob? 

It wasn't as hard as I would have thought to keep focused on the present. The forest looked a 
lot l ik e any other part of the peninsula, and Jacob set a vastly different mood. 

He whistled cheerfully, an unfamiliar tune, swinging his arms and moving easily through the 
rough undergrowth. The shadows didn't seem as dark as usual. Not with my personal sun 
along. 

Jacob checked the compass every few minutes, keeping us in a straight line with one of the 
radiating spokes of his grid. He really looked l ik e he knew what he was doing. I was going to 
compliment him, but I caught myself. No doubt he'd add another few years to his inflated 
age. 

My mind wandered as I walked, and I grew curious. I hadn't forgotten the conversation we'd 
had by the sea cliffs— I'd been waiting for him to bring it up again, but it didn't look l ik e that 
was going to happen. 

"Hey . . . Jake?" I asked hesitantly. 

"Yeah?" 

"How are things. . . with Embry? Is he back to normal yet?" 

Jacob was silent for a minute, still moving forward with long paces. When he was about ten 
feet ahead, he stopped to wait for me. 

"No. He's not back to normal," Jacob said when I reached him, his mouth pulling down at 
the comers. He didn't start walking again. I immediately regretted bringing it up. 

"Still with Sam." 

"Yup." 

He put his arm around my shoulder, and he looked so troubled that I didn't playfully shake it 




off, as I might have otherwise. 

"Are they still looking at you funny?" I half- whispered. 

Jacob stared through the trees. "Sometimes." 

"And Billy?" 

"As helpful as ever," he said in a sour, angry voice that disturbed me. 

"Our couch is always open," I offered. 

He laughed, breaking out of the unnatural gloom. "But think of the position that would put 
Charlie in-when Billy calls the police to report my kidnapping." 

I laughed too, glad to have Jacob back to normal. 

We stopped when Jacob said we'd gone six miles, cut west for a short time, and headed back 
along another line of his grid. Everything looked exactly the same as the way in, and I had a 
feeling that my silly quest was pretty much doomed. I admitted as much when it started to 
get darker, the sunless day fading toward a starless night, but Jacob was more confident. 

"As long as you're sure we're starting from the right place. . . " He glanced down at me. 

"Yes, I'm sure." 

"Then we'll find it," he promised, grabbing my hand and pulling me through a mass of ferns. 
On the other side was the truck. He gestured toward it proudly. "Trust me." 

"You're good," I admitted. "Next time we bring flashlights, though." 

"We'll save hiking for Sundays from now on. I didn't know you were that slow." 

I yanked my hand back and stomped around to the driver's side while he chuckled at my 
reaction. 

"So you up for another try tomorrow.'" he asked, sliding into the passenger seat. 

"Sure. Unless you want to go without me so I don't tie you down to my gimpy pace." 

"I'll survive," he assured me. "If we're hiking again, though, you might want to pick up some 
moleskin. I bet you can feel those new boots right now." 

"A little," I confessed. It felt l ik e I had more blisters than I had space to fit them. 

"I hope we see the bear tomorrow. I'm sort of disappointed about that." 

"Yes, me, too," I agreed sarcastically. "Maybe we'll get lucky tomorrow and something will 
eat us!" 




"Bears don't want to eat people. We don't taste that good." He grinned at me in the dark cab. 
"Of course, you might be an exception. I bet you'd taste good." 

"Thanks so much," I said, looking away. He wasn't the first person to tell me that. 




9. THIRD WHEEL 



TIME BEGAN TO TRIP ALONG MUCH MORE QUICKLY than before. School, work, 
and Jacob-though not necessarily in that order-created a neat and effortless pattern to 
follow. And Charlie got his wish: I wasn't miserable anymore. Of course, I couldn't fool 
myself completely. When I stopped to take stock of my life, which I tried not to do too often, 
I couldn't ignore the implications of my behavior. 

I was like a lost moon-my planet destroyed in some cataclysmic, disaster-movie scenario of 
desolation-that continued, nevertheless, to circle in a tight little orbit around the empty space 
left behind, ignoring the laws of gravity. 

I was getting better with my bike, which meant fewer bandages to worry Charlie. But it also 
meant that the voice in my head began to fade, until I heard it no more. Quietly, I panicked. I 
threw myself into the search for the meadow with slightly frenzied intensity. I racked my 
brain for other adrenaline-producing activities. 

I didn't keep track of the days :hat passed-there was no reason, as I tried to live as much in 
the present as possible, no past fading, no future impending. So I was surprised by the date 
when Jacob brought it up on one of our homework days. He was waiting when I pulled up in 
front of his house. 

"Happy Valentine's Day," Jacob said, smiling, but ducking his head as he greeted me. 

He held out a small, pink box, balancing it on his palm. Conversation hearts. 

"Well, I feel like a schmuck," I mumbled. "Is today Valentine's Day?" 

Jacob shook his head with mock sadness. "You can be so out of it sometimes. Yes, it is the 
fourteenth day of February. So are you going to be my Valentine? Since you didn't get me a 
fifty-cent box of candy, it's the least you can do." 

I started to feel uncomfortable. The words were teasing, but only on the surface. 

"What exactly does that entail?" I hedged. 

"The usual-slave for life, that kind of thing." 

"Oh, well, if that's all. . ." I took the candy. But I was trying to think of some way to make the 
boundaries clear. Again. They seemed to get blurred a lot with Jacob. 

"So, what are we doing tomorrow? Hiking, or the ER?" 

"Hiking," I decided. "You're not the only one who can be obsessive. I'm starting to think I 
imagined that place. . . " I frowned into space. 

"We'll find it," he assured me. "Bikes Friday?" he offered. 




I saw a chance and took it without taking time to think it through. 



"I'm going to a movie Friday. I've been promising my cafeteria crowd that I would go out 
forever." Mike would be pleased. 

But Jacob's face fell. I caught the expression in his dark eyes before he dropped them to look 
at the ground. 

"You'll come too, right?" I added quickly. "Or will it be too much of a drag with a bunch of 
boring seniors?" So much for my chance to put some distance between us. I couldn't stand 
hurting Jacob; we seemed to be connected in an odd way, and his pain set off little stabs of 
my own. Also, the idea of having his company for the ordeal-I had promised Mike, but really 
didn't feel any enthusiasm at the thought of following through-was just too tempting. 

"You'd like me to come, with your friends there?" 

"Yes," I admitted honestly, knowing as I continued that I was probably shooting myself in 
the foot with my words. "I'll have a lot more fun if you're there. Bring Quil, and we'll make it 
a party." 

"Quil's gonna freak. Senior girls." He chortled and rolled his eyes. I didn't mention Embry, 
and neither did he. I laughed, too. "I'll try to get hin a good selection." 

I broached the subject with Mike in English. 

"Hey, Mike," I said when class was over. "Are you free Friday night?" 

He looked up, his blue eyes instantly hopeful. "Yeah, I am. You want to go out?" 

I worded my reply carefully. "I was thinking about getting a group "- 1 emphasized the 
word-" together to go see Crosshairs." I'd done my homework this time-even reading the 
movie spoilers to be sure I wouldn't be caught off guard. This movie was supposed to be a 
bloodbath from start to finish. I wasn't so recovered that I could stand to sit through a 
romance. "Does that sound l ik e fun?" 

"Sure," he agreed, visibly less eager. 

"Cool." 

After a second, he perked back up to near his former excitement level. "How about we get 
Angela and Ben? Or Eric and Katie?" 

He was determined to make this some kind of double date, apparently. 

"How about both?" I suggested "And Jessica, too, of course. And Tyler and Conner, and 
maybe Lauren," I tacked on grudgingly. I had promised Quil variety. 




Okay," Mike muttered, foiled. 



"And," I continued, "I've got a couple of friends from La Push I'm inviting. So it sounds l ik e 
we'll need your Suburban if everyone comes." 

Mike's eyes narrowed in suspicion. 

"These are the friends you spend all your time studying with now?" 

"Yep, the very ones," I answered cheerfully. "Though you could look at it as tutoring-they're 
only sophomores." 

"Oh," Mike said, surprised. After a second of thought, he smiled. 

In the end, though, the Suburban wasn't necessary. 

Jessica and Lauren claimed to be busy as soon as Mike let it slip that I was involved in the 
planning. Eric and Katie already had plans-it was their three-week anniversary or something. 
Lauren got to Tyler and Conner before Mike could, so those two were also busy. Even Quil 
was out-grounded for fighting at school. In the end, only Angela and Ben, and, of course 
Jacob, were able to go. 

The diminished numbers didn't dampen Mike's anticipation, though. It was all he could talk 
about Friday. 

"Are you sure you don't want to see Tomorrow and Forever instead?" he asked at lunch, 
naming the current romantic comedy that was ruling the box office. "Rotten Tomatoes gave 
it a better review." 

"I want to see Crosshairs" I insisted. "I'm in the mood for action. Bring on the blood and 
guts!" 

"Okay." Mike turned away, but not before I saw his maybe-she's-crazy-after-all expression. 

When I got home from school, a very fa mili ar car was parked in front of my house. Jacob was 
leaning against the hood, a huge grin lighting up his face. 

"No way!" I shouted as I jumped out of the truck. "You're done! I can't believe it! You 
finished the Rabbit!" 

He beamed. "Just last night. This is the maiden voyage." 

"Incredible." I held my hand up for a high five. 

He smacked his hand against mine, but left it there, twisting his fingers through mine. "So do 
I get to drive tonight?" 

"Definitely," I said, and then I sighed. 




'What's wrong? 



"I'm giving up-I can't top this one. So you win. You're oldest." 

He shrugged, unsurprised by my capitulation. "Of course I am." 

Mike's Suburban chugged around the comer. I pulled my hand out of Jacob's, and he nude a 
face that I wasn't meant to see. 

"I remember this guy," he said in a low voice as Mike parked across the street. "The one who 
thought you were his girlfriend. Is he still confused?" 

I raised one eyebrow. "Some people are hard to discourage." 

"Then again," Jacob said thoughtfully, "sometimes persistence pays off." 

"Most of the time it's just annoying, though." 

Mike got out of his car and crossed the road. 

"Hey, Bella," he greeted me, and then his eyes turned wary as he looked up at Jacob. I 
glanced briefly at Jacob, too, trying to be objective. He really didn't look l ik e a sophomore at 
all. He was just so big-Mike's head barely cleared Jacob's shoulder; I didn't even want to 
think where I measured next to him-and then his face was older-looking than it used to be, 
even a month ago. 

"Hey, Mike! Do you remember Jacob Black?" 

"Not really." Mike held out his hand. 

"Old family friend," Jacob introduced himself, shaking hands. They locked hands with more 
force than necessary. When their grip broke, Mike flexed his fingers. 

I heard the phone ringing from the kitchen. 

"I'd better get that-it might be Charlie," I told them, and dashed inside. 

It was Ben. Angela was sick with the stomach flu, and he didn't feel l ik e coming without her. 
He apologized for bailing on us. 

I walked slowly back to the waiting boys, shaking my head. I really hoped Angela would feel 
better soon, but I had to admit that I was selfishly upset by this development. Just the three 
of us, Mike and Jacob and me, together for the evening-this had worked out brilliantly, I 
thought with grim sarcasm. 

It didn't seem like Jake and Mike had made any progress towards friendship in my absence. 
They were several yards apart, facing away from each other as they waited for me; Mike's 
expression was sullen, though Jacob's was cheerful as always. 




"Ang is sick," I told them glumly. "She and Ben aren't coming." 

"I guess the flu is making another round. Austin and Conner were out today, too. Maybe we 
should do this another time," Mike suggested. 

Before I could agree, Jacob spoke. 

"I'm still up for it. But if you'd rather to stay behind, Mike-" 

"No, I'm coming," Mike interrupted. "I was just thinking of Angela and Ben. Let's go." He 
started toward his Suburban. 

"Hey, do you mind if Jacob drives?" I asked. "I told him he could-he just finished his car. He 
built it from scratch, all by himself," I bragged, proud as a PTA mom with a student on the 
principal's list. 

"Fine," Mike snapped. 

"All right, then," Jacob said, as if that settled everything. He seemed more comfortable than 
anyone else. 

Mike climbed in the backseat of the Rabbit with a disgusted expression. 

Jacob was his normal sunny self, chattering away until I'd all but forgotten Mike sulking 
silently in the back. 

And then Mike changed his strategy. He leaned forward, resting his chin on the shoulder of 
my seat; his cheek almost touched mine. I shifted away, turning my back toward the window. 

"Doesn't the radio work in this thing?" Mike asked with a hint of petulance, interrupting 
Jacob mid-sentence. 

"Yes," Jacob answered. "But Bella doesn't like music." 

I stared at Jacob, surprised. I'd never told him that. 

"Bella?" Mike asked, annoyed. 

"He's right," I mumbled, still looking at Jacob's serene profile. 

"How can you not like music?" Mike demanded. 

I shrugged. "I don't know. It just irritates me." 

"Hmph." Mike leaned away. 

When we got to the theater, Jacob handed me a ten-dollar bill. 




'What's this?" I objected. 



"I'm not old enough to get into this one," he reminded me. 

I laughed out loud. "So much for relative ages. Is Billy going to kill me if I sneak you in?" 

"No. I told him you were planning to corrupt my youthful innocence." 

I snickered, and Mike quickened his pace to keep up with us. 

I almost wished that Mike had decided to bow out. He was still sullen-not much of an 
addition to the party. But I didn't want to end up on a date alone with Jacob, either. That 
wouldn't help anything. 

The movie was exactly what it professed to be. In just the opening credits, four people got 
blown up and one got beheaded. The girl in front of me put her hands over her eyes and 
turned her face into her date's chest. He patted her shoulder, and winced occasionally, too. 
Mike didn't look l ik e he was watching. His face was stiff as he glared toward the fringe of 
curtain above the screen. 

I settled in to endure the two hours, watching the colors and the movement on the screen 
rather than seeing the shapes of people and cars and houses. But then Jacob started 
sniggering. 

"What?" I whispered. 

"Oh, c'mon!" he hissed back. "The blood squirted twenty feet out of that guy. How fake can 
you get?" 

He chuckled again, as a flagpole speared another man into a concrete wall. 

After that, I really watched the show, laughing with him as the mayhem got more and more 
ridiculous. How was I ever going to fight the blurring lines in our relationship when I 
enjoyed being with him so much? 

Both Jacob and Mike had claimed the armrests on either side of me. Both of their hands 
rested lightly, palms up, in an unnatural looking position. Like steel bear traps, open and 
ready. Jacob was in the habit of taking my hand whenever the opportunity presented itself, 
but here in the darkened movie theater, with Mike watching, it would have a different 
significance-and I was sure he knew that. I couldn't believe that Mike was thinking the same 
thing, but his hand was placed exactly like Jacob's. 

I folded my arms tightly across my chest and hoped that both their hands fell asleep. 

Mike gave up first. About halfway through the movie, he pulled his arm back, and leaned 
forward to put his head in his hands. At first I thought he was reacting to something on the 
screen, but then he moaned. 




"Mike, are you okay?" I whispered. 

The couple in front of us turned to look at him as he groaned again. 

I could see the sheen of sweat across his face in the light from the screen. 

Mike groaned again, and bolted for the door. I got up to follow him, and Jacob copied me 
immediately. 

"No, stay," I whispered. "I'll make sure he's okay." 

Jacob came with me anyway. 

"You don't have to come. Get your eight bucks worth of carnage," I insisted as we walked 
up the aisle. 

"That's okay. You sure can pick them, Bella. This movie really sucks." His voice rose from a 
whisper to its normal pitch as we walked out of the theater. 

There was no sign of Mike in the hallway, and I was glad then that Jacob had come with 
me-he ducked into the men's bathroom to check for him there. 

Jacob was back in a few seconds. 

"Oh, he's in there, all right," he said, rolling his eyes. "What a marshmallow. You should hold 
out for someone with a stronger stomach. Someone who laughs at the gore that makes 
weaker men vomit." 

"I'll keep my eyes open for someone like that." 

We were all alone in the hallway. Both theaters were halfway through the movie, and it was 
deserted-quiet enough for us to hear the popcorn popping at the concession counter in the 
lobby. 

Jacob went to sit on the velveteen-upholstered bench against the wall, patting the space 
beside him. 

"He sounded like he was going to be in there for a while," he said, stretching his long legs 
out in front of him as he settled in to wait. 

I joined him with a sigh. He looked l ik e he was thinking about blurring more lines. Sure 
enough, as soon as I sat down, he shifted over to put his arm around my shoulders. 

"Jake," I protested, leaning away. He dropped his arm, not looking bothered at all by the 
minor rejection. He reached out and took my hand firmly, wrapping his other hand around 
my wrist when I tried to pull away again. Where did he get the confidence from? 



Now, just hold on a minute, Bella," he said in a calm voice. "Tell me something. 




I grimaced. I didn't want to do this. Not just not now, but not ever. There was nothing lett in 
my life at this point that was more important than Jacob Black. But he seemed determined to 
min everything. 

"What?" I muttered sourly. 

"You l ik e me, right?" 

"You know I do." 

"Better than that joker puking his guts out in there?" He gestured toward the bathroom door. 
"Yes," I sighed. 

"Better than any of the other guys you know?" He was calm, serene-as if my answer didn't 
matter, or he already knew what it was. 

"Better than the girls, too," I pointed out. 

"But that's all," he said, and it wasn't a question. 

It was hard to answer, to say the word. Would he get hurt and avoid me? How would I stand 
that? 

"Yes," I whispered. 

He grinned down at me. "That's okay, you know. As long as you like me the best. And you 
think I'm good-looking-sort of. I'm prepared to be annoyingly persistent." 

"I'm not going to change," I said, and though I tried to keep my voice normal, I could hear 
the sadness in it. 

His face was thoughtful, no longer teasing. "It's still the other one, isn't it?" 

I cringed. Funny how he seemed to know not to say the name-just l ik e before in the car with 
the music. He picked up on so much about me that I never said. 

"You don't have to talk about it," he told me. 

I nodded, grateful. 

"But don't get mad at me for hanging around, okay?" Jacob patted the back of my hand. 
"Because I'm not giving up. I've got loads of time." 

I sighed. "You shouldn't waste it on me," I said, though I wanted him to. Especially if he was 
willing to accept me the way I was-damaged goods, as is. 

"It's what I want to do, as long as you still like to be with me." 




"I can't imagine how I could not like being with you," I told him honestly. 

Jacob beamed. "I can live with that." 

"Just don't expect more," I warned him, trying to pull my hand away. He held onto it 
obstinately. 

"This doesn't really bother you, does it?" he demanded, squeezing my fingers. 

"No," I sighed. Truthfully, it felt nice. His hand was so much warmer than mine; I always felt 
too cold these days. 

"And you don't care what he thinks." Jacob jerked his thumb toward the bathroom. 

"I guess not." 

"So what's the problem?" 

"The problem," I said, "is, that it means something different to me than it does to you." 

"Well." He tightened his hand around mine "That's my problem, isn't it?" 

"Fine," I grumbled. "Don't forget it, though." 

"I won't. The pin's out of the grenade for me, now, eh?" He poked me in the ribs. 

I rolled my eyes. I guess if he felt like making a joke out of it, he was entitled. 

He chuckled quietly for a minute while his pinky finger absently traced designs against the 
side of my hand. 

"That's a funny scar you've got there," he suddenly said, twisting my hand to examine it. 
"How did that happen?" 

The index finger of his free hand followed the line of the long silvery crescent that was barely 
visible against my pale skin. 

I scowled. "Do you honestly expect me to remember where all my scars come from?" 

I waited for the memory to hit-to open the gaping hole. But, as it so often did, Jacob's 
presence kept me whole. 

"It's cold," he murmured, pressing lightly against the place where James had cut me with his 
teeth. 

And then Mike stumbled out of the bathroom, his face ashen and covered in sweat. He 
looked horrible. 




"Oh, Mike," I gasped. 

"Do you mind leaving early?" he whispered. 

"No, of course not." I pulled my hand free and went to help Mike walk. He looked unsteady. 
"Movie too much for you?" Jacob asked heartlessly. 

Mike's glare was malevolent. "I didn't actually see any of it," he mumbled. "I was nauseated 
before the lights went down." 

"Why didn't you say something?" I scolded as we staggered toward the exit. 

"I was hoping it would pass," he said. 

"Just a sec," Jacob said as we reached the door. He walked quickly back to the concession 
stand. 

"Could I have an empty popcorn bucket?" he asked the salesgirl. She looked at Mike once, 
and then thrust a bucket at Jacob. 

"Get him outside, please," she begged. She was obviously the one who would have to clean 
the floor. 

I towed Mike out into the cool, wet air. He inhaled deeply. Jacob was right behind us. He 
helped me get Mike into the back of the car, and handed him the bucket with a serious gaze. 

"Please," was all Jacob said. 

We rolled down the windows, letting the icy night air blow through the car, hoping it would 
help Mike. I curled my arms around my legs to keep warm. 

"Cold, again?" Jacob asked, putting his arm around me before I could answer. 

"You're not?" 

He shook his head. 

"You must have a fever or something," I grumbled. It was freezing. I touched my fingers to 
his forehead, and his head was hot. 

"Whoa, Jake-you're burning up!" 

"I feel fine." He shrugged. "Fit as a fiddle." 

I frowned and touched his head again. His skin blazed under my fingers. 

"Your hands are l ik e ice," he complained. 




"Maybe it's me," I allowed. 

Mike groaned in the backseat, and threw up in the bucket. I grimaced, hoping my own 
stomach could stand the sound and smell. Jacob checked anxiously over his shoulder to make 
sure his car wasn't defiled. 

The road felt longer on the way back. 

Jacob was quiet, thoughtful. He left his arm around me, and it was so warm that the cold 
wind felt good. 

I stared out the windshield, consumed with guilt. 

It was so wrong to encourage Jacob. Pure selfishness. It didn't matter that I'd tried to make 
my position clear. If he felt any hope at all that this could turn into something other than 
friendship, then I hadn't been clear enough. 

How could I explain so that he would understand? I was an empty shell. Like a vacant 
house-condemned-for months I'd been utterly uninhabitable. Now I was a little improved. 
The front room was in better repair. But that was all-just the one small piece. He deserved 
better than that-better than a one-room, falling-down fixer-upper. No amount of investment 
on his part could put me back in working order. 

Yet I knew that I wouldn't send him away, regardless. I needed him too much, and I was 
selfish. Maybe I could make my side more clear, so that he would know to leave me. The 
thought made me shudder, and Jacob tightened his arm around me. 

I drove Mike home in his Suburban, while Jacob followed behind us to take me home. Jacob 
was quiet all the way back to my house, and I wondered if he were thinking the same things 
that I was. Maybe he was changing his mind. 

"I would invite myself in, since we're early," he said as we pulled up next to my truck. "But I 
think you might be right about the fever. I'm starting to feel a little. . . strange." 

"Oh no, not you, too! Do you want me to drive you home?" 

"No." He shook his head, his eyebrows pulling together. "I don't feel sick yet. Just... wrong. 
If I have to, I'll pull over." 

"Will you call me as soon as you get in?" I asked anxiously. 

"Sure, sure." He frowned, staring ahead into the darkness and biting his lip. 

I opened my door to get out, but he grabbed my wrist lightly and held me there. I noticed 
again how hot his skin felt on mine. 



'What is it, Jake?" I asked. 




"There's something I want to tell you, Bella. . . but I think it's going to sound kind of corny." 

I sighed. This would be more of the same from the theater. "Go ahead." 

"It's just that, I know how you're unhappy a lot. And, maybe it doesn't help anything, but I 
wanted you to know that I'm always here. I won't ever let you down-I promise that you can 
always count on me. Wow, that does sound corny. But you know that, right? That I would 
never, ever hurt you?" 

"Yeah, Jake. I know that. And I already do count on you, probably more than you know." 

The smile broke across his face the way the sunrise set the clouds on fire, and I wanted to cut 
my tongue out. I hadn't said one word that was a lie, but I should have lied. The truth was 
wrong, it would hurt him. I would let h im down. 

A strange look crossed his face. "I really think I'd better go home now," he said. 

I got out quickly. 

"Call me!" I yelled as he pulled away. 

I watched him go, and he seemed to be in control of the car, at least. I stared at the empty 
street when he was gone, feeling a little sick myself, but not for any physical reason. 

How much I wished that Jacob Black had been born my brother, my flesh-and -blood 
brother, so that I would have some legitimate claim on him that still left me free of any blame 
now. Heaven knows I had never wanted to use Jacob, but I couldn't help but interpret the 
guilt I felt now to mean that I had. 

Even more, I had never meant to love him. One thing I truly knew-knew it in the pit of my 
stomach, in the center of my bones, knew it from the crown of my head to the soles of my 
feet, knew it deep in my empty chest-was how love gave someone the power to break you. 

I'd been broken beyond repair. 

But I needed Jacob now, needed him l ik e a drug. I'd used him as a crutch for too long, and I 
was in deeper than I'd planned to go with anyone again. Now I couldn't bear for him to be 
hurt, and I couldn't keep from hurting him, either. He thought time and patience would 
change me, and, though I knew he was dead wrong, I also knew that I would let him try. 

He was my best friend. I would always love him, and it would never, ever be enough. 

I went inside to sit by the phone and bite my nails. 

"Movie over already?" Charlie asked in surprise when I came in. He was on the floor, just a 
foot from the TV. Must be an exciting game. 




"Mike got sick," I explained. "Some kind of stomach flu." 

"You okay?" 

"I feel fine now," I said doubtfully. Clearly, I'd been exposed. 

I leaned against the kitchen counter, my hand inches from the phone, and tried to wait 
patiently. I thought of the strange look on Jacob's face before he drove away, and my fingers 
started drumming against the counter. I should have insisted on driving him home. 

I watched the clock as the minutes ticked by Ten. Fifteen. Even when I was driving, it took 
only fifteen minutes, and Jacob drove faster than I did. Eighteen minutes. I picked up the 
phone and dialed. 

It rang and rang. Maybe Billy was asleep. Maybe I'd dialed wrong. I tried again. 

On the eighth ring, just as I was about to hang up, Billy answered. 

"Hello?" he asked. His voice was wary, like he was expecting bad news. 

"Billy, it's me, Bella-did Jake make it home yet? He left here about twenty minutes ago." 
"He's here," Billy said tonelessly. 

"He was supposed to call me." I was a little irritated. "He was getting sick when he left, and I 
was worried." 

"He was... too sick to call. He's not feeling well right now." Billy sounded distant. I realized 
he must want to be with Jacob. 

"Let me know if you need any help," I offered. "I could come down." I thought of Billy, stuck 
in his chair, and Jake fending for himself. . . 

"No, no," Billy said quickly. "We're fine. Stay at your place." 

The way he said it was almost rude. 

"Okay," I agreed. 

"Bye, Bella." 

The line disconnected. 

"Bye," I muttered. 

Well, at least he'd made it home. Oddly, I didn't feel less worried. I trudged up the stairs, 
fretting. Maybe I would go down before work tomorrow to check on him. I could take 
soup-we had to have a can of Campbell's around here somewhere. 




I realized all such plans were canceled when I woke up early-my clock said four thirty-and 
sprinted to the bathroom. Charlie found me there a half hour later, lying on the floor, my 
cheek pressed against the cold edge of the bathtub. 

He looked at me for a long moment. 

"Stomach flu," he finally said. 

"Yes," I moaned. 

"You need something?" he asked. 

"Call the Newtons for me, please," I instructed hoarsely. "Tell them I have what Mike has, 
and that I can't make it in today. Tell them I'm sorry." 

"Sure, no problem," Charlie assured me. 

I spent the rest of the day on the bathroom floor, sleeping for a few hours with my head on a 
crumpled up towel. Charlie claimed that he had to work, but I suspected that he just wanted 
access to a bathroom. He left a glass of water on the floor beside me to keep me hydrated. 

It woke me up when he came back home. I could see that it was dark in my room-after 
nightfall. He clumped up the stairs to check on me. 

"Still alive?" 

"Sort of," I said. 

"Do you want anything?" 

"No, thanks." 

He hesitated, clearly out of his element. "Okay, then," he said, and then he went back down 
to the kitchen. 

I heard the phone ring a few minutes later. Charlie spoke to someone in a low voice for a 
moment, and then hung up. 

"Mike feels better," he called up to me. 

Well, that was encouraging. He'd only gotten sick eight hours or so before me. Eight more 
hours. The thought made my stomach turn, and I pulled myself up to lean over the toilet. 

I fell asleep on the towel again, but when I woke up I was in my bed and it was light outside 
my window. I didn't remember moving; Charlie must have carried me to my room-he'd also 
put the glass of water on my bedside table. I felt parched. I chugged it down, though it tasted 
funny from sitting stagnant all night. 




I got up slowly, trying not to trigger the nausea again. I was weak, and my mouth tasted 
horrible, but my stomach felt fine. I looked at my clock. 

My twenty-four hours were up. 

I didn't push it, eating nothing but saltine crackers for breakfast. Charlie looked relieved to 
see me recovered. 

As soon as I was sure that I wasn't going to have to spend the day on the bathroom floor 
again, I called Jacob. 

Jacob was the one who answered, but when I heard his greeting I knew he wasn't over it. 
"Hello?" His voice was broken, cracking. 

"Oh, Jake," I groaned sympathetically. "You sound horrible." 

"I feel horrible," he whispered. 

"I'm so sorry I made you go out with me. This sucks." 

"I'm glad I went." His voice was still a whisper. "Don't blame yourself. This isn't your fault." 
"You'll get better soon," I promised. "I woke up this morning, and I was fine." 

"You were sick?" he asked dully. 

"Yes, I got it, too. But I'm fine now." 

"That's good." His voice was dead. 

"So you'll probably be better in a few hours," I encouraged. 

I could barely hear his answer. "I don't think I have the same thing you did." 

"Don't you have the stomach flu?" I asked, confused. 

"No. This is something else." 

"What's wrong with you?" 

"Everything," he whispered. "Every part of me hurts." 

The pain in his voice was nearly tangible. 

"What can I do, Jake? What can I bring you?" 

"Nothing. You can't come here." He was abrupt. It reminded me of Billy the other night. 




"I've already been exposed to whatever you have," I pointed out. 

He ignored me. "I'll call you when I can. I'll let you know when you can come down again." 
"Jacob-" 

"I've got to go," he said with sudden urgency. 

"Call me when you feel better." 

"Right," he agreed, and his voice had a strange, bitter edge. 

He was silent for a moment. I was waiting for him to say goodbye, but he waited too. 

"I'll see you soon," I finally said. "Wait for me to call," he said again. "Okay... Bye, Jacob." 
"Bella," he whispered my name, and then hung up the phone. 




10. THE MEADOW 



JACOB DIDN'T CALL. 

The first time I called, Billy answered and told me that Jacob was still in bed. I got nosy, 
checking to make sure that Billy had taken him to a doctor. Billy said he had, but, for some 
reason I couldn't nail down, I didn't really believe him. I called again, several times a day, for 
the next two days, but no one was ever there. 

Saturday, I decided to go see him, invitation be damned. But the little red house was empty. 
This frightened me-was Jacob so sick that he'd needed to go to the hospital? I stopped by 
the hospital on the way back home, but the nurse at the front desk told me neither Jacob or 
Billy had been in. 

I made Charlie call Harry Clearwater as soon as he got home from work. I waited, anxious, 
while Charlie chatted with his old friend; the conversation seemed to go on forever without 
Jacob even being mentioned. It seemed that Harry had been in the hospital . . some kind of 
tests for his heart. Charlie's forehead got all pinched together, but Harry joked with him, 
blowing it off, until Charlie was laughing again. Only then did Charlie ask about Jacob, and 
now his side of the conversation didn't give me much to work with, just a lot of hmms and 
yeahs. I drummed my fingers against the counter beside him until he put a hand over mine to 
stop me. 

Finally, Charlie hung up the phone and turned to me. 

"Harry says there's been some trouble with the phone lines, and that's why you haven't been 
able to get through. Billy took Jake to the doc down there, and it looks like he has mono. 
He's real tired, and Billy said no visitors," he reported. 

"No visitors?" I demanded in disbelief. 

Charlie raised one eyebrow. "Now don't you go making a pest of yourself. Bells. Billy knows 
what's best for Jake. He'll be up and around soon enough. Be patient." 

I didn't push it. Charlie was too worried about Harry. That was clearly the more important 
issue-it wouldn't be right to bug him with my lesser concerns. Instead, I went straight 
upstairs and turned on my computer. I found a medical site online and typed "mononucleosis" 
into the search box. 

All I knew about mono was that you were supposed to get it from kissing, which was clearly 
not the case with Jake. I read through the symptoms quickly-the fever he definitely had, but 
what about the rest of it? No horrible sore throat, no exhaustion, no headaches, at least not 
before he'd gone home from the movie; he'd said he felt "fit as a fiddle." Did it really come on 
so fast? The article made it sound l ik e the sore stuff showed up first. 

I glared at the computer screen and wondered why, exactly, I was doing this. Why did I feel 




so. . . so suspicious, l ik e I didn't believe Billy's story? Why would Billy lie to Harry? 

I was being silly, probably. I was just worried, and, to be honest, I was afraid of not being 
allowed to see Jacob-that made me nervous. 

I skimmed through the rest of the article, looking for more information. I stopped when I got 
to the part about how mono could last more than a month. 

A month ? My mouth fell open. 

But Billy couldn't enforce the no- visitors thing that long. Of course not. Jake would go crazy 
stuck in bed that long without anyone to talk to. 

What was Billy afraid of, anyway? The article said that a person with mono needed to avoid 
physical activity, but there was nothing about visitors. The disease wasn't very infectious. 

I'd give Billy a week, I decided, before I got pushy. A week was generous. 

A week was long. By Wednesday, I was sure I wasn't going to live till Saturday. 

When I'd decided to leave Billy and Jacob alone for a week, I hadn't really believed that 
Jacob would go along with Billy's rule. Every day when I got home from school, I ran to the 
phone to check for messages. There never were any. 

I cheated three times by trying to call him, but the phone lines still weren't working. 

I was in the house much too much, and much too alone. Without Jacob, and my adrenaline 
and my distractions, everything I'd been repressing started creeping up on me. The dreams 
got hard again. I could no longer see the end coming. Just the horrible nothingness-half the 
time in the forest, half the time in the empty fem sea where the white house no longer 
existed. Sometimes Sam Uley was there in the forest, watching me again. I paid him no 
attention-there was no comfort in his presence; it made me feel no less alone. It didn't stop 
me from screaming myself awake, night after night. 

The hole in my chest was worse than ever. I'd thought that I'd been getting it under control, 
but I found myself hunched over, day after day, clutching my sides together and gasping for 
air. 



I wasn't handling alone well. 

I was relieved beyond measure the morning I woke up-screaming, of course-and 
remembered that it was Saturday. Today I could call Jacob. And if the phone lines still 
weren't working, then I was going to La Push. One way or another, today would be better 
than the last lonely week. 



I dialed, and then waited without high expectations. 




It caught me off guard when Billy answered on the second ring. 

"Hello?" 

"Oh, hey, the phone is working again! Hi, Billy. It's Bella. I was just calling to see how Jacob 
is doing. Is he up for visitors yet? I was thinking about dropping by-" 

"I'm sorry, Bella," Billy interrupted, and I wondered if he were watching TV; he sounded 
distracted. "He's not in." 

"Oh." It took me a second. "So he's feeling better then?" 

"Yeah," Billy hesitated for an instant too long. "Turns out it wasn't mono after all. Just some 
other virus." 

"Oh. So... where is he?" 

"He's giving some friends a ride up to Port Angeles-I think they were going to catch a 
double feature or something. He's gone for the whole day." 

"Well, that's a relief. I've been so worried. I'm glad he felt good enough to get out." My voice 
sounded horribly phony as I babbled on. 

Jacob was better, but not well enough to call me. He was out with friends. I was sitting 
home, missing him more every hour. I was lonely, worried, bored... perforated-and now also 
desolate as I realized that the week apart had not had the same effect on him. 

"Is there anything in particular you wanted?" Billy asked politely. 

"No, not really." 

"Well, I'll tell him that you called," Billy promised. "Bye, Bella." 

"Bye," I replied, but he'd already hung up. 

I stood for a moment with the phone still in my hand. 

Jacob must have changed his mind, just l ik e I'd feared. He was going to take my advice and 
not waste any more time on someone who couldn't return his feelings. I felt the blood run out 
of my face. 

"Something wrong?" Charlie asked as he came down the stairs. 

"No," I lied, hanging up the phone. "Billy says Jacob is feeling better. It wasn't mono. So 
that's good." 

"Is he coming here, or are you going there?" Charlie asked absentmindedly as he started 
poking through the fridge. 




Neither," I admitted. "He's going out with some other friends. 



The tone of my voice finally caught Charlie's attention. He looked up at me with sudden 
alarm, his hands frozen around a package of cheese slices. 

"Isn't it a little early for lunch?" I asked as lightly as I could manage, trying to distract him. 
"No, I'm just packing something to take out to the river. . ." 

"Oh, fishing today?" 

"Well, Harry called... and it's not raining." He was creating a stack of food on the counter as 
he spoke. Suddenly he looked up again as if he'd just realized something. "Say, did you want 
me to stay with you, since Jake's out?" 

"That's okay, Dad," I said, working to sound indifferent. "The fish bite better when the 
weather's nice." 

He stared at me, indecision clear on his face. I knew that he was worrying, afraid to leave me 
alone, in case I got "mopey" again. 

"Seriously, Dad. I think I'll call Jessica," I fibbed quickly. I'd rather be alone than have h im 
watching me all day. "We have a Calculus test to study for. I could use her help." That part 
was true. But I'd have to make do without it. 

"That's a good idea. You've been spending so much time with Jacob, your other friends are 
going to think you've forgotten them." 

I smiled and nodded as if I cared what my other friends thought. 

Charlie started to turn, but then spun back with a worried expression. "Hey, you'll study here 
or at Jess's, right?" 

"Sure, where else?" 

"Well, it's just that I want you to be careful to stay out of the woods, like I told you before." 

It took me a minute to understand, distracted as I was. "More bear trouble?" 

Charlie nodded, frowning. "We've got a missing hiker-the rangers found his camp early this 
morning, but no sign of him. There were some really big animal prints... of course those 
could have come later, smelling the food. . . Anyway, they're setting traps for it now." 

"Oh," I said vaguely. I wasn't really listening to his warnings; I was much more upset by the 
situation with Jacob than by the possibility of being eaten by a bear. 

I was glad that Charlie was in a hurry. He didn't wait for me to call Jessica, so I didn't have 
to put on that charade. I went through the motions of gathering my school-books on the 




kitchen table to pack them in my bag; that was probably too much, and if he hadn't been 
eager to hit the holes, it might have made him suspicious. 



I was so busy looking busy that the ferociously empty day ahead didn't really crash down on 
me until after I'd watched him drive away. It only took about two minutes of staring at the 
silent kitchen phone to decide that I wasn't staying home today. I considered my options. 

I wasn't going to call Jessica. As far as I could tell, Jessica had crossed over to the dark side. 

I could drive to La Push and get my motorcycle-an appealing thought but for one minor 
problem: who was going to drive me to the emergency room if I needed it afterward? 

Or. . . I already had our map and compass in the truck. I was pretty sure I understood the 
process well enough by now that I wouldn't get lost. Maybe I could eliminate two lines 
today, putting us ahead of schedule for whenever Jacob decided to honor me with his 
presence again. I refused to think about how long that might be. Or if it was going to be 
never. 

I felt a brief twinge of guilt as I realized how Charlie would feel about this, but I ignored it. I 
just couldn't stay in the house again today. 

A few minutes later I was on the familiar dirt road that led to nowhere in particular. I had the 
windows rolled down and I drove as fast as was healthy for my truck, trying to enjoy the 
wind against my face. It was cloudy, but almost dry-a very nice day, for Forks. 

Getting started took me longer than it would have taken Jacob. After I parked in the usual 
spot, I had to spend a good fifteen minutes studying the little needle on the compass face and 
the markings on the now worn map. When I was reasonably certain that I was following the 
right line of the web, I set off into the woods. 

The forest was full of life today, all the little creatures enjoying the momentary dryness. 
Somehow, though, even with the birds chirping and cawing, the insects buzzing noisily 
around my head, and the occasional scurry of the field mice through the shrubs, the forest 
seemed creepier today; it reminded me of my most recent nightmare. I knew it was just 
because I was alone, missing Jacob's carefree whistle and the sound of another pair of feet 
squishing across the damp ground. 

The sense of unease grew stronger the deeper I got into the trees. Breathing started to get 
more difficult-not because of exertion, but because I was having trouble with the stupid hole 
in my chest again. I kept my arms tight around my torso and tried to banish the ache from my 
thoughts. I almost turned around, but I hated to waste the effort I'd already expended. 

The rhythm of my footsteps started to numb my mind and my pain as I trudged on. My 
breathing evened out eventually, and I was glad I hadn't quit. I was getting better at this 
bushwhacking thing; I could tell I was faster. 




I didn't realize quite how much more efficiently I was moving. I thought I'd covered maybe 
four miles, and I wasn't even starting to look around for it yet. And then, with an abruptness 
that disoriented me, I stepped through a low arch made by two vine maples-pushing past the 
chest-high ferns-into the meadow. 

It was the same place, of that I was instantly sure. I'd never seen another clearing so 
symmetrical. It was as perfectly round as if someone had intentionally created the flawless 
circle, tearing out the trees but leaving no evidence of that violence in the waving grass. To 
the east, I could hear the stream bubbling quietly. 

The place wasn't nearly so stunning without the sunlight, but it was still very beautiful and 
serene. It was the wrong season for wildflowers; the ground was thick with tall grass that 
swayed in the light breeze l ik e ripples across a lake. 

It was the same place. . . but it didn't hold what I had been searching for. 

The disappointment was nearly as instantaneous as the recognition. I sank down right where 
I was, kneeling there at the edge of the clearing, beginning to gasp. 

What was the point of going any farther? Nothing lingered here. Nothing more than the 
memories that I could have called back whenever I wanted to, if I was ever willing to endure 
the corresponding pain-the pain that had me now, had me cold. There was nothing special 
about this place without him. I wasn't exactly sure what I'd hoped to feel here, but the 
meadow was empty of atmosphere, empty of everything, just l ik e everywhere else. Just like 
my nightmares. My head swirled dizzily. 

At least I'd come alone. I felt a rush of thankfulness as I realized that. If I'd discovered the 
meadow with Jacob... well, there was no way I could have disguised the abyss I was 
plunging into now. How could I have explained the way I was fracturing into pieces, the way 
I had to curl into a ball to keep the empty hole from tearing me apart? It was so much better 
that I didn't have an audience. 

And I wouldn't have to explain to anyone why I was in such a hurry to leave, either. Jacob 
would have assumed, after going to so much trouble to locate the stupid place, I would want 
to spend more than a few seconds here. But I was already trying to find the strength to get to 
my feet again, forcing myself out of the ball so that I could escape. There was too much pain 
in this empty place to bear-I would crawl away if I had to. 

How lucky that I was alone! 

Alone. I repeated the word with grim satisfaction as I wrenched myself to my feet despite the 
pain. At precisely that moment, a figure stepped out from the trees to the north, some thirty 
paces away. 



A dizzying array of emotions shot through me in a second. The first was surprise; I was far 
from any trail here, and I didn't expect company. Then, as my eyes focused on the motionless 




figure, seeing the utter stillness, the pallid skin, a rush of piercing hope rocked through me. I 
suppressed it viciously, fighting against the equally sharp lash of agony as my eyes continued 
to the face beneath the black hair, the face that wasn't the one I wanted to see. Next was 
fear; this was not the face I grieved for, but it was close enough for me to know that the man 
facing me was no stray h ik er. 

And finally, in the end, recognition. 

"Laurent!" I cried in surprised pleasure. 

It was an irrational response. I probably should have stopped at fear. 

Laurent had been one of James's coven when we'd first met. He hadn't been involved with 
the hunt that followed-the hunt where I was the quarry-but that was only because he was 
afraid; I was protected by a bigger coven than his own. It would have been different if that 
wasn't the case-he'd had no compunctions, at the time, against making a meal of me. Of 
course, he must have changed, because he'd gone to Alaska to live with the other civilized 
coven there, the other family that refused to drink human blood for ethical reasons. The other 
family like. . . but I couldn't let myself think the name. 

Yes, fear would have made more sense, but all I felt was an overwhelming satisfaction. The 
meadow was a magic place again. A darker magic than I'd expected, to be sure, but magic all 
the same. Here was the connection I'd sought. The proof, however remote, that-somewhere 
in the same world where I lived-/ie did exist. 

It was impossible how exactly the same Laurent looked. I suppose it was very silly and 
human to expect some kind of change in the last year. But there was something... I couldn't 
quite put my finger on it. 

"Bella?" he asked, looking more astonished than I felt. 

"You remember." I smiled. It was ridiculous that I should be so elated because a vampire 
knew my name. 

He grinned. "I didn't expect to see you here." He strolled toward me, his expression bemused. 

"Isn't it the other way around? I do live here. I thought you'd gone to Alaska." 

He stopped about ten paces away, cocking his head to the side. His face was the most 
beautiful face I'd seen in what felt l ik e an eternity. I studied his features with a strangely 
greedy sense of release. Here was someone I didn't have to pretend for-someone who already 
knew everything I could never say. 

"You're right," he agreed. "I did go to Alaska. Still, I didn't expect... When I found the 
Cullen place empty, I thought they'd moved on." 



Oh." I bit my lip as the name set the raw edges of my wound throbbing. It took me a second 




to compose myself. Laurent waited with curious eyes. 

"They did move on," I finally managed to tell him. 

"Hmm," he murmured. "I'm surprised they left you behind. Weren't you sort of a pet of 
theirs?" His eyes were innocent of any intended offense. 

I smiled wryly. "Something like that." 

"Hmm," he said, thoughtful again. 

At that precise moment, I realized why he looked the same-too much the same. After Carlisle 
told us that Laurent had stayed with Tanya's family, I'd begun to picture him, on the rare 
occasions that I thought of him at all, with the same golden eyes that the . . . Cullens-I forced 
the name out, wincing-had. That all good vampires had. 

I took an involuntary step back, and his curious, dark red eyes followed the movement. 

"Do they visit often?" he asked, still casual, but his weight shifted toward me. 

"Lie," the beautiful velvet voice whispered anxiously from my memory. 

I started at the sound of his voice, but it should not have surprised me. Was I nor in the worst 
danger imaginable? The motorcycle was safe as kittens next to this. 

I did what the voice said to do. 

"Now and again." I tried to make my voice light, relaxed. "The time seems longer to me, I 
imagine. You know how they get distracted..." I was beginning to babble. I had to work to 
shut myself up. 

"Hmm," he said again. "The house smelled like it had been vacant for a while. . ." 

"You must he better than that, Bella," the voice urged. 

I tried. "I'll have to mention to Carlisle that you stopped by. He'll be sorry they missed your 
visit." I pretended to deliberate for a second. "But I probably shouldn't mention it to... 
Edward, I suppose-" I barely managed to say his name, and it twisted my expression on the 
way out, ruining my bluff "-he has such a temper. . . well, I'm sure you remember. He's still 
touchy about the whole James thing." I rolled my eyes and waved one hand dismissively, l ik e 
it was all ancient history, but there was an edge of hysteria to my voice. I wondered if he 
would recognize what it was. 

"Is he really?" Laurent asked pleasantly. . . skeptically. 

I kept my reply short, so that my voice wouldn't betray my panic. "Mm-hmm." 

Laurent took a casual step to the side, gazing around at the little meadow. I didn't miss that 




the step brought him closer to me. In my head, the voice responded with a low snarl. 



"So how are things working out in Denali? Carlisle said you were staying with Tanya?" My 
voice was too high. 

The question made him pause. "I l ik e Tanya very much," he mused. "And her sister Irina even 
more... I've never stayed in one place for so long before, and I enjoy the advantages, the 
novelty of it. But, the restrictions are difficult. . . I'm surprised that any of them can keep it up 
for long." He smiled at me conspiratorially. "Sometimes I cheat." 

I couldn't swallow. My foot started to ease back, but I froze when his red eyes flickered 
down to catch the movement. 

"Oh," I said in a faint voice. "Jasper has problems with that, too." 

"Don't move," the voice whispered. I tried to do what he instructed. It was hard; the instinct 
to take flight was nearly uncontrollable. 

"Really?" Laurent seemed interested. "Is that why they left?" 

"No," I answered honestly. "Jasper is more careful at home." 

"Yes," Laurent agreed. "I am, too." 

The step forward he took now was quite deliberate. 

"Did Victoria ever find you?" I asked, breathless, desperate to distract him. It was the first 
question that popped into my head, and I regretted it as soon as the words were spoken. 
Victoria-who had hunted me with James, and then disappeared-was not someone I wanted 
to think of at this particular moment. 

But the question did stop him. 

"Yes," he said, hesitating on that step. "I actually came here as a favor to her." He made a 
face. "She won't be happy about this." 

"About what?" I said eagerly, inviting him to continue. He was glaring into the trees, away 
from me. I took advantage of his diversion, taking a furtive step back. 

He looked back at me and smiled-the expression made him look like a black-haired angel. 

"About me killing you," he answered in a seductive purr. 

I staggered back another step. The frantic growling in my head made it hard to hear. 

"She wanted to save that part for herself," he went on blithely. "She's sort of... put out with 
you, Bella." 




'Me?" I squeaked. 



He shook his head and chuckled. "I know, it seems a little backward to me, too. But James 
was her mate, and your Edward killed him." 

Even here, on the point of death, his name tore against my unhealed wounds like a serrated 
edge. 

Laurent was oblivious to my reaction. "She thought it more appropriate to kill you than 
Edward-fair turnabout, mate for mate. She asked me to get the lay of the land for her, so to 
speak. I didn't imagine you would be so easy to get to. So maybe her plan was 
flawed-apparently it wouldn't be the revenge she imagined, since you must not mean very 
much to him if he left you here unprotected." 

Another blow, another tear through my chest. 

Laurent's weight shifted slightly, and I stumbled another step back. 

He frowned. "I suppose she'll be angry, all the same." 

"Then why not wait for her?" I choked out. 

A mischievous grin rearranged his features. "Well, you've caught me at a bad time, Bella. I 
didn't come to this place on Victoria's mission-I was hunting. I'm quite thirsty, and you do 
smell... simply mouthwatering." 

Laurent looked at me with approval, as if he meant it as a compliment. 

"Threaten him," the beautiful delusion ordered, his voice distorted with dread. 

"He'll know it was you," I whispered obediently. "You won't get away with this." 

"And why not?" Laurent's smile widened. He gazed around the small opening in the trees. 
"The scent will wash away with the next rain. No one will find your body-you'll simply go 
missing, like so many, many other humans. There's no reason for Edward to think of me, if he 
cares enough to investigate. This is nothing personal, let me assure you, Bella. Just thirst." 

"Beg," my hallucination begged. 

"Please," I gasped. 

Laurent shook his head, his face kind. "Look at it this way, Bella. You're very lucky I was 
the one to find you." 

"Am I?" I mouthed, faltering another step back. 

Laurent followed, lithe and graceful. 




"Yes," he assured me. "I'll be very quick. You won't feel a thing, I promise. Oh, I'll he to 
Victoria about that later, naturally, just to placate her. But if you knew what she had planned 
for you, Bella..." He shook his head with a slow movement, almost as if in disgust. "I swear 
you'd be thanking me for this." 

I stared at him in horror. 

He sniffed at the breeze that blew threads of my hair in his direction. "Mouthwatering," he 
repeated, inhaling deeply. 

I tensed for the spring, my eyes squinting as I cringed away, and the sound of Edward's 
furious roar echoed distantly in the back of my head. His name burst through all the walls I'd 
built to contain it. Edward, Edward, Edward. I was going to die. It shouldn't matter if I 
thought of him now. Edward, I love you. 

Through my narrowed eyes, I watched as Laurent paused in the act of inhaling and whipped 
his head abruptly to the left. I was afraid to look away from him, to follow his glance, though 
he hardly needed a distraction or any other trick to overpower me. I was too amazed to feel 
relief when he started slowly backing away from me. 

"I don't believe it," he said, his voice so low that I barely heard it. 

I had to look then. My eyes scanned the meadow, searching for the interruption that had 
extended my life by a few seconds. At first I saw nothing, and my gaze flickered back to 
Laurent. He was retreating more quickly now, his eyes boring into the forest. 

Then I saw it; a huge black shape eased out of the trees, quiet as a shadow, and stalked 
deliberately toward the vampire. It was enormous-as tall as a horse, but thicker, much more 
muscular. The long muzzle grimaced, revealing a line of dagger-like incisors. A grisly snarl 
rolled out from between the teeth, rumbling across the clearing like a prolonged crack of 
thunder. 

The bear. Only, it wasn't a bear at all. Still, this gigantic black monster had to be the creature 
causing all the alarm. Lrom a distance, anyone would assume it was a bear. What else could 
be so vast, so powerfully built? 

I wished I were lucky enough to see it from a distance. Instead, it padded silently through the 
grass a mere ten feet from where I stood. 

"Don't move an inch," Edward's voice whispered. 

I stared at the monstrous creature, my mind boggling as I tried to put a name to it. There was 
a distinctly canine cast to the shape of it, the way it moved. I could only think of one 
possibility, locked in horror as I was. Yet I'd never imagined that a wolf could get so big. 



Another growl rumbled in its throat, and I shuddered away from the sound. 




Laurent was backing toward the edge of the trees, and, under the freezing terror, confusion 
swept through me. Why was Laurent retreating? Granted, the wolf was monstrous in size, 
but it was just an animal. What reason would a vampire have for fearing an animal? And 
Laurent was afraid. His eyes were wide with horror, just like mine. 

As if in answer to my question, suddenly the mammoth wolf was not alone. Flanking it on 
either side, another two gigantic beasts prowled silently into the meadow. One was a deep 
gray, the other brown, neither one quite as tall as the first. The gray wolf came through the 
trees only a few feet from me, its eyes locked on Laurent. 

Before I could even react, two more wolves followed, lined up in a V, like geese flying 
south. Which meant that the rusty brown monster that shrugged through the brush last was 
close enough for me to touch. 

I gave an involuntary gasp and jumped back-which was the stupidest thing I could have 
done. I froze again, waiting for the wolves to turn on me, the much weaker of the available 
prey. I wished briefly that Laurent would get on with it and crush the wolf pack-it should be 
so simple for him. I guessed that, between the two choices before me, being eaten by wolves 
was almost certainly the worse option. 

The wolf closest to me, the reddish brown one, turned its head slightly at the sound of my 
gasp. 

The wolfs eyes were dark, nearly black. It gazed at me for a fraction of a second, the deep 
eyes seeming too intelligent for a wild animal. 

As it stared at me, I suddenly thought of Jacob-again, with gratitude. At least I'd come here 
alone, to this fairytale meadow filled with dark monsters. At least Jacob wasn't going to die, 
too. At least I wouldn't have his death on my hands. 

Then another low growl from the leader caused the russet wolf to whip his head around, 
back toward Laurent. 

Laurent was staring at the pack of monster wolves with unconcealed shock and fear. The 
first I could understand. But I was stunned when, without warning, he spun and disappeared 
into the trees. 

He ran away. 

The wolves were after him in a second, sprinting across the open grass with a few powerful 
bounds, snarling and snapping so loudly that my hands flew up instinctively to cover my ears. 
The sound faded with surprising swiftness once they disappeared into the woods. 

And then I was alone again. 

My knees buckled under me, and I fell onto my hands, sobs building in my throat. 




I knew I needed to leave, and leave now. How long would the wolves chase Laurent before 
they doubled back for me? Or would Laurent turn on them? Would he be the one that came 
looking? 

I couldn't move at first, though; my arms and legs were shaking, and I didn't know how to 
get back to my feet. 

My mind couldn't move past the fear, the horror or the confusion. I didn't understand what 
I'd just witnessed. 

A vampire should not have run from overgrown dogs l ik e that. What good would their teeth 
be against his granite skin? 

And the wolves should have given Laurent a wide berth. Even if their extraordinary size had 
taught them to fear nothing, it still made no sense that they would pursue him. I doubted his 
icy marble skin would smell anything l ik e food. Why would they pass up something 
warmblooded and weak l ik e me to chase after Laurent? 

I couldn't make it add up. 

A cold breeze whipped through the meadow, swaying the grass l ik e something was moving 
through it. 

I scrambled to my feet , backing away even though the wind brushed harmlessly past me. 
Stumbling in panic, I turned and ran headlong into the trees. 

The next few hours were agony. It took me three times as long to escape the trees as it had 
to get to the meadow. 

At first I paid no attention to where I was headed, focused only on what I was running from 
By the time I collected myself enough to remember the compass, I was deep in the unfamiliar 
and menacing forest. My hands were shaking so violently that I had to set the compass on 
the muddy ground to be able to read it. Every few minutes I would stop to put the compass 
dowr and check that I was still heading northwest, hearing-when the sounds weren't hidden 
behind the frantic squelching of my footsteps-the quiet whisper of unseen things moving in 
the leaves. 

The call of a jaybird made me leap back and fall into a thick stand of young spruce, scraping 
up my arms and tangling my hair with sap. The sudden rush of a squirrel up a hemlock made 
me scream so loud it hurt my own ears. 

At last there was a break in the trees ahead. I came out onto the empty road a mile or so 
south of where I'd left the truck. Exhausted as I was, I jogged up the lane until I found it. By 
the time I pulled myself into the cab, I was sobbing again. I fiercely shoved down both stiff 
locks before I dug my keys out of my pocket. The roar of the engine was comforting and 
sane. It helped me control the tears as I sped as fast as my truck would allow toward the 




main highway. 

I was calmer, but still a mess when I got home. Charlie's cruiser was in the driveway-I hadn't 
realized how late it was. The sky was already dusky. 

"Bella?" Charlie asked when I slammed the front door behind me and hastily turned the 
locks. 

"Yeah, it's me." My voice was unsteady. 

"Where have you been?" he thundered, appearing through the kitchen doorway with an 
ominous expression. 

I hesitated. He'd probably called the Stanleys. I'd better stick to the truth. 

"I was hiking," I admitted. 

His eyes were tight. "What happened to going to Jessica's?" 

"I didn't feel like Calculus today." 

Charlie folded his arms across his chest. "I thought I asked you to stay out of the forest." 
"Yeah, I know. Don't worry, I won't do it again." I shuddered. 

Charlie seemed to really look at me for the first time. I remembered that I had spent some 
time on the forest floor today; I must be a mess. 

"What happened?" Charlie demanded. 

Again, I decided that the truth, or part of it anyway, was the best option. I was too shaken to 
pretend that I'd spent an uneventful day with the flora and fauna. 

"I saw the bear." I tried to say it calmly, but my voice was high and shaky. "It's not a bear, 
though-it's some kind of wolf. And there are five of them. A big black one, and gray, and 
reddish-brown. . . " 

Charlie's eyes grew round with horror. He strode quickly to me and grabbed the tops of my 
arms. 



"Are you okay?" 

My head bobbed in a weak nod. 

"Tell me what happened." 

"They didn't pay any attention to me. But aftet they were gone, I ran away and I fell down a 
lot." 




He let go of my shoulders and wrapped his arms around me. For a long moment, he didn't say 
anything. 

"Wolves," he murmured. 

"What?" 

"The rangers said the tracks were wrong for a bear-but wolves just don't get that big. . ." 
"These were huge.” 

"How many did you say you saw?" 

"Five." 

Charlie shook his head, frowning with anxiety. He finally spoke in a tone that allowed no 
argument. "No more hiking." 

"No problem," I promised fervently. 

Charlie called the station to report what I'd seen. I fudged a little bit about where exactly I'd 
seen the wolves-claiming I'd been on the trail that led to the north. I didn't want my dad to 
know how deep I'd gone into the forest against his wishes, and, more importantly, I didn't 
want anyone wandering near where Laurent might be searching for me. The thought of it 
made me feel sick. 

"Are you hungry?" he asked me when he hung up the phone. 

I shook my head, though I must have been starving. I hadn't eaten all day. 

"Just tired," I told him. I turned for the stairs. 

"Hey," Charlie said, his voice suddenly suspicious again. "Didn't you say Jacob was gone for 
the day?" 

"That's what Billy said," I told him, confused by his question. 

He studied my expression for a minute, and seemed satisfied with what he saw there. 

"Huh." 

"Why?" I demanded. It sounded l ik e he was implying that I'd been lying to him this morning. 
About something besides studying with Jessica. 

"Well, it's just that when I went to pick up Harry, I saw Jacob out in front of the store down 
there with some of his friends. I waved hi, but he. . . well, I guess I don't know if he saw me. I 
think maybe he was arguing with his friends. He looked strange, l ik e he was upset about 
something. And... different. It's l ik e you can watch that kid growing! He gets bigger every 




time I see him. 



"Billy said Jake and his friends were going up to Port Angeles to see some movies. They 
were probably just waiting for someone to meet them." 

"Oh." Charlie nodded and headed for the kitchen. 

I stood in the hall, thinking about Jacob arguing with his friends. I wondered if he had 
confronted Embry about the situation with Sam. Maybe that was the reason he'd ditched me 
today-if it meant he could sort things out with Embry, I was glad he had. 

I paused to check the locks again before I went to my room. It was a silly thing to do. What 
difference would a lock make to any of the monsters I'd seen this afternoon? I assumed the 
handle alone would stymie the wolves, not having opposable thumbs. And if Laurent came 
here... 

Or... Victoria. 

I lay down on my bed, but I was shaking too hard to hope for sleep. I curled into a cramped 
ball under my quilt, and faced the horrifying facts. 

There was nothing I could do. There were no precautions I could take. There was no place I 
could hide. There was no one who could help me. 

I realized, with a nauseous roll of my stomach, that the situation was worse than even that. 
Because all those facts applied to Charlie, too. My father, sleeping one room away from me, 
was just a hairsbreadth off the heart of the target that was centered on me. My scent would 
lead them here, whether I was here or not. 

The tremors rocked me until my teeth chattered. 

To calm myself, I fantasized the impossible: I imagined the big wolves catching up to 
Laurent in the woods and massacring the indestructible immortal the way they would any 
normal person. Despite the absurdity of such a vision, the idea comforted me. If the wolves 
got him, then he couldn't tell Victoria I was here all alone. If he didn't return, maybe she'd 
think the Cullens were still protecting me. If only the wolves could win such a fight. . . 

My good vampires were never coming back; how soothing it was to imagine that the other 
kind could also disappear. 

I squeezed my eyes tight together and waited for unconsciousness-almost eager for my 
nightmare to start. Better that than the pale, beautiful face that smiled at me now from 
behind my lids. 

In my imagination, Victoria's eyes were black with thirst, bright with anticipation, and her 
lips curled back from her gleaming teeth in pleasure. Her red hair was brilliant as fire; it blew 
chaotically around her wild face. 




Laurent's words repeated in my head. If you knew what she had planned for you 
I pressed my fist against my mouth to keep from screaming. 




11. CULT 



EACH TIME THAT I OPENED MY EYES TO THE MORNING light and realized I'd 
lived through another night was a surprise to me. After the surprise wore off, my heart would 
start to race and my palms would sweat; I couldn't really breathe again until I'd gotten up and 
ascertained that Charlie had survived as well. 

I could tell he was worried-watching me jump at any loud sound, or my face suddenly go 
white for no reason that he could see. From the questions he asked now and then, he seemed 
to blame the change on Jacob's continued absence. 

The terror that was always foremost in my thoughts usually distracted me from the fact that 
another week had passed, and Jacob still hadn't called me. But when I was able to 
concentrate on my normal life-if my life was really ever normal-this upset me. 

I missed him horribly. 

It had been bad enough to be alone before I was scared silly. Now, more than ever, I yearned 
for his carefree laugh and his infectious grin. I needed the safe sanity of his homemade garage 
and his warm hand around my cold fingers. 

I'd half expected h im to call on Monday. If there had been some progress with Embry, 
wouldn't he want to report it? I wanted to believe that it was worry for his friend that was 
occupying all his time, not that he was just giving up on me. 

I called him Tuesday, but no one answered. Were the phone lines still having problems? Or 
had Billy invested in caller I.D.? 

On Wednesday I called every half hour until after eleven at night, desperate to hear the 
warmth of Jacob's voice. 

Thursday I sat in my truck in front of my house-with the locks pushed down-keys in hand, 
for a solid hour. I was arguing with myself, trying to justify a quick trip to La Push, but I 
couldn't do it. 

I knew that Laurent had gone back to Victoria by now. If I went to La Push, I took the 
chance of leading one of them there. What if they caught up to me when Jake was nearby? 
As much as it hurt me, I knew it was better for Jacob that he was avoiding me. Safer for him. 

It was bad enough that I couldn't figure out a way to keep Charlie safe. Nighttime was the 
most likely time that they would come looking ior me, and what could I say to get Charlie 
out of the house? If I told him the truth, he'd have me locked up in a rubber room 
somewhere. I would have endured that-welcomed it, even-if it could have kept him safe. 
But Victoria would still come to his house first, looking for me. Maybe, if she found me here, 
that would be enough for her. Maybe she would just leave when she was done with me. 




So I couldn't run away. Even if I could, where would I go? To Renee? I shuddered at the 
thought of dragging my lethal shadows into my mother's safe, sunny world. I would never 
endanger her that way. 

The worry was eating a hole in my stomach. Soon I would have matching punctures. 

That night, Charlie did me another favor and called Harry again to see if the Blacks were out 
of town. Harry reported that Billy had attended the council meeting Wednesday night, and 
never mentioned anything about leaving. Charlie warned me not to make a nuisance of 
myself-Jacob would call when he got around to it. 

Friday afternoon, as I drove home from school, it hit me out of the blue. 

I wasn't paying attention to the familiar road, letting the sound of the engine deaden my brain 
and silence the worries, when my subconscious delivered a verdict it must have been 
working on for some time without my knowledge. 

As soon as I thought of it, I felt really stupid for not seeing it sooner. Sure. I'd had a lot on 
my mind-revenue-obsessed vampires, giant mutant wolves, a ragged hole in the center of my 
chest-but when I laid the evidence out, it was embarrassingly obvious. 

Jacob avoiding me. Charlie saying he looked strange, upset. . . . Billy's vague, unhelpful 
answers. 

Holy crow, I knew exactly what was going on with Jacob. 

It was Sam Uley. Even my nightmares had been trying to tell me that. Sam had gotten to 
Jacob. Whatever was happening to the other boys on the reservation had reached out and 
stolen my friend. He'd been sucked into Sam's cult. 

He hadn't given up on me at all, I realized with a rush of feeling. 

I let my truck idle in front of my house. What should I do? I weighed the dangers against 
each other. 

If I went looking for Jacob, I risked the chance of Victoria or Laurent finding me with him. 

If I didn't go after him, Sam would pull him deeper into his frightening, compulsory gang. 
Maybe it would be too late if I didn't act soon. 

It had been a week, and no vampires had come for me yet. A week was more than enough 
time for them to have returned, so I must not be a priority. Most likely, as I'd decided before, 
they would come for me at night. The chances of them following me to La Push were much 
lower than the chance of losing Jacob to Sam. 

It was worth the danger of the secluded forest road. This was no idle visit to see what was 
going on. I knew what was going on. This was a rescue mission. I was going to talk to 




Jacob-kidnap him if I had to. I'd once seen a PBS show on deprogramming the brainwashed. 
There had to be some kind of cure. 



I decided I'd better call Charlie first. Maybe whatever was going on down in La Push was 
something the police should be involved in. I dashed inside, in a hurry to be on my way. 

Charlie answered the phone it the station himself. 

’’Chief Swan." 

"Dad, it's Bella." 

"What's wrong?"' 

I couldn't argue with his doomsday assumption this time. My voice was shaking. 

"I'm worried about Jacob." 

"Why?" he asked, surprised by the unexpected topic. 

"I think... I think something weird is going on down at the reservation. Jacob told me about 
some strange stuff happening with the other boys his age. Now he's acting the same way and 
I'm scared." 

"What kind of stuff?" He used his professional, police business voice. That was good; he was 
taking me seriously. 

"First he was scared, and then he was avoiding me, and now... I'm afraid he's part of that 
bizarre gang down there, Sam's gang. Sam Uley's gang." 

"Sam Uley?" Charlie repeated, surprised again. 

"Yes." 

Charlie's voice was more relaxed when he answered. "I think you've got it wrong, Bells. Sam 
Uley is a great kid. Well, he's a man now. A good son. You should hear Billy talk about him. 
He's really doing wonders with the youth on the reservation. He's the one who-" Charlie 
broke off mid-sentence, and I guessed that he had been about to make a reference to the 
night I'd gotten lost in the woods. I moved on quickly. 

"Dad, it's not l ik e that. Jacob was scared of him." 

"Did you talk to Billy about this?" He was trying to soothe me now. I'd lost him as soon as 
I'd mentioned Sam. 

"Billy's not concerned." 

"Well, Bella, then I'm sure it's okay. Jacob's a kid; he was probably just messing around. I'm 




sure he's fine. He can't spend every waking minute with you, after all." 

"This isn't about me," I insisted, but the battle was lost. 

"I don't think you need to worry about this. Let Billy take care of Jacob." 

"Charlie..." My voice was starting to sound whiney. 

"Bells, I got a lot on my plate right now. Two tourists have gone missing off a trail outside 
crescent lake." There was an anxious edge to his voice. "This wolf problem is getting out of 
hand." 

I was momentarily distracted-stunned, really-by his news. There was no way the wolves 
could have survived a match-up with Laurent. . . 

"Are you sure that's what happened to them?" I asked. 

"Afraid so, honey. There was-" He hesitated. "There were tracks again, and... some blood 
this time." 

"Oh!" It must not have come to a confrontation, then. Laurent must have simply outrun the 
wolves, but why? What I'd seen in the meadow just got stranger and stranger-more 
impossible to understand. 

"Look, I really have to go. Don't worry about Jake, Bella. I'm sure it's nothing." 

"Fine," I said curtly, frustrated as his words reminded me of the more urgent crisis at hand. 
"Bye." I hang up. 

I stared at the phone for a long minute. What the hell, I decided. 

Billy answered after two rings. 

"Hello?" 

"Hey, Billy," I almost growled. I tried to sound more friendly as I continued. "Can I talk to 
Jacob, please?" 

"Jake's not here." 

What a shock. "Do you know where he is?" 

"He's out with his friends." Billy's voice was careful. 

"Oh yeah? Anyone I know? Quil?" I could tell the words didn't come across as casually as I'd 
meant them to. 

"No," Billy said slowly. "I don't think he's with Quil today." 




I knew better than to mention Sam's name. 



"Embry?" I asked. 

Billy seemed happier to answer this one. "Yeah, he's with Embry." 

That was enough for me. Embry was one of them. 

"Well, have him call me when he gets in, all right?" 

"Sure, sure. No problem." Click. 

"See you soon, Billy," I muttered into the dead phone. 

I drove to La Push determined to wait. I'd sit out front of his house all night if I had to. I'd 
miss school. The boy was going to have to come home sometime, and when he did, he was 
going to have to talk to me. 

My mind was so preoccupied that the trip I'd been terrified of making seemed to take only a 
few seconds. Before I was expecting it, the forest began to thin, and I knew I would soon be 
able to see the first little houses of the reservation. 

Walking away, along the left side of the road, was a tall boy with a baseball cap. 

My breath caught for just a moment in my throat, hopeful that luck was with me for once, 
and I'd srumbled across Jacob without hardly trying. But this boy was too wide, and the hair 
was short under the hat. Even from behind, I was sure it was Quil, though he looked bigger 
than the last time I'd seen him. What was with these Quileute boys? Were they feeding them 
experimental growth hormones? 

I crossed over to the wrong side of the road to stop next to him. He looked up when the roar 
of my truck approached. 

Quil's expression frightened me more than it surprised me. His face was bleak, brooding, his 
forehead creased with worry. 

"Oh, hey, Bella," he greeted me dully. 

"Hi, Quil. . . Are you okay?" 

He stared at me morosely. "Fine." 

"Can I give you a ride somewhere?" I offered. 

"Sure, I guess," he mumbled. He shuffled around the front of the truck and opened the 
passenger door to climb in. 



'Where to? 




"My house is on the north side, back behind the store," he told me. 

"Have you seen Jacob today." The question burst from me almost before he'd finished 
speaking. 

I looked at Quil eagerly, waiting for his answer. He stared out the windshield for a second 
before he spoke. "From a distance," he finally said. 

"A distance?" I echoed. 

"I tried to follow them-he was with Embry." His voice was low, hard to hear over the 
engine. I leaned closer. "I know they saw me. But they turned and just disappeared into the 
trees. I don't think they were alone-I think Sam and his crew might have been with them. 

"I've been stumbling around in the forest for an hour, yelling for them. I just barely found the 
road again when you drove up." 

"So Sam did get to him." The words were a little distorted-my teeth were gritted together. 
Quil stared at me. "You know about that.?" 

I nodded. "Jake told me. . . before." 

"Before," Quil repeated, and sighed. 

"Jacob's just as bad as the others now?" 

"Never leaves Sam's side." Quil turned his head and spit out the open window. 

"And before that-did he avoid everyone? Was he acting upset?" 

His voice was low and rough. "Not for as long as the others. Maybe one day. Then Sam 
caught up with him." 

"What do you think it is? Drugs or something?" 

"I can't see Jacob or Embry getting into anything l ik e that. . . but what do I know? What else 
could it be? And why aren't the old people worried?" He shook his head, and the fear showed 
in his eyes now. "Jacob didn't want to be a part of this... cult. I don't understand what could 
change him." He stared at me, his face frightened. "I don't want to be next!' 

My eyes mirrored his fear. That was the second time I'd heard it described as a cult. I 
shivered. "Are your parents any help?" 

He grimaced. "Right. My grandfather's on the council with Jacob's dad. Sam Uley is the best 
thing that ever happened to this place, as far as he's concerned." 



We stared at each other for a prolonged moment. We were in La Push now, and my truck 




was barely crawling along the empty road. I could see the village's only store not too far 
ahead. 

"I'll get out now," Quil said. "My house is right over there." He gestured toward the small 
wooden rectangle behind the store. I pulled over to the shoulder, and he jumped out. 

"I'm going to go wait for Jacob," I told him in a hard voice. 

"Good luck." He slammed the door and shuffled forward along the road, his head bent 
forward, his shoulders slumped. 

Quil's face haunted me as I made a wide U-tum and headed back toward the Blacks'. He was 
terrified of being next. What was happening here? 

I stopped in front of Jacob's house, killing the motor and rolling down the windows. It was 
stuffy today, no breeze. I put my feet up on the dashboard and settled in to wait. 

A movement flashed in my peripheral vision-I turned and spotted Billy looking at me 
through the front window with a confused expression. I waved once and smiled a tight smile, 
but stayed where I was. 

His eyes narrowed; he let the curtain fall across the glass. 

I was prepared to stay as long as it took, but I wished I had something to do. I dug up a pen 
out of the bottom of my backpack, and an old test. I started to doodle on the back of the 
scrap. 

I'd only had time to scrawl one row of diamonds when there was a sharp tap against my door. 
I jumped, looking up, expecting Billy. 

"What are you doing here, Bella.'" Jacob growled. 

I stared at him in blank astonishment. 

Jacob had changed radically in the last weeks since I'd seen him. The first thing I noticed was 
his hair-his beautiful hair was all gone, cropped quite short, covering his head with an inky 
gloss l ik e black satin. The planes of his face seemed to have hardened subtly, tightened... 
aged. His neck and his shoulders were different, too, thicker somehow. His hands, where 
they gripped the window frame, looked enormous, with the tendons and veins more 
prominent under the russet skin. But the physical changes were insignificant. 

It was his expression that made him almost completely unrecognizable. The open, friendly 
smile was gone l ik e the hair, the warmth in his dark eyes altered to a brooding resentment 
that was instantly disturbing. There was a darkness in Jacob now. Like my sun had imploded. 



'Jacob?" I whispered. 




He just stared at me, his eyes tense and angry. 



I realized we weren't alone. Behind him stood four others; all tall and russet-skinned, black 
hair chopped short just l ik e Jacob's. They could have been brothers-I couldn't even pick 
Embry out of the group. The resemblance was only intensified by the strikingly similar 
hostility in every pair of eyes. 

Every pair but one. The oldest by several years, Sam stood in the very back, his face serene 
and sure. I had to swallow back the bile that rose in my throat. I wanted to take a swing at 
him. No, I wanted to do more than that. More than anything, I wanted to be fierce and 
deadly, someone no one would dare mess with. Someone who would scare Sam Uley silly. 

I wanted to be a vampire. 

The violent desire caught me off guard and knocked the wind out of me. It was the most 
forbidden of all wishes-even when I only wished it for a malicious reason like this, to gain an 
advantage over an enemy-because it was the most painful. That future was lost to me 
forever, had never really been within my grasp. I scrambled to gain control of myself while 
the hole in my chest ached hollowly. 

"What do you want?" Jacob demanded, his expression growing more resentful as he watched 
the play of emotion across my face. 

"I want to talk to you," I said in a weak voice. I tried to focus, but I was still reeling against 
the escape of my taboo dream. 

"Go ahead," he hissed through his teeth. His glare was vicious. I'd never seen him look at 
anyone like that, least of all me. It hurt with a surprising intensity-a physical pain, a stabbing 
in my head. 

"Alone!" I hissed, and my voice was stronger. 

He looked behind him, and I knew where his eyes would go. Every one of them was turned 
for Sam's reaction. 

Sam nodded once, his face unperturbed. He made a brief comment in an unfamiliar, liquid 
language-I could only be positive that it wasn't French or Spanish, but I guessed that it was 
Quileute. He turned and walked into Jacob's house. The others, Paul, Jared, and Embry, I 
assumed, followed him in. 

"Okay." Jacob seemed a bit less furious when the others were gone. His face was a little 
calmer, but also more hopeless. His mouth seemed permanently pulled down at the comers. 

I took a deep breath. "You know what I want to know." 

He didn't answer. He just stared at me bitterly. 




I stared back and the silence stretched on. The pain in his face unnerved me. I felt a lump 
beginning to build in my throat. 

"Can we walk?" I asked while I could still speak. 

He didn't respond in any way; his face didn't change. 

I got out of the car, feeling unseen eyes behind the windows on me, and started walking 
toward the trees to the north. My feet squished in the damp grass and mud beside the road, 
and, as that was the only sound, at first I thought he wasn't following me. But when I 
glanced around, he was right beside me, his feet having somehow found a less noisy path 
than mine. 

I felt better in the fringe of trees, where Sam couldn't possibly be watching. As we walked, I 
struggled for the right thing to say, but nothing came. I just got more and more angry that 
Jacob had gotten sucked in... that Billy had allowed this... that Sam was able to stand there 
so assured and calm. . . 

Jacob suddenly picked up the pace, striding ahead of me easily with his long legs, and then 
swinging around to face me, planting himself in my path so I would have to stop too. 

I was distracted by the overt grace of his movement. Jacob had been nearly as klutzy as me 
with his never-ending growth spurt. When did that changed? 

But Jacob didn't give me time to think about it. 

"Let's get this over with," he said in a hard, husky voice. 

I waited. He knew what I wanted. 

"It's not what you think." His voice was abruptly weary. "It's not what I thought-I was way 
off." 

"So what is it, then?" 

He studied my face for a long moment, speculating. The anger never completely left his eyes. 
"I can't tell you," he finally said. 

My jaw tightened, and I spoke through my teeth. "I thought we were friends." 

"We were." There was a slight emphasis on the past tense. 

"But you don't need friends anymore," I said sourly. "You have Sam. Isn't that nice-you've 
always looked up to him so much." 

"I didn't understand h im before." 



And now you've seen the light. Hallelujah. 




"It wasn't l ik e I thought it was. This isn't Sam's fault. He's helping me as much as he can." 
His voice turned brittle and he looked over my head, past me, rage burning out from his eyes. 

"He's helping you," I repeated dubiously. "Naturally." 

But Jacob didn't seem to be listening. He was taking deep, deliberate breaths, trying to calm 
himself. He was so mad that his hands were shaking. 

"Jacob, please," I whispered "Won't you tell me what happened? Maybe I can help." 

"No one can help me now." The words were a low moan; his voice broke. 

"What did he do to you?" I demanded, tears collecting in my eyes. I reached out to him, as I 
had once before, stepping forward with my arms wide. 

This time he cringed away, holding his hands up defensively. "Don't touch me," he 
whispered. 

"Is Sam catching?" I mumbled. The stupid tears had escaped the corners of my eyes. I wiped 
them away with the back of my hand, and folded my arms across my chest. 

"Stop blaming Sam." The words came out fast, like a reflex. His hands reached up to twist 
around the hair that was no longer there, and then fell limply at his sides. 

"Then who should I blame?" I retorted. 

He halfway smiled; it was a bleak, twisted thing. 

"You don't want to hear that." 

"The hell I don't!" I snapped. "I want to know, and I want to know now." 

"You're wrong," he snapped back. 

"Don't you dare tell me I'm wrong-I'm not the one who got brainwashed! Tell me now 
whose fault this all is, if it's not your precious Sam!" 

"You asked for it," he growled at me, eyes glinting hard. "If you want to blame someone, 
why don't you point your finger at those filthy, reeking bloodsuckers that you love so much?" 

My mouth fell open and my breath came out with a whooshing sound. I was frozen in place, 
stabbed through with his double-edged words. The pain twisted in familiar patterns through 
my body, the jagged hole ripping me open from the inside out, but it was second place, 
background music to the chaos of my thoughts. I couldn't believe that I'd heard h im 
correctly. There was no trace of indecision in his face. Only fury. 



My mouth still hung wide. 




"I told you that you didn't want to hear it," he said. 

"I don't understand who you mean," I whispered. 

He raised one eyebrow in disbelief. "I think you understand exactly who I mean. You're not 
going to make me say it, are you? I don't l ik e hurting you." 

"I don't understand who you mean," I repeated mechanically. 

"The Cullens, " he said slowly, drawing out the word, scrutinizing my face as he spoke it. "I 
saw that-I can see in your eyes what it does to you when I say their name." 

I shook my head back and forth in denial, trying to clear it at the same time. How did he 
know this? And how did it have anything to do with Sam's cult? Was it a gang of 
vampire-haters? What was the point of forming such a society when no vampires lived in 
Forks anymore? Why would Jacob start believing the stories about the Cullens now, when 
the evidence of them was long gone, never to return? 

It took me too long to come up with the correct response. "Don't tell me you're listening to 
Billy's superstitious nonsense now," I said with a feeble attempt at mockery. 

"He knows more than I gave him credit for." 

"Be serious, Jacob." 

He glared at me, his eyes critical. 

"Superstitions aside," I said quickly. "I still don't see what you're accusing the... 
Cullens "-wince-"of. They left more than half a year ago. How can you blame them for what 
Sam is doing now?" 

"Sam isn't doing anything, Bella. And I know they're gone. But sometimes. . . things are set in 
motion, and then it's too late." 

"What's set in motion? What's too late? What are you blaming them for?" 

He was suddenly right in my face, his fury glowing in his eyes. "For existing," he hissed. 

I was surprised and distracted as the warning words came in Edward's voice again, when I 
wasn't even scared. 

"Quiet now, Bella. Don't push him," Edward cautioned in my ear. 

Ever since Edward's name had broken through the careful walls I'd buried it behind, I'd been 
unable to lock it up again. It didn't hurt now-not during the precious seconds when I could 
hear his voice. 



Jacob was fuming in front of me, quivering with anger. 




I didn't understand why the Edward delusion was unexpectedly in my mind. Jacob was livid, 
but he was Jacob. There was no adrenaline, no danger. 

"Give h im a chance to calm down," Edward's voice insisted. 

I shook my head in confusion. "You're being ridiculous," I told them both. 

"Fine," Jacob answered, breathing deeply again. "I won't argue it with you. It doesn't matter 
anyway, the damage is done." 

"What damage?” 

He didn't flinch as I shouted the words in his face. 

"Let's head back. There's nothing more to say." 

I gaped. "There's everything more to say! You haven't said anything yet!" 

He walked past me, striding back toward the house. 

"I ran into Quil today," I yelled after him. 

He paused midstep, but didn't turn. 

"You remember your friend, Quil? Yeah, he's terrified." 

Jacob whirled to face me. His expression was pained. "Quil" was all he said. 

"He's worried about you, too. He's freaked out." 

Jacob stared past me with desperate eyes. 

I goaded him further. "He's frightened that he's next." 

Jacob clutched at a tree for support, his face turning a strange shade of green under the 
red-brown surface. "He won't be next," Jacob muttered to himself. "He can't be. It's over 
now. This shouldn't still be happening. Why? Why?" His fist slammed against the tree. It 
wasn't a big tree, slender and only a few feet taller than Jacob. But it still surprised me when 
tht trunk gave way and snapped off loudly under his blows. 

Jacob stared at the sharp, broken point with shock that quickly turned to horror. 

"I have to get back." He whirled and stalked away so swiftly that I had to jog to keep up. 

"Back to Sam!" 

"That's one way of looking at it," it sounded like he said. He was mumbling and facing away. 
I chased him back to the truck. "Wait!" I called as he turned toward the house. 




He spun around to face me, and I saw that his hands were shaking again. 

"Go home, Bella. I can't hang out with you anymore." 

The silly, inconsequential hurt was incredibly potent. The tears welled up again. "Are you... 
breaking up with me?" The words were all wrong, but they were the best way I could think 
to phrase what I was asking. After all, what Jake and I had was more than any schoolyard 
romance. Stronger. 

He barked out a bitter laugh. "Hardly. If that were the case, I'd say 'Let's stay friends.' I can't 
even say that." 

"Jacob... why? Sam won't let you have other friends? Please, Jake. You promised. I need 
you!" The blank emptiness of my life before-before Jacob brought some semblance of reason 
back into it-reared up and confronted me. Loneliness choked in my throat. 

"I'm sorry, Bella," Jacob said each word distinctly in a cold voice that didn't seem to belong 
to him. 

I didn't believe that this was really what Jacob wanted to say. It seemed l ik e there was 
something else trying to be said through his angry eyes, but I couldn't understand the 
message. 

Maybe this wasn't about Sam at all. Maybe this had nothing to do with the Cullens. Maybe 
he was just trying to pull himself out of a hopeless situation. Maybe I should let him do that, 
if that's what was best for him. I should do that. It would be right. 

But I heard my voice escaping in a whisper. 

"I'm sorry that I couldn't... before... I wish I could change how I feel about you, Jacob." I 
was desperate, reaching, stretching the truth so far that it curved nearly into the shape of a 
lie. "Maybe... maybe I would change," I whispered. "Maybe, if you gave me some time... 
just don't quit on me now, Jake. I can't take it." 

His face went from anger to agony in a second. One shaking hand reached out toward me. 

"No. Don't think l ik e that, Bella, please. Don't blame yourself, don't think this is your fault. 
This one is all me. I swear, it's not about you." 

"It's not you, it's me," I whispered. "There's a new one." 

"I mean it, Bella. I'm not..." he struggled, his voice going even huskier as he fought to 
control his emotion. His eyes were tortured. "I'm not good enough to be your friend anymore, 
or anything else. I'm not what I was before. I'm not good." 

"What?" I stared at him, confused and appalled. "What are you saying ? You're much better 
than I am, Jake. You are good! Who told you that you aren't? Sam? It's a vicious lie, Jacob! 




Don't let him tell you that!" I was suddenly yelling again. 

Jacob's face went hard and flat. "No one had to tell me anything. I know what I am." 

"You're my friend, that's what you are! Jake-don't!" 

He was backing away from me. 

"I'm sorry, Bella," he said again; this time it was a broken mumble. He turned and almost ran 
into the house. 

I was unable to move from where I stood. I stared at the little house; it looked too small to 
hold four large boys and two larger men. There was no reaction inside. No flutter at the edge 
of the curtain, no sound of voices or movement. It faced me vacantly. 

The rain started to drizzle, stinging here and there against my skin. I couldn't take my eyes 
off the house. Jacob would come back. He had to. 

The rain picked up, and so did the wind. The drops were no longer falling from above; they 
slanted at an angle from the west. I could smell the brine from the ocean. My hair whipped in 
my face, sticking to the wet places and tangling in my lashes. I waited. 

Finally the door opened, and I took a step forward in relief. 

Billy rolled his chair into the door frame. I could see no one behind him. 

"Charlie just called, Bella. I told him you were on your way home." His eyes were full of pity. 

The pity made it final somehow. I didn't comment. I just turned robotically and climbed in 
my truck. I'd left the windows open and the seats were slick and wet. It didn't matter. I was 
already soaked. 

Not as bad! Not as bad\ my mind tried to comfort me. It was true. This wasn't as bad. This 
wasn't the end of the world, not again. This was just the end of what little peace there was 
left behind. That was all. 

Not as bad, I agreed, then added, but bad enough. 

I'd thought Jake had been healing the hole in me-or at least plugging it up, keeping it from 
hurting me so much. I'd been wrong. He'd just been carving out his own hole, so that I was 
now riddled through l ik e Swiss cheese. I wondered why I didn't crumble into pieces. 

Charlie was waiting on the porch. As I rolled to a stop, he walked out to meet me. 

"Billy called. He said you got in fight with Jake-said you were pretty upset," he explained as 
he opened my door for me. 



Then he looked at my face. A kind of horrified recognition registered in his expression. I tried 




to feel my face from the inside out, to know what he was seeing. My face felt empty and 
cold, and I realized what it would remind h im of. 

"That's not exactly how it happened," I muttered. 

Charlie put his arm around me and helped me out of the car. He didn't comment on my 
sodden clothes. 

"Then what did happen'" he asked when we were inside. He pulled the afghan off the back 
of the sofa as he spoke and wrapped it around my shoulders. I realized I was shivering still. 

My voice was lifeless. "Sam Uley says Jacob can't be my friend anymore." 

Charlie shot me a strange look. "Who told you that?" 

"Jacob," I stated, though that wasn't exactly what he'd said. It was still true. 

Charlie's eyebrows pulled together. "You really think there's something wrong with the Uley 
kid?" 

"I know there is. Jacob wouldn't tell me what, though." I could hear the water from my 
clothes dripping to the floor and splashing on the linoleum. "I'm going to go change." 

Charlie was lost in thought. "Okay," he said absently. 

I decided to take a shower because I was so cold, but the hot water didn't seem to affect the 
temperature of my skin. I was still freezing when I gave up and shut the water off. In the 
sudden quiet, I could hear Charlie talking to someone downstairs. I wrapped a towel around 
me, and cracked the bathroom door. 

Charlie's voice was angry. "I'm not buying that. It doesn't make any sense." 

It was quiet then, and I realized he was on the phone. A minute passed. 

"Don't you put this on Bella!" Charlie suddenly shouted. 

I jumped. When he spoke again, his voice was careful and lower. "Bella's made it very clear 
all along that she and Jacob were just friends... Well, if that was it, then why didn't you say 
so at first? No, Billy, I think she's right about this. . . Because I know my daughter, and if she 
says Jacob was scared before-" He was cut off mid-sentence, and when he answered he was 
almost shouting again. 

"What do you mean I don't know my daughter as well as I think I do!" He listened for a brief 
second, and his response was almost too low for me to hear. "If you think I'm going to 
remind her about that, then you had better think again. She's only just starting to get over it, 
and mostly because of Jacob, I think. If whatever Jacob has going on with this Sam character 
sends her back into that depression, then Jacob is going to have to answer to me. You're my 




friend, Billy, but this is hurting my family." 

There was another break for Billy to respond. 

"You got that right-those boys set one toe out of line and I'm going to know about it. We'll 
be keeping an eye on the situation, you can be sure of that." He was no longer Charlie; he 
was Chief Swan now. 

"Fine. Yeah. Goodbye." The phone slammed into the cradle. 

I tiptoed quickly across the hall into my room. Charlie was muttering angrily in the kitchen. 

So Billy was going to blame me. I was leading Jacob on and he'd finally had enough. 

It was strange, for I'd feared that myself, but after the last thing Jacob had said this 
afternoon, I didn't believe it anymore. There was much more to this than an unrequited crush, 
and it surprised me that Billy would stoop to claiming that. It made me think that whatever 
secret they were keeping was bigger than I'd been imagining. At least Charlie was on my side 
now. 

I put my pajamas on and crawled into bed. Life seemed dark enough at the moment chat I let 
myself cheat. The hole-holes now-were already aching, so why not? I pulled out the 
memory-nor a real memory that would hurt too much, but the false memory of Edward's 
voice in my mind this afternoon-and played it over and over in my head until I fell asleep 
with the tears still streaming calmly down my empty face. 

It was a new dream tonight. Rain was falling and Jacob was walking soundlessly beside me, 
though beneath my feet the ground crunched l ik e dry gravel. But he wasn't my Jacob; he was 
the new, bitter, graceful Jacob. The smooth suppleness of his walk reminded me of someone 
else, and, as I watched, his features started to change. The russet color of his skin leached 
away, leaving his face pale white like bone. His eyes turned gold, and then crimson, and then 
back to gold again. His shorn hair twisted in the breeze, turning bronze where the wind 
touched it. And his face became so beautiful that it shattered my heart. I reached for him, but 
he took a step away, raising his hands l ik e a shield. And then Edward vanished. 

I wasn't sure, when I woke in the dark, if I'd just begun crying, or if my tears had run while I 
slept and simply continued now. I stared at my dark ceiling. I could feel that it was the 
middle of the night-I was still half-asleep, maybe more than half. I closed my eyes wearily 
and prayed for a dreamless sleep. 

That's when I heard the noise that must have wakened me in the first place. Something sharp 
scraped along the length of my window with a high-pitched squeal, like fingernails against 
the glass. 




12. INTRUDER 



MY EYES FLEW WIDE OPEN WITH FRIGHT, THOUGH I WAS so exhausted and 
muddled that I was not yet positive whether I was awake or asleep. 

Something scratched against my window again with the same thin, high-pitched sound. 

Confused and clumsy with sleep, I stumbled out of my bed and to the window, blinking the 
lingering tears from my eyes on the way. 

A huge, dark shape wobbled erratically on the other side of the glass, lurching toward me like 
it was going to smash right through. I staggered back, terrified, my throat closing around a 
scream. 

Victoria. 

She'd come for me. 

I was dead. 

Not Charlie, too! 

I choked back the building scream. I would have to keep quiet through this. Somehow. I had 
to keep Charlie from coming to investigate. . . 

And then a familiar, husky voice called from the dark shape. 

"Bella!" it hissed. "Ouch! Damn it, open the window! OUCH!" 

I needed two seconds to shake off the horror before I could move, but then I hurried to the 
window and shoved the glass out of the way. The clouds were dimly lit from behind, enough 
for me to make sense of the shapes. 

"What are you doing?" I gasped. 

Jacob was clinging precariously to the top of the spruce that grew in the middle of Charlie's 
little front yard. His weight had bowed the tree toward the house and he now swung-his legs 
dangling twenty feet above the ground-not a yard away from me. The thin branches at the 
tip of the tree scraped against the side of the house again with a grating squeal. 

"I'm trying to keep"-he huffed, shifting his weight as the treetop bounced him-"my promise!" 

I blinked my wet blurry eyes, suddenly sure that I was dreaming. 

"When did you ever promise to kill yourself falling out of Charlie's tree?" 

He snorted, unamused, swinging his legs to improve his balance. "Get out of the way," he 
ordered. 




'What?' 



He swung his legs again, backwards and forward, increasing his momentum. I realized what 
he was ttying to do. 

"No, Jake!" 

But I ducked to the side, aecause it was too late. With a grunt, he launched himself toward 
my open window. 

Another scream built in my throat as I waited for him to fall to his death-or at least maim 
himself against the wooden siding. To my shock, he swung agilely into my room, landing on 
the balls of his feet with a low thud. 

We both looked to the door automatically, holding our breath, waiting to see if the noise had 
woken Charlie. A short moment of silence passed, and then we heard the muffled sound of 
Charlie's snore. 

A wide grin spread slowly across Jacob's face; he seemed extremely pleased with himself. It 
wasn't the grin that I knew and loved-it was a new grin, one that was a bitter mockery of his 
old sincerity, on the new face that belonged to Sam. 

That was a bit much for me. 

I'd cried myself to sleep over this boy. His harsh rejection had punched a painful new hole in 
what was left of my chest. He'd left a new nightmare behind him, l ik e an infection in a 
sore-the insult after the injury. And now he was here in my room, smirking at me as if none 
of that had passed. Worse than that, even though his arrival had been noisy and awkward, it 
reminded me of when Edward used to sneak in through my window at night, and the 
reminder picked viciously at the unhealed wounds. 

All of this, coupled with the fact that I was dog-tired, did not put me in a friendly mood. 

"Get out!" I hissed, putting as much venom into the whisper as I could. 

He blinked, his face going blank with surprise. 

"No," he protested. "I came to apologize." 

"I don't accept !" 

I tried to shove him back out the window-after all, if this was a dream, it wouldn't really hurt 
him. It was useless, though. I didn't budge him an inch. I dropped my hands quickly, and 
stepped away from him. 

He wasn't wearing a shirt, though the air blowing in the window was cold enough to make 
me shiver, and it made me uncomfortable to have my hands on his bare chest. His skin was 




burning hot, l ik e his head had been the last time I'd touched him. Like he was still sick with 
the fever. 

He didn't look sick. He looked huge. He leaned over me, so big that he blacked out the 
window, tongue-tied by my furious reaction. 

Suddenly, it was just more than I could handle-it felt as if all of my sleepless nights were 
crashing down on me en masse. I was so brutally tired that I thought I might collapse right 
there on the floor. I swayed unsteadily, and struggled to keep my eyes open. 

"Bella?" Jacob whispered anxiously. He caught my elbow as I swayed again, and steered me 
back to the bed. My legs gave out when I reached the edge, and I plopped into a limp heap 
on the mattress. 

"Hey, are you okay?" Jacob asked, worry creasing his forehead. 

I looked up at him, the tears not yet dried on my cheeks. "Why in the world would I be okay, 
Jacob?" 

Anguish replaced some of the bitterness in his face. "Right," he agreed, and took a deep 
breath. "Crap. Well... I-I'm so sorry, Bella." The apology was sincere, no doubt about it, 
though there was still an angry twist to his features. 

"Why did you come here? I don't want apologies from you, Jake." 

"I know," he whispered. "But I couldn't leave things the way I did this afternoon. Thar was 
horrible. I'm sorry." 

I shook my head wearily. "I don't understand anything." 

"I know. I want to explain-" He broke off suddenly, his mouth open, almost l ik e something 
had cut off his air. Then he sucked in a deep breath. "But I can't explain," he said, still angry. 
"I wish I could." 

I let my head fall into my hands. My question came out muffled by my arm. "Why?" 

He was quiet for a moment. I twisted my head to the side-too tired to hold it up-to see his 
expression. It surprised me. His eyes were squinted, his teeth clenched, his forehead wrinkled 
in effort. 

"What's wrong?" I asked. 

He exhaled heavily, and I realized he'd been holding his breath, too. "I can't do it," he 
muttered, frustrated. 

"Do what?" 



He ignored my question. "Look, Bella, haven't you ever had a secret that you couldn't tell 




anyone?' 



He looked at me with knowing eyes, and my thoughts jumped immediately to the Cullens. I 
hoped my expression didn't look guilty. 

"Something you felt like you had to keep from Charlie, from your mom. . . ?" he pressed. 
"Something you won't even talk about with me? Not even now?" 

I felt my eyes tighten. I didn't answer his question, though I knew he would take that as a 
confirmation. 

"Can you understand that I might have the same kind of... situation?" He was struggling 
again, seeming to fight for the right words. "Sometimes, loyalty gets in the way of what you 
want to do. Sometimes, it's not your secret to tell." 

So, I couldn't argue with that. He was exactly right— I had a secret that wasn't mine to tell, 
yet a secret I felt bound to protect. A secret that, suddenly, he seemed to know all about. 

I still didn't see how it applied to him, or Sam, or Billy. What was it to them, now that the 
Cullens were gone? 

"I don't know why you came here, Jacob, if you were just going to give me riddles instead of 
answers." 

"I'm sorry," he whispered. "This is so frustrating." 

We looked at each other for a long moment in the dark room, both our faces hopeless. 

"The part that kills me," he said abruptly, "is that you already know. I already told yon 
everything!" 

"What are you talking about?" 

He sucked in a startled breath, and then leaned toward me, his face shifting from 
hopelessness to blazing intensity in a second. He stared fiercely into my eyes, and his voice 
was fast and eager. He spoke the words right into my face; his breath was as hot as his skin. 

"I think I see a way to make this work out-because you know this, Bella! I can't tell you, but 
if you guessed it! That would let me right off the hook!" 

"You want me to guess? Guess what?' 

" My secret! You can do it-you know the answer!" 

I blinked twice, trying to clear my head. I was so tired. Nothing he said made sense. 

He took in my blank expression, and then his face tensed with effort again. "Hole on, let me 
see if I give you some help," he said. Whatever he was trying to do, it was so hard he was 




panting. 

"Help?" I asked, trying to keep up. My lids wanted to slip closed, but I forced them open. 
"Yeah," he said, breathing hard. "Like clues." 

He took my face in his enormous, too-warm hands and held it just a few inches from his. He 
stared into my eyes while he whispered, as if to communicate something besides the words 
he spoke. 

"Remember the first day we met-on the beach in La Push?" 

"Of course I do." 

"Tell me about it." 

I took a deep breath and tried to concentrate. "You asked about my truck. . . " 

He nodded, urging me on. 

"We talked about the Rabbit..." 

"Keep going." 

"We went for a walk down the beach. . . " My cheeks were growing warm under his palms as I 
remembered, but he wouldn't notice, hot as his s ki n was. I'd asked him to walk with me, 
flirting ineptly but successfully, in order to pump him for information. 

He was nodding, anxious for more. 

My voice was nearly soundless. "You told me scary stories... Quileute legends." 

He closed his eyes and opened them again. "Yes." The word was tense, fervent, like he was 
on the edge of something vital. He spoke slowly, making each word distinct. "Do you 
remember what I said?" 

Even in the dark, he must be able to see the change in the color of my face. How could I ever 
forget that? Without realizing what he was doing, Jacob had told me exactly what I needed 
to know that day-that Edward was a vampire. 

He looked at me with eyes that knew too much. "Think hard," he told me. 

"Yes, I remember," I breathed. 

He inhaled deeply, struggling. "Do you remember all the stor-" He couldn't finish the 
question. His mouth popped open l ik e something had stuck in his throat. 



'All the stories?" I asked. 




He nodded mutely. 



My head churned. Only one story really mattered. I knew he'd begun with others, but I 
couldn't remember the inconsequential prelude, especially not while my brain was so clouded 
with exhaustion. I started to shake my head. 

Jacob groaned and jumped off the bed. He pressed his fists against his forehead and breathed 
fast and angry. "You know this, you know this," he muttered to himself. 

"Jake? Jake, please, I'm exhausted. I'm no good at this right now. Maybe in the morning. . . " 

He took a steadying breath and nodded. "Maybe it will come back to you. I guess I 
understand why you only remember the one story," he added in a sarcastic, bitter tone. He 
plunked back onto the mattress beside me. "Do you mind if I ask you a question about that?" 
he asked, still sarcastic. "I've been dying ro know." 

"A question about what?" I asked warily. 

"About the vampire story I told you." 

I stared at him with guarded eyes, unable to answer. He asked his question anyway. 

"Did you honestly not know?" he asked me, his voice turning husky. "Was I the one who told 
you what he was?" 

How did he know this ? Why did he decide to believe, why now ? My teeth clenched together. 
I stared back at him, no intention of speaking. He could see that. 

"See what I mean about loyalty?" he murmured, even huskier now. "It's the same for me, only 
worse. You can't imagine how tight I'm bound. . ." 

I didn't l ik e that-didn't l ik e the way his eyes closed as if he were in pain when he spoke of 
being bound. More than dislike-I realized I hated it, hated anything that caused him pain. 
Hated it fiercely. 

Sam's face filled my mind. 

For me, this was all essentially voluntary. I protected the Cullens' secret out of love; 
unrequited, but true. For Jacob, it didn't seem to be that way. 

"Isn't there any way for you to get free?" I whispered, touching the rough edge at the back of 
his shorn hair. 

His hands began to tremble, but he didn't open his eyes. "No. I'm in this for life. A life 
sentence." A bleak laugh. "Longer, maybe." 

"No, Jake," I moaned. "What if we ran away? Just you and me. What if we left home, and 




left Sam behind? 



"It's not something I can run away from, Bella," he whispered. "I would run with you, 
though, if I could." His shoulders were shaking now, too. He took a deep breath. "Look, I've 
got to leave." 

"Why?" 

"For one thing, you look like you're going to pass out at any second. You need your sleep-I 
need you firing on all pistons. You're going to figure this out, you have to." 

"And why else?" 

He frowned. "I had to sneak out-I'm not supposed to see you. They've got to be wondering 
where I am." His mouth twisted. "I suppose I should go let them know." 

"You don't have to tell them anything," I hissed. 

"Ah the same, I will." 

The anger flashed hot inside me. "I hate them!" 

Jacob looked at me with wide eyes, surprised. "No, Bella. Don't hate the guys. It's not Sam's 
or any of the others' faults. I told you before-it's me. Samis actually... well, incredibly cool. 
Jared and Paul are great, too, though Paul is kind of... And Embry's always been my friend. 
Nothing's changed there-the only thing that hasn't changed. I feel really bad abour the things 
I used to think about Sam. . . " 

"Sam was incredibly cool." I glared at him in disbelief, but let it go. 

"Then why aren't you supposed to see me?" I demanded. 

"It's not safe," he mumbled looking down. 

His words sent a thrill of fear through me. 

Did he know that, too? Nobody knew that besides me. But he was right-it was the middle of 
the night, the perfect time for hunting. Jacob shouldn't be here in my room. If someone came 
for me, I had :o be alone. 

"If I thought it was too... too risky," he whispered, "I wouldn't have come. But Bella," he 
looked at me again, "I made you a promise. I had no idea it would be so hard to keep, but 
that doesn't mean I'm not going to try." 

He saw the incomprehension in my face. "After that stupid movie," he reminded me. "I 
promised you that I wouldn't ever hurt you. . . So I really blew it this afternoon, didn't I?" 

"I know you didn't want to do it, Jake. It's okay." 




"Thanks, Bella." He took my hand. "I'm going to do what I can to be here for you, just l ik e I 
promised." He grinned at me suddenly. The grin was not mine, nor Sam's, but some strange 
combination of the two. "It would really help if you could figure this out on your own, Bella. 
Put some honest effort into it." 

I made a weak grimace. "I'll try." 

"And I'll try to see you soon." He sighed. "And they'll try to talk me out of that." 

"Don't listen to them." 

"I'll try." He shook his head, as if he doubted his success. "Come and tell me as soon as you 
figure it out." Something occurred to him just then, something that made his hands shake. "If 
you... if you want to." 

"Why wouldn't I want to see you?" 

His face turned hard and bitter, one hundred percent the face that belonged to Sam. "Oh, I 
can think of a reason," he said in a harsh tone. "Look, I really have to go. Could you do 
something for me?" 

I just nodded, frightened of the change in him. 

"At least call me-if you don't want to see me again. Let me know if it's l ik e that." 

"That won't happen-" 

He raised one hand, cutting me off. "Just let me know." 

He stood and headed for the window. 

"Don't be an idiot, Jake," I complained. "You'll break your leg. Use the door. Charlie's not 
going to catch you." 

"I won't get hurt," he muttered, but he turned for the door. He hesitated as he passed me, 
staring at me with an expression l ik e something was stabbing him. He held one hand out, 
pleading. 

I took his hand, and suddenly he yanked me-too roughly-right off the bed so that I thudded 
against his chest. 

"Just in case," he muttered against my hair, crushing me in a bear hug that about broke my 
ribs. 

"Can't-breathe!" I gasped. 

He dropped me at once, keeping one hand at my waist so I didn't fall over. He pushed me, 
more gently this time, back down on the bed. 




"Get some sleep, Bells. You've got to get your head working. I know you can do this. I need 
you. to understand. I won't lose you, Bella. Not for this." 

He was to the door in one stride, opening it quietly, and then disappearing through it. I 
listened for him to hit the squeaky step in the stairs, but there was no sound. 

I lay back on my bed, my head spinning. I was too confused, too worn out. I closed my eyes, 
trying to make sense of it, only to be swallowed up by unconsciousness so swiftly that it was 
disorienting. 

It was not the peaceful, creamless sleep I'd yearned for-of course not. I was in the forest 
again, and I started to wander the way I always did. 

I quickly became aware that this was not the same dream as usual. For one thing, I felt no 
compulsion to wander or to search; I was merely wandering out of habit, because that was 
what was usually expected of me here. Actually, this wasn't even the same forest. The smell 
was different, and the light, too. It smelled, not like the damp earth of the woods, but l ik e the 
brine of the ocean. I couldn't see the sky; still, it seemed l ik e the sun must be shining-the 
leaves above were bright jade green. 

This was the forest around La Push-near the beach there, I was sure of it. I knew that if I 
found the beach, I would be able to see the sun, so I hurried forward, following the faint 
sound of waves in the distance. 

And then Jacob was there. He grabbed my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of 
the forest. 

"Jacob, what's wrong?" I asked. His face was the frightened face of a boy, and his hair was 
beautiful again, swept back into a ponytail on the nape of his neck. He yanked with all his 
strength, but I resisted; I didn't want to go into the dark. 

"Run, Bella, you have to run!" he whispered, terrified. 

The abrupt wave of deja vu was so strong it nearly woke me up. 

I knew why I recognized this place now. It was because I'd been here before, in another 
dream. A million years ago, part of a different life entirely. This was the dream I'd had the 
night after I'd walked with Jacob on the beach, the first night I knew that Edward was a 
vampire. Reliving that day with Jacob must have dredged this dream out of my buried 
memories. 

Detached from the dream now, I waited for it to play out. A light was coming toward me 
from the beach. In just a moment, Edward would walk through the trees, his skin faintly 
glowing and his eyes black and dangerous. He would beckon to me, and smile. He would be 
beautiful as an angel, and his teeth would be pointed and sharp. . . 




But I was getting ahead of myself. Something else had to happen first. 

Jacob dropped my hand and yelped. Shaking and twitching, he fell to the ground at my feet. 
"Jacob!" I screamed, but he was gone. 

In his place was an enormous, red-brown wolf with dark, intelligent eyes. 

The dream veered off course, l ik e a train jumping the tracks. 

This was not the same wolf that I'd dreamed of in another life. This was the great russet wolf 
I'd stood half a foot from in the meadow, just a week ago. This wolf was gigantic, 
monstrous, bigger than a bear. 

This wolf stared intently at me, trying to convey something vital with his intelligent eyes. 
The black-brown, familiar eyes of Jacob Black. 

I woke screaming at the top of my lungs. 

I almost expected Charlie to come check on me this time. This wasn't my usual screaming. I 
buried my head in my pillow and tried to muffle the hysterics that my screams were building 
into. J pressed the cotton tight against my face, wondering if I couldn't also somehow 
smother the connection I'd just made. 

But Charlie didn't come in. and eventually I was able to strangle the strange screeching 
coming out of my throat. 

I remembered it all now-every word that Jacob had said to me that day on the beach, even 
the part before he got to the vampires, the "cold ones." Especially that first part. 

" Do you know any of our old stories, about where we came from-the Quileutes, / mean?" he 
asked. 

"Not really, " / admitted. 

"Well, there are lots of legends, some of them claiming to date back to the Flood-supposedly, 
the ancient Quileutes tied their canoes to the tops of the tallest trees on the mountain to 
surx’ive, like Noah and the ark. " He smiled then, to show me how little stock he put in the 
histories. "Another legend claims that we descended from wolves-and that the wolves are our 
brothers still. It's against tribcd law to kill them. 

"Then there are the stories about the cold ones. " His voice dropped a little lower. 

"The cold ones?" 

"Yes. There are stories of the cold ones as old as the wolf legends, and some much more 
recent. According to legend, my own great-grandfather knew some of them. He was the one 




who made the treaty that kept them off our land. " Jacob rolled his eyes. 

" Your great-grandfather?" 

"He was a tribal elder, like my father. You see, the cold ones are the natural enemies of the 
wolf-well, not the wolf really, but the wolves that turn into men, like our ancestors. You would 
call them werewolves." 

"Werewolves have enemies?" 

"Only one. " 

There was something stuck in my throat, choking me. I tried to swallow it down, but it was 
lodged there, un-moving. I tried to spit it out. 

"Werewolf," I gasped. 

Yes, that was the word that I was choking on. 

The whole world lurched, tilting the wrong way on its axis. 

What kind of a place was this? Could a world really exist where ancient legends went 
wandering around the borders of tiny, insignificant towns, facing down mythical monsters? 
Did this mean every impossible fairy tale was grounded somewhere in absolute truth? Was 
there anything sane or normal at all, or was everything just magic and ghost stories? 

I clutched my head in my hands, trying to keep it from exploding. 

A small, dry voice in the back of my mind asked me what the big deal was. Hadn't I already 
accepted the existence of vampires long ago-and without all the hysterics that time? 

Exactly, I wanted to scream back at the voice. Wasn't one myth enough for anyone, enough 
for a lifetime? 

Besides, there'd never been one moment that I wasn't completely aware that Edward Cullen 
was above and beyond the ordinary. It wasn't such a surprise to find out what he 
was-because he so obviously was something. 

But Jacob? Jacob, who was just Jacob, and nothing more than that? Jacob, my friend? Jacob, 
the only human I'd ever been able to relate to . . . 

And he wasn't even human. 

I fought the urge to scream again. 

What did this say about me? 

I knew the answer to that one. It said that there was something deeply wrong with me. Why 




else would my life be filled with characters from horror movies? Why else would I care so 
much about them that it would tear big chunks right out of my chest when they went off 
along their mythical ways? 

In my head, everything spun and shifted, rearranging so that things that had meant one thing 
before, now meant something else. 

There was no cult. There had never been a cult, never been a gang. No, it was much worse 
than that. It was a pack. 

A pack of five mind-blowingly gigantic, multihued werewolves that had stalked right past 
me in Edward's meadow. . . 

Suddenly, I was in a frantic hurry. I glanced at the clock-it was way too early and I didn't 
care. I had to go to La Push now. I had to see Jacob so he could tell me that I hadn't lost my 
mind altogether. 

I pulled on the first clean clothes I could find, not bothering to be sure they matched, and 
took the stairs two at a time. I almost ran into Charlie as I skidded into the hallway, headed 
for the door. 

"Where are you going?" he asked, as surprised to see me as I was to see him. "Do you know 
what time it is?" 

"Yeah. I have to go see Jacob." 

"I thought the thing with Sam-" 

"That doesn't matter, I have to talk to him right now." 

"It's pretty early." He frowned when my expression didn't change. "Don't you want 
breakfast?" 

"Not hungry." The words flew through my lips. He was blocking my path to the exit. I 
considered ducking around him and making a run for it, but I knew I would have to explain 
that to him later. "I'll be back soon, okay?" 

Charlie frowned. "Straight to Jacob's house, right? No stops on the way?" 

"Of course not, where would I stop?" My words were running together in my hurry. 

"I don't know," he admitted. "It's just... well, there's been another attack-the wolves again. 
It was real close to the resort by the hot springs-there's a witness this time. The victim was 
only a dozen yards from the road when he disappeared. His wife saw a huge gray wolf just a 
few minutes later, while she was searching for him, and ran for help." 



My stomach dropped l ik e I'd hit a corkscrew on a roller coaster. "A wolf attacked h im ?' 




"There's no sign of him-just a little blood again." Charlie's face was pained. "The rangers are 
going out armed, taking armed volunteers. There're a lot of hunters who are eager to be 
involved-there's a reward being offered for wolf carcasses. That's going to mean a lot of 
firepower out there in the forest, and it worries me." He shook his head. "When people get 
too excited, accidents happen..." 

"They're going to shoot the wolves?" My voice shot through three octaves. 

"What else can we do? What's wrong?" he asked, his tense eyes studying my face. I felt faint; 
I must be whiter than usual. "You aren't turning into a tree-hugger on me, are you?" 

I couldn't answer. If he hadn't been watching me, I would have put my head between my 
knees. I'd forgotten about the missing hikers, the bloody paw prints... I hadn't connected 
those facts to my first realization. 

"Look, honey, don't let this scare you. Just stay in town or on the highway-no stops-okay?" 
"Okay," I repeated in a weak voice. 

"I've got to go." 

I looked at him closely for the first time, and saw that he had his gun strapped to his waist 
and hiking boots on. 

"You aren't going out there after the wolves, are you, Dad?" 

"I've got to help. Bells. People are disappearing." 

My voice shot up again, almost hysterical now. "No! No, don't go. It's too dangerous!" 

"I've got to do my job, kid. Don't be such a pessimist-I'll be fine." He turned for the door, 
and held it open. "You leaving?" 

I hesitated, my stomach still spinning in uncomfortable loops. What could I say to stop him? I 
was too dizzy to think of a solution. 

"Bells?" 

"Maybe it's too early to go to La Push," I whispered. 

"I agree," he said, and he stepped out into the rain, shutting the door behind him. 

As soon as he was out of sight, I dropped to the floor and put my head between my knees. 
Should I go after Charlie? What would I say? 

And what about Jacob? Jacob was my best friend; I needed to warn him. If he really was a-I 
cringed and forced myself to think the word-werewolf (and I knew it was true, I could feel 




it), then people would be shooting at him! I needed to tell him and his friends that people 
would try to kill them if they went running around like gigantic wolves. I needed to tell them 
to stop. 

They had to stop! Charlie was out there in the woods. Would they care about that? I 
wondered. . . Up until now, only strangers had disappeared. Did that mean anything, or was it 
just chance? 

I needed to believe that Jacob, at least, would care about that. 

Either way, I had to warn him. 

Or... did I? 

Jacob was my best friend, but was he a monster, too? A real one? A bad one? Should I warn 
him, if he and his friends were... were murderers l If they were out slaughtering innocent 
hikers in cold blood? If they were truly creatures from a horror movie in every sense, would it 
be wrong to protect them? 

It was inevitable that I would have to compare Jacob and his friends to the Cullens. I 
wrapped my arms around my chest, fighting the hole, while I thought of them. 

I didn't know anything about werewolves, clearly. I would have expected something closer 
to the movies-big hairy half-men creatures or something-if I'd expected anything at all. So I 
didn't know what made them hunt, whether hunger or thirst or just a desire to kill. It was 
hard to judge, not knowing that. 

But it couldn't be worse than what the Cullens endured in their quest to be good. I thought 
of Esme-the tears started when I pictured her kind, lovely face-and how, as motherly and 
loving as she was, she'd had to hold her nose, all ashamed, and run from me when I was 
bleeding. It couldn't be harder than that. I thought of Carlisle, the centuries upon centuries 
that he had struggled to teach himself to ignore blood, so that he could save lives as a doctor. 
Nothing could be harder than that. 

The werewolves had chosen a different path. 

Now, what should l choose? 




1 3 . KILLER 



IF IT WAS ANYONE BUT JACOB , I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, shaking my head as I 
drove down the forest-lined highway to La Push. 

I still wasn't sure if I was domg the right thing, but I'd made a compromise with myself. 

I couldn't condone what Jacob and his friends, his pack, were doing. I understood now what 
he'd said last night-that I might not want to see him again-and I could have called him as 
he'd suggested, but that felt cowardly. I owed him a face-to-face conversation, at least. I 
would tell him to his face that I couldn't just overlook what was going on. I couldn't be 
friends with a ki ller and say nothing, let the killing continue... That would make me a 
monster, too. 

But I couldn't not warn him, either. I had to do what I could to protect him. 

I pulled up to the Blacks' house with my lips pressed together into a hard line. It was bad 
enough that my best friend was a werewolf. Did he have to be a monster, too? 

The house was dark, no lights in the windows, but I didn't care if I woke them. My fist 
thudded against the front door with angry energy; the sound reverberated through the walls. 

"Come in," I heard Billy call after a minute, and a light flicked on. 

I twisted the knob; it was unlocked. Billy was leaning around an open doorway just off the 
little kitchen, a bathrobe around his shoulders, not in his chair yet. When he saw who it was, 
his eyes widened briefly, and then his face turned stoic. 

"Well, good morning, Bella. What are you doing up so early?" 

"Hey, Billy. I need to talk to Jake-where is he?" 

"Urn. . . I don't really know," he lied, straight-faced. 

"Do you know what Charlie is doing this morning?" I demanded, sick of the stalling. 

"Should I?" 

"He and half the other men in town are all out in the woods with guns, hunting giant 
wolves." 

Billy's expression flickered, and then went blank. 

"So I'd like to talk to Jake about that, if you don't mind," I continued. 

Billy pursed his thick lips for a long moment. "I'd bet he's still asleep," he finally said, 
nodding toward the tiny hallway off the front room. "He's out late a lot these days. Kid needs 
his rest-probably you shouldn't wake him." 




"It's my turn," I muttered under my breath as I stalked to the hallway. Billy sighed. 



Jacob's tiny closet of a room was the only door in the yard-long hallway. I didn't bother to 
knock. I threw the door open; it slammed against the wall with a bang. 

Jacob-still wearing just the same black cut-off sweats he'd worn last night-was stretched 
diagonally across the double bed that took up all of his room but a few inches around the 
edges. Even on a slant, it wasn't long enough; his feet hung off the one end and his head off 
the other. He was fast asleep, snoring lightly with his mouth hanging open. The sound of the 
door hadn't even made him twitch. 

His face was peaceful with (deep sleep, all the angry lines smoothed out. There were circles 
under his eyes that I hadn't noticed before. Despite his ridiculous size, he looked very young 
now, and very weary. Pity shook me. 

I stepped back out, and shut the door quietly behind me. 

Billy stared with curious, guarded eyes as I walked slowly back into the front room. 

"I think I'll let him get some rest." 

Billy nodded, and then we gazed at each other for a minute. I was dying to ask him about his 
part in this. 

What did he think of what his son had become? But I knew how he'd supported Sam from 
the very beginning, and so I supposed the murders must not bother him. How he justified 
that to himself I couldn't imagine. 

I could see many questions for me in his dark eyes, but he didn't voice them either. 

"Look," I said, breaking the loud silence. "I'll be down at the beach for a while. When he 
wakes up, tell him I'm waiting for him, okay?" 

"Sure, sure," Billy agreed. 

I wondered if he really would. Well, if he didn't, I'd tried, right? 

I drove down to First Beach and parked in the empty dirt lot. It was still dark-the gloomy 
predawn of a cloudy day-and when I cut the headlights it was hard to see. I had to let my 
eyes adjust before I could find the path that led through the tall hedge of weeds. It was 
colder here, with the wind whipping off the black water, and I shoved my hands deep into 
the pockets of my winter jacket. At least the rain had stopped. 

I paced down the beach toward the north seawall. I couldn't see St. James or the other 
islands, just the vague shape of the water's edge. I picked my way carefully across the rocks, 
watching out for driftwood that might trip me. 




I found what I was looking for before I realized I was looking for it. It materialized out of the 
gloom when it was just a few feet away: a long bone-white driftwood tree stranded deep on 
the rocks. The roots twisted up at the seaward end, l ik e a hundred brittle tentacles. I couldn't 
be sure that it was the same tree where Jacob and I had had our first conversation-a 
conversation that had begun so many different, tangled threads of my life-but it seemed to be 
in about the same place I sat down where I'd sat before, and stared out across the invisible 
sea. 

Seeing Jacob l ik e that-innocent and vulnerable in sleep-had stolen all my revulsion, 
dissolved all my anger. I still couldn't turn a blind sye to what was happening, l ik e Billy 
seemed to, but I couldn't condemn Jacob for it either. Love didn't work that way, I decided. 
Once you cared about a person, it was impossible to be logical about them anymore. Jacob 
was my friend whether he killed people or not. And I didn't know what I was going to do 
about that. 

When I pictured him sleeping so peacefully, I felt an overpowering urge to protect him. 
Completely illogical. 

Illogical or not, I brooded over the memory his peaceful face, trying to come up with some 
answer, some way to shelter him, while the sky slowly turned gray. 

"Hi, Bella." 

Jacob's voice came from the darkness and made me jump. It was soft, almost shy, but I'd 
been expecting some forewarning from the noisy rocks, and so it still startled me. I could see 
his silhouette against the coming sunrise-it looked enormous. 

"Jake?" 

He stood several paces away, shifting his weight from foot to foot anxiously. 

"Billy told me you came by-didn't take you very long, did it? I knew you could figure it out." 
"Yeah, I remember the right story now," I whispered. 

It was quiet for a long moment and, though it was still too dark to see well, my skin prickled 
as if his eyes were searching my face. There must have been enough light for him to read my 
expression, because when he spoke again, his voice was suddenly acidic. 

"You could have just called," he said harshly. 

I nodded. "I know." 

Jacob started pacing along the rocks. If I listened very hard, I could just hear the gentle brush 
of his feet on the rocks behind the sound of the waves. The rocks had clattered l ik e castanets 
for me. 




"Why did you come?" he demanded, not halting his angry stride. 

"I thought it would be better face-to-face." 

He snorted. "Oh, much better." 

"Jacob, I have to warn you-" 

"About the rangers and the hunters? Don't worry about it. We already know." 

"Don't worry about it?" I demanded in disbelief. "Jake, they've got guns! They're setting traps 
and offering rewards and-" 

"We can take care of ourselves," he growled, still pacing. "They're not going to catch 
anything. They're only making it more difficult-they'll start disappearing soon enough, too." 

"Jake!" I hissed. 

"What? It's just a fact." 

My voice was pale with revulsion. "How can you... feel that way? You know these people. 
Charlie's out there!" The thought made my stomach twist. 

He came to an abrupt stop. "What more can we do?" he retorted. 

The sun turned the clouds a slivery pink above us. I could see his expression now; it was 
angry, frustrated, betrayed. 

"Could you. . . well, try to not be a. . . werewolf?" I suggested in a whisper. 

He threw his hands up in the air. "Like I have a choice about it!" he shouted. "And how 
would that help anything, if you're worried about people disappearing?" 

"I don't understand you." 

He glared at me, his eyes narrowing and his mouth twisting into a snarl. "You know what 
makes me so mad I could just spit?" 

I flinched away from his hostile expression. He seemed to be waiting for an answer, so I 
shook my head. 

"You're such a hypocrite, Bella-there you sit, terrified of me! How is that fair?" His hands 
shook with anger. 

" Hypocrite ? How does being afraid of a monster make me a hypocrite?" 

"Ugh!" he groaned, pressing his trembling fists to his temples and squeezing his eyes shut. 
"Would you listen to yourself?" 




'What?' 



He took two steps toward me, leaning over me and glaring with fury. "Well, I'm so sorry that 
I can't be the right kind of monster for you, Bella. I guess I'm just not as great as a 
bloodsucker, am I?" 

I jumped to my feet and glared back. "No, you're not!" I shouted. "It's not what you are , 
stupid, it's what you do\" 

"What's that supposed to mean?" He roared, his entire frame quivering with rage. 

I was taken entirely by surprise when Edward's voice cautioned me. "Be very careful, Bella," 
his velvet voice warned. "Don't push him too far. You need to calm h im down." 

Even the voice in my head was making no sense today. 

I listened to him, though. I would do anything for that voice. 

"Jacob," I pleaded, making my tone soft and even. "Is it really necessary to kill people, Jacob? 
Isn't there some other way? I mean, if vampires can find a way to survive without murdering 
people, couldn't you give it a try, too?" 

He straightened up with a jerk, l ik e my words had sent an electric shock through him. His 
eyebrows shot up and his eyes stared wide. 

"Killing people?" he demanded. 

"What did you think we were talking about?" 

He wasn't trembling anymore. He looked at me with half-hopeful disbelief. "I thought we 
were talking about your disgust for werewolves." 

"No, Jake, no. It's not that you're a. . . wolf. That's fine," I promised him, and I knew as I said 
the words that I meant them. I really didn't care if he turned into a big wolf-he was still 
Jacob. "If you could just find a way not to hurt people... that's all that upsets me. These ate 
innocent people, Jake, people like Charlie, and I can't just look the other way while you-" 

"Is that all? Really?" he interrupted me, a smile breaking across his face. "You're just scared 
because I'm a murderer? That's the only reason?" 

"Isn't that reason enough?" 

He started to laugh. 

"Jacob Black, this is so not funny!" 

"Sure, sure," he agreed, still chortling. 




He took one long stride and caught me in another vice-tight bear hug. 

"You really, honestly don't mind that I morph into a giant dog?" he asked, his voice joyful in 
my ear. 

"No," I gasped. "Can't-breathe-Jake!" 

He let me go, but took both my hands. "I'm not a killer, Bella." 

I studied his face, and it was clear that this was the truth. Relief pulsed through me. 

"Really?" I asked. 

"Really," he promised solemnly. 

I threw my arms around him. It reminded me of that first day with the motorcycles-he was 
bigger, though, and I felt even more like a child now. 

Like that other time, he stroked my hair. 

"Sorry I called you a hypocrite," he apologized. 

"Sorry I called you a murderer." 

He laughed. 

I thought of something then, and pulled away from him so that I could see his face. My 
eyebrows furrowed in anxiety. "What about Sam? And the others?" 

He shook his head, smiling l ik e a huge burden had been removed from his shoulders. "Of 
course not. Don't you remember what we call ourselves?" 

The memory was clear-I'd just been thinking of that very day. "Protectors?" 

"Exactly." 

"But I don't understand. What's happening in the woods? The missing hikers, the blood?" 

His face was serious, worried at once. "We're trying to do our job, Bella. We're trying to 
protect them, but we're always just a little too late." 

"Protect them from what? Is there really a bear out there, too?" 

"Bella, honey, we only protect people from one thing-our one enemy. It's the reason we 
exist-because they do." 

I stared at him blankly for one second before I understood. Then the blood drained from my 
face and a thin, wordless cry of horror broke through my lips. 




He nodded. "I thought you, of all people, would reali2e what was really going on. 



"Laurent," I whispered. "He's still here." 

Jacob blinked twice, and cocked his head to one side. "Who's Laurent?" 

I tried to sort out the chaos in my head so that I could answer. "You know-you saw him in 
the meadow. You were there..." The words came out in a wondering tone as it all sunk in. 
"You were there, and you kept him from killing me. . ." 

"Oh, the black-haired leech?" He grinned, a tight, fierce grin. "Was that his name?" 

I shuddered. "What were you thinking?" I whispered. "He could have killed you! Jake, you 
don't realize how dangerous-" 

Another laugh interrupted me "Bella, one lone vampire isn't much of a problem for a pack as 
big as ours. It was so easy, it was hardly even fun!" 

"What was so easy?" 

"Killing the bloodsucker who was going to kill you. Now, I don't count that towards the 
whole murder thing," he added quickly. "Vampires don't count as people." 

I could only mouth the words. "You. . . ki lled. . . Laurent?" 

He nodded. "Well, it was a group effort," he qualified. 

"Laurent is dead?" I whispered. 

His expression changed. "You're not upset about that, are you? He was going to kill you-he 
was going for the kill, Bella, we were sure of that before we attacked. You know that, 
right?" 

"I know that. No, I'm not upset-I'm..." I had to sit down. I stumbled back a step until I felt 
the driftwood against my calves, and then sank down onto it. "Laurent is dead. He's not 
coming back for me." 

"You're not mad? He wasn't one of your friends or anything, was he?" 

"My friend?" I stared up at him, confused and dizzy with relief. I started babbling, my eyes 
getting moist. "No, Jake. I'm so... so relieved. I thought he was going to find me-I've been 
waiting for him every night, just hoping that he'd stop with me and leave Charlie alone. I've 
been so frightened, Jacob... But how? He was a vampire! How did you kill him? He was so 
strong, so hard, l ik e marble. . ." 

He sat down next to me and put one big arm around me comfortingly. "It's what we're made 
for. Bells. We're strong, too. I wish you would have told me that you were so afraid. You 




didn't need to be. 



"You weren't around," I mumbled, lost in thought. 

"Oh, right." 

"Wait, Jake-I thought you knew, though. Last night, you said it wasn't safe for you to be in 
my room. I thought you knew that a vampire might be coming. Isn't that what you were 
talking about?" 

He looked confused for a minute, and then he ducked his head. "No, that's not what I 
meant." 

"Then why didn't you think it was safe for you there?" 

He looked at me with guilt-ridden eyes. "I didn't say it wasn't safe for me. I was thinking of 
you." 

"What do you mean?" 

He looked down and kicked a rock. "There's more than one reason I'm not supposed to be 
around you, Bella. I wasn't supposed to tell you our secret, for one thing, but the other part is 
that it's not safe for you. If I get too mad. . . too upset. . . you might get hurt." 

I thought about that carefully. "When you were mad before... when I was yelling at you... 
and you were shaking. . . ?" 

"Yeah." His face dropped even lower. "That was pretty stupid of me. I have to keep a better 
hold on myself. I swore I wasn't going to get mad, no matter what you said to me. But... I 
just got so upser that I was going to lose you. . . that you couldn't deal with what I am. . ." 

"What would happen. . . if you got too mad?" I whispered. 

"I'd turn into a wolf," he whispered back. 

"You don't need a full moon." 

He rolled his eyes. "Hollywood's version doesn't get much right." Then he sighed, and was 
serious again. "You don't need to be so stressed out. Bells. We're going to take care of this. 
And we're keeping a special eye on Charlie and the others-we won't let anything happen to 
him. Trust me on that." 

Something very, very obvious, something I should have grasped at once-but I'd been so 
distracted by the idea of Jacob and his friends fighting with Laurent, that I'd completely 
missed it at the time-occurred to me only then, when Jacob used the present tense again. 



We're going to take care of this. 




It wasn't over. 



"Laurent is dead," I gasped, and my entire body went ice cold. 

"Bella?" Jacob asked anxiously, touching my ashen cheek. 

"If Laurent died. . . a week ago. . . then someone else is killing people now.” 

Jacob nodded; his teeth clenched together, and he spoke through them. "There were two of 
them. We thought his mate would want to fight us-in our stories, they usually get pretty 
pissed off if you kill their mate-but she just keeps running away, and then coming back 
again. If we could figure out what she was after, it would be easier to take her down. But she 
makes no sense. She keeps dancing around the edges, like she's testing our defenses, looking 
for a way in-but in where? Where does she want to go? Sam thinks she's trying to separate 
us, so she'll have a better chance. . ." 

His voice faded until it sounded l ik e it was coming through a long tunnel; I couldn't make 
out the individual words anymore. My forehead dewed with sweat and my stomach rolled 
l ik e I had the stomach flu again. Exactly l ik e I had the flu. 

I turned away from him quickly, and leaned over the tree trunk. My body convulsed with 
useless heaves, my empty stomach contracting with horrified nausea, though there was 
nothing in it to expel. 

Victoria was here. Looking for me. Killing strangers in the woods. The woods where Charlie 
was searching... 

My head spun sickeningly. 

Jacob's hands caught my shoulders-kept me from sliding forward onto the rocks. I could feel 
his hot breath on my cheek. "Bella! What's wrong?" 

"Victoria," I gasped as soon as I could catch my breath around the nauseous spasms. 

In my head, Edward snarled in fury at the name. 

I felt Jacob pull me up from my slump. He draped me awkwardly across his lap, laying my 
limp head against his shoulder. He struggled to balance me, to keep me from sagging over, 
one way or the other He brushed the sweaty hair back from my face. 

"Who?" Jacob asked. "Can you hear me, Bella? Bella?" 

"She wasn't Laurent's mate," I moaned into his shoulder. "They were just old friends. . ." 

"Do you need some water? A doctor? Tell me what to do," he demanded, frantic. 

"I'm not sick-I'm scared," I explained in a whisper. The word scared didn't really seem to 




cover it. 



Jacob patted my back. "Scaled of this Victoria?" I nodded, shuddering. "Victoria is the 
red-haired female?" I trembled again, and whimpered, "Yes." 

"How do you know she wasn't his mate?" 

"Laurent told me James was her mate," I explained, automatically flexing the hand with the 
scar. 

He pulled my face around, holding it steady in his big hand. He stared intently into my eyes. 
"Did he tell you anything else, Bella? This is important. Do you know what she wants?" 

"Of course," I whispered. "She wants me." His eyes flipped wide, then narrowed into slits. 
"Why?" he demanded. 

"Edward killed James," I whispered. Jacob held me so tightly that there was no need for me 
to clutch at the hole-he kept me in one piece. "She did get. . . pissed off. But Laurent said she 
thought it was fairer to kill me than Edward. Mate for mate. She didn't know-still doesn't 
know, I guess-that... that..." I swallowed hard. "That things aren't l ik e that with us 
anymore. Not for Edward, anyway." 

Jacob was distracted by that, his face torn between several different expressions. "Is that 
what happened? Why the Cullens left?" 

"I'm nothing but a human, after all. Nothing special," I explained, shrugging weakly. 

Something l ik e a growl-not a real growl, just a human approximation-rumbled in Jacob's 
chest under my ear. "If that idiot bloodsucker is honestly stupid enough-" 

"Please," I moaned. "Please. Don't." 

Jacob hesitated, then nodded once. 

"This is important," he said again, his face all business now. "This is exactly what we needed 
to know. We've got to tell the others right away." 

He stood, pulling me to my feet. He kept two hands on my waist until he was sure I wasn't 
going to fall. 

"I'm okay," I lied. 

He traded his hold on my waist for one of my hands. "Let's go." 

He pulled me back toward the truck. 

"Where are we going?" I asked. 




"I'm not sure yet," he admitted. "I'll call a meeting. Hey, wait here for just a minute, okay?" 
He leaned me against the side of the truck and released my hand. 

"Where are you going?" 

"I'll be right back," he promised. Then he turned and sprinted through the parking lot, across 
the road, and into the bordering forest. He flitted into the trees, swift and sleek as a deer. 

"Jacob!" I yelled after him hoarsely, but he was already gone. 

It was not a good time to be left alone. Seconds after Jacob was out of sight, I was 
hyperventilating. I dragged myself into the cab of the truck, and mashed the locks down at 
once. It didn't make me feel any better. 

Victoria was already hunting me. It was just luck that she hadn't found me yet-just luck and 
five teenage werewolves. I exhaled sharply. No matter what Jacob said, the thought of h im 
coming anywhere close to Victoria was horrifying. I didn't care what he could turn into when 
he got mad. I could see her in my head, her face wild, her hair l ik e flames, deadly, 
indestructible. . . 

But, according to Jacob, Laurent was gone. Was that really possible? Edward-I clutched 
automatically at my chest-had told me how difficult it was to kill a vampire. Only another 
vampire could do the job. Yet Jake said this was what werewolves were made for. . . 

He said they were keeping a special eye on Charlie-that I should trust the werewolves to 
keep my father safe. How could I trust that? None of us were safe! Jacob the very least of all, 
if he was trying to put himself between Victoria and Charlie. . . between Victoria and me. 

I felt l ik e I might be about to throw up again. 

A sharp rap on the truck's window made me yelp in terror-but it was just Jacob, back 
already. I unlocked the door with trembling, grateful fingers. 

"You're really scared, aren't you?" he asked as he climbed in. 

I nodded. 

"Don't be. We'll take care of you-and Charlie, too. I promise." 

"The idea of you finding Victoria is scarier than the idea of her finding me," I whispered. 

He laughed. "You've got to have a little more confidence in us than that. It's insulting." 

I just shook my head. I'd seen too many vampires in action. 

"Where did you go just now?" I asked. 

He pursed his lips, and said nothing. 




'What? Is it a secret? 



He frowned. "Not really. It's kind of weird, though. I don't want to freak you out." 

"I'm sort of used to weird by this point, you know." I tried to smile without much success. 

Jacob grinned back easily. "Guess you'd have to be. Okay. See, when we're wolves, we 
can. . . hear each other." 

My eyebrows pulled down in confusion. 

"Not hear sounds," he went on, "but we can hear... thoughts -^ ach other's anyway-no matter 
how far away from each other we are. It really helps when we hunt, but it's a big pain 
otherwise. It's embarrassing-having no secrets like that. Freaky, eh?" 

"Is that what you meant last night, when you said you would tell them you'd seen me, even 
though you didn't want to?" 

"You're quick." 

"Thanks." 

"You're also very good with weird. I thought that would bother you." 

"It's not... well, you're not the first person I've known who could do that. So it doesn't seem 
so weird to me." 

"Really?... Wait-are you talking about your bloodsuckers?" 

"I wish you wouldn't call them that." 

He laughed. "Whatever. The Cullens, then?" 

"Just. . . just Edward." I pulled one arm surreptitiously around my torso. 

Jacob looked surprised-unpleasantly so. "I thought those were just stories. I've heard legends 
about vampires who could do. . . extra stuff, but I thought that was just a myth." 

"Is anything just a myth anymore?" I asked him wryly. 

He scowled. "Guess not. Okay, we're going to meet Sam and the others at the place we go to 
ride our bikes." 

I started the truck and headed back up the road. 

"So did you just turn into a wolf now, to talk to Sam?" I asked, curious. 

Jacob nodded, seeming embarrassed. "I kept it real short-I tried not to think about you so 




they wouldn't know what was going on. I was afraid Sam would tell me I couldn't bring 
you." 

"That wouldn't have stopped me." I couldn't get rid of my perception of Sam as the bad guy. 
My teeth clenched together whenever I heard his name. 

"Well, it would have stopped me," Jacob said, morose now. "Remember how I couldn't finish 
my sentences last night? How I couldn't just tell you the whole story?" 

"Yeah. You looked like you were choking on something." 

He chuckled darkly. "Close enough. Sam told me I couldn't tell you. He's... the head of the 
pack, you know. He's the Alpha. When he tells us to do something, or not to do 
something-when he really means it, well, we can't just ignore him." 

"Weird," I muttered. 

"Very," he agreed. "It's kind of a wolf thing." 

"Huh" was the best response I could think of. 

"Yeah, there's a load of stuff like that-wolf things. I'm still learning. I can't imagine what it 
was l ik e for Sam, trying to deal with this alone. It sucks bad enough to go through it with a 
whole pack for support." 

"Sam was alone?" 

"Yeah." Jacob's voice lowered. "When I... changed, it was the most... horrible, the most 
terrifying thing I've ever been through-worse than anything I could have imagined. But I 
wasn't alone-there were the voices there, in my head, telling me what had happened and 
what I had to do. That kept me from losing my mind, I think. But Sam..." He shook his 
head. "Sam had no help." 

This was going to take some adjusting. When Jacob explained it l ik e that, it was hard not to 
feel compassion for Sam. I had to keep reminding myself that there was no reason to hate 
him anymore. 

"Will they be angry that I'm with you?" I asked. 

He made a face. "Probably." 

"Maybe I shouldn't-" 

"No, it's okay," he assured me. "You know a ton of things that can help us. It's not l ik e you're 
just some ignorant human. You're l ik e a... I don't know, spy or something. You've been 
behind enemy lines." 



I frowned to myself. Was that what Jacob would want from me? Insider information to help 




them destroy their enemies? I wasn't a spy, though. I hadn't been collecting that kind of 
information. Already, his words made me feel l ik e a traitor. 

But I wanted him to stop Victoria, didn't I? 

No. 

I did want Victoria to be stopped, preferably before she tortured me to death or ran into 
Charlie or killed another stranger. I just didn't want Jacob to be the one to stop her, or rather 
to try. I didn't want Jacob within a hundred miles of her. 

"Like the stuff about the mind-reading bloodsucker," he continued, oblivious to my reverie. 
"That's the kind of thing we need to know about. That really sucks that those stories are true. 
It makes everything more complicated. Hey, do you think this Victoria can do anything 
special?" 

"I don't think so," I hesitated, and then sighed. "He would have mentioned it." 

"He? Oh, you mean Edward-oops, sorry. I forgot. You don't like to say his name. Or hear it." 

I squeezed my midsection, trying to ignore the throbbing around the edges of my chest. "Not 
really, no." 

"Sorry." 

"How do you know me so well, Jacob? Sometimes it's l ik e you can read my mind." 

"Naw. I just pay attention." 

We were on the little dirt road where Jacob had first taught me to ride the motorcycle. 

"This good?" I asked. 

"Sure, sure." 

I pulled over and cut the engine. 

"You're still pretty unhappy, aren't you?" he murmured. 

I nodded, staring unseeingly into the gloomy forest. 

"Did you ever think. . . that maybe. . . you're better off?" 

I inhaled slowly, and then let my breath out. "No." 

"'Cause he wasn't the best-" 

"Please, Jacob," I interrupted, begging in a whisper. "Could we please not talk about this? I 
can't stand it." 




"Okay." He took a deep breath. "I'm sorry I said anything." 

"Don't feel bad. If things were different, it would be nice to finally be able to talk to someone 
about it." 

He nodded. "Yeah, I had a hard time keeping a secret from you for two weeks. It must be 
hell to not be able to talk to anyone." 

"Hell," I agreed. 

Jacob sucked in a sharp breath. "They're here. Let's go." 

"Are you sure?" I asked while he popped his door open. "Maybe I shouldn't be here." 

"They'll deal with it," he said, and then he grinned. "Who's afraid of the big, bad wolf?" 

"Ha ha," I said. But I got out of the truck, hurrying around the front end to stand close beside 
Jacob. I remembered only too clearly the giant monsters in the meadow. My hands were 
trembling l ik e Jacob's had been before, but with fear rather than rage. 

Jake took my hand and squeezed it. "Here we go." 




14. FAMILY 



I COWERED INTO JACOB'S SIDE, MY EYES SCANNING the forest for the other 
werewolves. When they appeared, striding out from between the trees, they weren't what I 
was expecting. I'd gotten the image of the wolves stuck in my head. These were just four 
really big half-naked boys. 

Again, they reminded me of brothers, quadruplets. Something about the way they moved 
almost in synchronization to stand across the road from us, the way they all had the same 
long, round muscles under the same red-brown skin, the same cropped black hair, and the 
way their expressions altered at exactly the same moment. 

They started out curious and cautious. When they saw me there, half-hidden beside Jacob, 
they all became furious in the same second. 

Sam was still the biggest, though Jacob was getting close to catching up with him. Sam 
didn't really count as a boy. His face was older-not in the sense of lines or signs of aging, but 
in the matunry, the patience of his expression. 

"What have you done, Jacob?" he demanded. 

One of the others, one I didn't recognize-Jared or Paul-thrust past Sam and spoke before 
Jacob could defend himself. 

"Why can't you just follow the rules, Jacob?" he yelled, throwing his arms in the air. "What 
the hell are you thinking? Is she more important than everything-than the whole tribe? Than 
the people getting killed?" 

"She can help," Jacob said quietly. 

"Help!" the angry boy shouted. His arms begin to quiver. "Oh, that's likely! I'm sure the 
leech-lover is just dying to help us out!" 

"Don't talk about her l ik e that!" Jacob shouted back, stung by the boy's criticism. 

A shudder rippled through the other boy, along his shoulders and down his spine. 

"Paul! Relax!" Sam commanded. 

Paul shook his head back and forth, not in defiance, but as though he were trying to 
concentrate. 

"Jeez, Paul," one of the other boys-probably Jared-muttered. "Get a grip." 

Paul twisted his head toward Jared, his lips curling back in irritation. Then he shifted his 
glare in my direction. Jacob took a step to put himself in front of me. 




That did it. 



"Right, protect herl" Paul roared in outrage. Another shudder, a convulsion, heaved through 
his body. He threw his head back, a real growl tearing from between his teeth. 

"Paul!" Sam and Jacob shouted together. 

Paul seemed to fall forward, vibrating violently. Halfway to the ground, there was a loud 
ripping noise, and the boy exploded. 

Dark silver fur blew out from the boy, coalescing into a shape more than five-times his size-a 
massive, crouched shape, ready to spring. 

The wolfs muzzle wrinkled back over his teeth, and another growl rolled through his 
colossal chest. His dark, enraged eyes focused on me. 

In the same second, Jacob was running across the road straight for the monster. 

"Jacob!" I screamed. 

Mid-stride, a long tremor shivered down Jacob's spine. He leaped forward, diving headfirst 
into the empty air. 

With another sharp tearing sound, Jacob exploded, too. He burst out of his s ki n-shreds of 
black and white cloth blasted up into the air. It happened so quickly that if I'd blinked, I'd 
have missed the entire transformation. One second it was Jacob diving into the air, and then 
it was the gigantic, russet brown wolf-so enormous that I couldn't make sense of its mass 
somehow fitting inside Jacob-charging the crouched silver beast. 

Jacob met the other werewolf s attack head-on. Their angry snarls echoed like thunder off the 
trees. 

The black and white scraps-the remains of Jacob's clothes-fluttered to the ground where 
he'd disappeared. 

"Jacob!" I screamed again, staggering forward. 

"Stay where you are, Bella," Sam ordered. It was hard to hear him over the roar of the 
fighting wolves. They were snapping and tearing at each other, their sharp teeth flashing 
toward each other's throats. The Jacob-wolf seemed to have the upper hand-he was visibly 
bigger than the other wolf, and it looked like le was stronger, too. He rammed his shoulder 
against the gray wolf again and again, knocking him back toward the trees. 

"Take her to Emily's," Sam shouted toward the other boys, who were watching the conflict 
with rapt expressions. Jacob had successfully shoved the gray wolf off the road, and they 
were disappearing into the forest, though the sound of their snarls was still loud. Sam ran 
after them, kicking off his shoes on the way. As he darted into the trees, he was quivering 




from head to toe. 



The growling and snapping was fading into the distance. Suddenly, the sound cut off and it 
was very quiet on the road. 

One of the boys started laughing. 

I turned to stare at him-my wide eyes felt frozen, l ik e I couldn't even blink them. 

The boy seemed to be laughing at my expression. "Well, there's something you don't see 
every day," he snickered. His face was vaguely familiar-thinner than the others... Embry 
Call. 

"I do," the other boy, Jared, grumbled. "Every single day." 

"Aw, Paul doesn't lose his temper every day," Embry disagreed, still grinning. "Maybe two 
out of three." 

Jared stopped to pick something white up off the ground. He held it up toward Embry; it 
dangled in limp strips from his hand. 

"Totally shredded," Jared said. "Billy said this was the last pair he could afford-guess Jacob's 
going barefoot now." 

"This one survived," Embry said, holding up a white sneaker. "Jake can hop," he added with 
a laugh. 

Jared started collecting various pieces of fabric from the dirt. "Get Sam's shoes, will you? All 
the rest of this is headed for the trash." 

Embry grabbed the shoes and then jogged into the trees where Sam had disappeared. He was 
back in a few seconds with a pair of cut-off jeans draped over his arm. Jared gathered the 
torn remnants of Jacob's and Paul's clothes and wadded them into a ball. Suddenly, he 
seemed to remember me. 

He looked at me carefully, assessing. 

"Hey, you're not going to faint or puke or anything?" he demanded. 

"I don't think so," I gasped. 

"You don't look so good. Maybe you should sit down." 

"Okay," I mumbled. For the second time in one morning, I put my head between my knees. 
"Jake should have warned us," Embry complained. 

"He shouldn't have brought his girlfriend into this. What did he expect?" 




'Well, the wolfs out of the bag now." Embry sighed. "Way to go, Jake. 



I raised my head to glare at the two boys who seemed to be taking this all so lightly. "Aren't 
you worried about them at all?" I demanded. 

Embry blinked once in surprise "Worried? Why?" 

"They could hurt each other!" 

Embry and Jared guffawed. 

"I hope Paul gets a mouthful of him," Jared said. "Teach him a lesson." 

I blanched. 

"Yeah, right!" Embry disagreed. "Did you see Jake? Even Sam couldn't have phased on the 
fly l ik e that. He saw Paul losing it, and it took him, what, half a second to attack? The boy's 
got a gift." 

"Paul's been fighting longer. I'll bet you ten bucks he leaves a mark." 

"You're on. Jake's a natural. Paul doesn't have a prayer." 

They shook hands, grinning. 

I tried to comfort myself with their lack of concern, but I couldn't drive the brutal image of 
the fighting werewolves from my head. My stomach churned, sore and empty, my head ached 
with worry. 

"Let's go see Emily. You know she'll have food waiting." Embry looked down at me. "Mind 
giving us a ride?" 

"No problem," I choked. 

Jared raised one eyebrow. "Maybe you'd better drive, Embry. She still looks l ik e she might 
hurl." 

"Good idea. Where are the keys?" Embry asked me. 

"Ignition." 

Embry opened the passenger- side door. "In you go," he said cheerfully, hauling me up from 
the ground with one hand and stuffing me into my seat. He appraised the available space. 
"You'll have to ride in the back," he told Jared. 



'That's fine. I got a weak stomach. I don't want to be in there when she blows. 
'I bet she's tougher than that. She runs with vampires." 




'Five bucks?" Jared asked. 



"Done. I feel guilty, taking your money like this." 

Embry got in and started the engine while Jared leapt agilely into the bed. As soon as his 
door was closed, Embry muttered to me, "Don't throw up, okay? I've only got a ten, and if 
Paul got his teeth into Jacob. . ." 

"Okay," I whispered. 

Embry drove us back toward the village. 

"Hey, how did Jake get around the injunction anyway?" 

"The... what?" 

"Er, the order. You know, to not spill the beans. How did he 

"Oh, that," I said, remembering Jacob trying to choke out 
didn't. I guessed right." 

Embry pursed his lips, looking surprised. "Hmm. S'pose that would work." 

"Where are we going?" I asked. 

"Emily's house. She's Sam's girlfriend... no, fiancee, now, I guess. They'll meet us back there 
after Sam gives it to them for what just happened. And after Paul and Jake scrounge up some 
new clothes, if Paul even has any left." 

"Does Emily know about. . . ?" 

"Yeah. And hey, don't stare at her. That bugs Sam." 

I frowned at him. "Why would I stare?" 

Embry looked uncomfortable. "Like you saw just now, hanging out around werewolves has 
its risks." He changed the subject quickly. "Hey, are you okay about the whole thing with the 
black-haired bloodsucker in the meadow? It didn't look l ik e he was a friend of yours, but. ." 
Embry shrugged. 

"No, he wasn't my friend." 

"That's good. We didn't want to start anything, break the treaty, you know." 

"Oh, yeah, Jake told me about the treaty once, a long time ago. Why would killing Laurent 
break the treaty?" 

"Laurent," he repeated, snorting, like he was amused the vampire had had a name. "Well, we 



tell you about this?" 

the truth to me last night. "He 




were technically on Cullen turf. We're not allowed to attack any of them, the Cullens, at 
least, off our land-unless they break the treaty first. We didn't know if the black-haired one 
was a relative of theirs or something. Looked l ik e you knew him." 

"How would they go about breaking the treaty?" 

"If they bite a human. Jake wasn't so keen on the idea of letting it go that far." 

"Oh. Um, thanks. I'm glad you didn't wait." 

"Our pleasure." He sounded l ik e he meant that in a literal sense. 

Embry drove past the easternmost house on the highway before turning off onto a narrow 
dirt road. "Your truck is slow," he noted. 

"Sony." 

At the end of the lane was a tiny house that had once been gray. There was only one narrow 
window beside the weathered blue door, but the window box under it was filled with bright 
orange and yellow marigolds, giving the whole place a cheerful look. 

Embry opened the truck door and inhaled. "Mmm, Emily's cooking." 

Jared jumped out of the back of the truck and headed for the door, but Embry stopped him 
with one hand on his chest. He looked at me meaningfully, and cleared his throat. 

"I don't have my wallet on me," Jared said. 

"That's okay. I won't forget." 

They climbed up the one step and entered the house without knocking. I followed timidly 
after them. 

The front room, like Billy's house, was mostly kitchen. A young woman with satiny copper 
skin and long, straight, crow-black hair was standing at the counter by the sink, popping big 
muffins out of a tin and placing them on a paper plate. For one second, I thought the reason 
Embry had told me not to stare was because the girl was so beautiful. 

And then she asked "You guys hungry?" in a melodic voice, and she turned to face us full on, 
a smile on half of her face. 

The right side of her face was scarred from hairline to chin by three thick, red lines, livid in 
color though they were long healed. One line pulled down the comer of her dark, 
almond-shaped right eye, another twisted the right side of her mouth into a permanent 
grimace. 



Than kf ul for Embry's warning, I quickly turned my eyes to the muffins in her hands. They 
smelled wonderful-like fresh blueberries. 




"Oh," Emily said, surprised. "Who's this?" 

I looked up, trying to focus on the left half of her face. 

"Bella Swan," Jared told her, shrugging. Apparently, I'd been a topic of conversation before. 
"Who else?" 

"Leave it to Jacob to find a way around," Emily murmured. She stared at me, and neither half 
of her once-beautiful face was friendly. "So, you're the vampire girl." 

I stiffened. "Yes. Are you the wolf girl?" 

She laughed, as did Embry and Jared. The left half of her face warmed. "I guess I am." She 
turned to Jared. "Where's Sam?" 

"Bella, er, surprised Paul this morning." 

Emily rolled her good eye. "Ah, Paul," she sighed. "Do you think they'll be long? I was just 
about to start the eggs." 

"Don't worry," Embry told her. "If they're late, we won't let anything go to waste." 

Emily chuckled, and then opened the refrigerator. "No doubt," she agreed. "Bella, are you 
hungry? Go ahead and help yourself to a muffin." 

"Thanks." I took one from the plate and started nibbling around the edges. It was delicious, 
and it felt good in my tender stomach. Embry picked up his third and shoved it into his 
mouth whole. 

"Save some for your brothers," Emily chastised him, hitting him on the head with a wooden 
spoon. The word surprised me, but the others thought nothing of it. 

"Pig," Jared commented. 

I leaned against the counter and watched the three of them banter l ik e a family. Emily's 
kitchen was a friendly place, bright with white cupboards and pale wooden floorboards. On 
the little round table, a cracked blue-and-white china pitcher was overflowing with 
wildflowers. Embry and Jared seemed entirely at ease here. 

Emily was mixing a humongous batch of eggs, several dozen, in a big yellow bowl. She had 
the sleeves of her lavender shirt pushed up, and I could see that the scars extended all the 
way down her arm to the back of her right hand. Hanging out with werewolves truly did 
have its risks, just as Embry had said. 

The front door opened, and Sam stepped through. 

"Emily," he said, and so much love saturated his voice that I felt embarrassed, intrusive, as I 




watched him cross the room in one stride and take her face in his wide hands. He leaned 
down and kissed the dark scars on her right cheek before he kissed her lips. 

"Hey, none of that," Jared complained. "I'm eating." 

"Then shut up and eat," Sam suggested, kissing Emily's ruined mouth again. 

"Ugh," Embry groaned. 

This was worse than any romantic movie; this was so real that it sang out loud with joy and 
life and true love. I put my muffin down and folded my arms across my empty chest. I stared 
at the flowers, trying to ignore the utter peace of their moment, and the wretched throbbing 
of my wounds. 

I was grateful for the distraction when Jacob and Paul came through the door, and then 
shocked when I saw that they were laughing. While I watched, Paul punched Jacob on the 
shoulder and Jacob went for a kidney jab in return. They laughed again. They both appeared 
to be in one piece. 

Jacob scanned the room, his eyes stopping when he found me leaning, awkward and out of 
place, against the counter in the far comer of the kitchen. 

"Hey, Bells," he greeted me cheerfully. He grabbed two muffins as he passed the table and 
came to stand beside me. "Sorry about before," he muttered under his breath. "How are you 
holding up.'" 

"Don't worry, I'm okay. Good muffins." I picked mine back up and started nibbhrg again. My 
chest felt better as soon as Jacob was beside me. 

"Oh, man!" Jared wailed, interrupting us. 

I looked up, and he and Embry were examining a fading pink line on Paul's forearm. Embry 
was grinning, exultant. 

"Fifteen dollars," he crowed. 

"Did you do that?" I whispered to Jacob, remembering the bet. 

"I barely touched him. He'll be perfect by sundown." 

"By sundown?" I looked at the line on Paul's arm. Odd, but it looked weeks old. 

"Wolf thing," Jacob whispered. 

I nodded, trying to not look weirded out. 

" You okay?" I asked him under my breath. 




Not a scratch on me." His expression was smug. 



"Hey, guys," Sam said in a loud voice, interrupting all the conversations going on in the small 
room. Emily was at the stove, scraping the egg mixture around a big skillet, but Sam still had 
one hand touching the small of her back, an unconscious gesture. "Jacob has information for 
us." 



Paul looked unsurprised. Jacob must have explained this to him and Sam already. Or... 
they'd just heard his thoughts. 

"I know what the redhead wants." Jacob directed his words toward Jared and Embry. "That's 
what I was trying to tell you before." He kicked the leg of the chair Paul had settled into. 

"And?" Jared asked. 

Jacob's face got serious. "She is trying to avenge her mate-only it wasn't the black-haired 
leech we killed. The Cullens got her mate last year, and she's after Bella now." 

This wasn't news to me, but I still shivered. 

Jared, Embry, and Emily stared at me with open-mouthed surprise. 

"She's just a girl," Embry protested. 

"I didn't say it made sense. But that's why the bloodsucker's been trying to get past us. She's 
been heading for Forks." 

They continued to stare at me, mouths still hanging open, for a long moment. I ducked my 
head. 

"Excellent," Jared finally said, a smile beginning to pull up the comers of his mouth. "We've 
got bait." 

With stunning speed, Jacob yanked a can opener from the counter and launched it at Jared's 
head. Jared's hand flicked up faster than I would have thought possible, and he snagged the 
tool just before it hit his face. 

"Bella is not bait." 

"You know what I mean," Jared said, unabashed. 

"So we'll be changing oar patterns," Sam said, ignoring their squabble. "We'll try leaving a 
few holes, and see if she falls for it. We'll have to split up, and I don't like that. But if she's 
really after Bella, she probably won't try to take advantage of our divided numbers." 

"Quit's got to be close to joining us," Embry murmured. "Then we'll be able to split evenly." 

Everyone looked down. I glanced at Jacob's face, and it was hopeless, like it had been 




yesterday afternoon, outside his house. No matter how comfortable they seemed to be with 
their fate, here in this happy kitchen, none of these werewolves wanted the same fate for 
their friend. 

"Well, we won't count on that," Sam said in a low voice, and then continued at his regular 
volume. "Paul, Jared, and Embry will take the outer perimeter, and Jacob and I will take the 
inner. We'll collapse in when we've got her trapped." 

I noticed that Emily didn't particularly like that Sam would be in the smaller grouping. Her 
worry had me glancing up at Jacob, worrying, too. 

Sam caught my eye. "Jacob thinks it would be best if you spent as much time as possible here 
in La Push. She won't know where to find you so easily, just in case." 

"What about Charlie?" I demanded. 

"March Madness is still going," Jacob said. "I think Billy and Harry can manage to keep 
Charlie down here when he's not at work." 

"Wait," Sam said, holding one hand up. His glance flickered to Emily and then back to me. 
"That's what Jacob thinks is best, but you need to decide for yourself. You should weigh the 
risks of both options very seriously. You saw this morning how easily things can get 
dangerous here, how quickly they get out of hand. If you choose to stay with us, I can't make 
any guarantees about your safety." 

"I won't hurt her," Jacob mumbled, looking down. 

Sam acted as if he hadn't heard h im speak. "If there was somewhere else you felt safe..." 

I bit my lip. Where could I go that wouldn't put someone else in danger? I recoiled again 
from the idea of bringing Renee into this-pulling her into the circle of the target I wore. . . "I 
don't want to lead Victoria anywhere else," I whispered. 

Sam nodded. "That's true. It's better to have her here, where we can end this." 

I flinched. I didn't want Jacob or any of the rest of them trying to end Victoria. I glanced at 
Jake's face; it was relaxed, almost the same as I remembered it from before the onset of the 
wolf thing, and utterly unconcerned by the idea of hunting vampires. 

"You'll be careful, right?" I asked, an audible lump in my throat. 

The boys burst into loud hoots of amusement. Everyone laughed at me-except Emily. She 
met my eyes, and I could suddenly see the symmetry underlying her deformity. Her face was 
still beautiful, and alive with a concern even more fierce than mine. I had to look away, 
before the love behind that concern could start me aching again. 



Eood's ready," she announced then, and the strategic conversation was history. The guys 




hurried to surround the table-which looked tiny and in danger of being crushed by them-and 
devoured the buffet-sized pan of eggs Emily placed in their midst in record time. Emily ate 
leaning against the counter l ik e me-avoiding the bedlam at the table-and watched them with 
affectionate eyes. Her expression clearly stated that this was her family. 

All in all, it wasn't exactly what I'd been expecting from a pack of werewolves. 

I spent the day in La Push, the majority of it in Billy's house. He left a message on Charlie's 
phone and at the station, and Charlie showed up around dinnertime with two pizzas. It was 
good he brought two larges; Jacob ate one all by himself. 

I saw Charlie eyeing the two of us suspiciously all night, especially the much-changed Jacob. 
He asked about the hair; Jacob shrugged and told him it was just more convenient. 

I knew that as soon as Charlie and I were headed home, Jacob would take off-off to run 
around as a wolf, as he had done intermittently through the entire day. He and his brothers of 
sorts kept up a constant watch, looking for some sign of Victoria's return. But since they'd 
chased her away from the hot springs last night-chased her halfway to Canada, according to 
Jacob-she'd yet to make another foray. 

I had no hope at all that she might just give up. I didn't have that kind of luck. 

Jacob walked me to my truck after dinner and lingered by the window, waiting for Charlie to 
drive away first. 

"Don't be afraid tonight," Jacob said, while Charlie pretended to be having trouble with his 
seat belt. "We'll be out there, watching." 

"I won't worry about myself," I promised. 

"You're silly. Hunting vampires is fun. It's the best part of this whole mess." 

I shook my head. "If I'm silly, then you're dangerously unbalanced." 

He chuckled. "Get some rest, Bella, honey. You look exhausted." 

"I'll try." 

Charlie honked his horn impatiently. 

"See you tomorrow," Jacob said. "Come down first thing." 

"I will." 

Charlie followed me home. I paid scant attention to the lights in my rearview mirror. Instead, 
I wondered where Sam and Jared and Embry and Paul were, out running in the night. I 
wondered if Jacob had joined them yet. 




When we got home, I hurried for the stairs, but Charlie was right behind me. 



"What's going on, Bella?" he demanded before I could escape. "I thought Jacob was part of a 
gang and you two were fighting." 

"We made up." 

"And the gang?" 

"I don't know-who can understand teenage boys? They're a mystery. But I met Sam Uley 
and his fiancee, Emily. The seemed pretty nice to me." I shrugged. "Must have all been a 
mi sunder standing . " 

His face changed. "I hadn't heard that he and Emily had made it official. That's nice. Poor 
girl." 

"Do you know what happened to her?" 

"Mauled by a bear, up north, during salmon spawning season-horrible accident It was more 
than a year ago now. I heard Sam was really messed up over it." 

"That's horrible," I echoed. More than a year ago. I'd bet that meant it had happened when 
there was just one werewolf in La Push. I shuddered at the thought of how Sam must have 
felt every time he looked at Emily's face. 

That night, I lay awake for a long time trying to sort through the day. I worked my way 
backward through dinner with Billy, Jacob, and C harlie, to the long afternoon in the Blacks' 
house, waiting anxiously to hear something from Jacob, to Emily's kitchen, to the horror of 
the werewolf fight, to talking with Jacob on the beach. 

I thought about what Jacob had said early this morning, about hypocrisy. I thought about 
that for a long time. I didn't like to think that I was a hypocrite, only what was the point of 
lying to myself? 

I curled into a tight ball. No, Edward wasn't a killer. Even in his darker past, he'd never been 
a murderer of innocents, at least. 

But what if he had been? What if, during the time I that I'd known him, he'd been just l ik e 
any other vampire? What if people had been disappearing from the woods, just l ik e now? 
Would that have kept me away from him? 

I shook my head sadly. Love is irrational, I reminded myself. The more you loved someone, 
the less sense anything made. 

I rolled over and tried to think of something else-and I thought of Jacob and his brothers, out 
running in the darkness. I fell asleep imagining the wolves, invisible in the night, guarding 
me from danger. When I dreamed, I stood in the forest again, but I didn't wander. I was 




holding Emily's scarred hand as we faced into the shadows and waited anxiously for our 
werewolves to come home. 




15 PRESSURE 



IT WAS SPRING BREAK IN FORKS AGAIN. WHEN I WOKE UP on Monday morning, 
I lay in bed for a few seconds absorbing that. Last spring break, I'd been hunted by a 
vampire, too. I hoped this wasn't some kind of tradition forming. 

Already I was falling into the pattern of things in La Push. I'd spent Sunday mostly on the 
beach, while Charlie hung out with Billy at the Blacks' house. I was supposed to be with 
Jacob, but Jacob had other things to do, so I wandered alone, keeping the secret from 
Charlie. 

When Jacob dropped in to check on me, he apologized for ditching me so much. He told me 
his schedule wasn't always this crazy, but until Victoria was stopped, the wolves were on red 
alert. 

When we walked along the beach now, he always held my hand. 

This made me brood over what Jared had said, about Jacob involving his "girlfriend." I 
supposed that that was exactly what it looked like from the outside. As long as Jake and I 
knew how it really was, I shouldn't let those kinds of assumptions bother me. And maybe 
they wouldn't, if I hadn't known that Jacob would have loved for things to be what they 
appeared. But his hand felt nice as it warmed mine, and I didn't protest. 

I worked Tuesday afternoon-Jacob followed me on his bike to make sure I arrived safely-and 
Mike noticed. 

"Are you dating that kid from La Push? The sophomore?" He asked, poorly disguising the 
resentment in his tone. 

I shrugged. "Not in the technical sense of the word. I do spent most of my time with Jacob, 
though. He's my best friend." 

Mike's eyes narrowed shrewdly. "Don't kid yourself, Bella. The guy's head over heels for 
you." 

"I know," I sighed. "Life is complicated." 

"And girls are cruel," Mike said under his breath. 

I supposed that was an easy assumption to make, too. 

That night, Sam and Emily joined Charlie and me for dessert at Billy's house. Emily brought 
a cake that would have won over a harder man than Charlie. I could see, as the conversation 
flowed naturally through a range of casual subjects, that any worries Charlie might have 
harbored about gangs in La Push were being dissolved. 

Jake and I skipped out early, to get some privacy. We went out to his garage and sat in the 




Rabbit. Jacob leaned his head back, his face drawn with exhaustion. 



"You need some sleep, Jake." 

'Tll get around to it." 

He reached over and took my hand. His skin was blazing on mine. 

"Is that one of those wolf things?" I asked him. "The heat, I mean." 

"Yeah. We run a little warmer than the normal people. About one-oh-eight, one-oh-nine. I 
never get cold anymore. I could stand l ik e this"-he gestured to his bare torso-"in a 
snowstorm and it wouldn't bother me. The flakes would turn to rain where I stood." 

"And you all heal fast-that's a wolf thing, too?" 

"Yeah, wanna see? It's pretty cool." His eyes flipped open and he grinned. He reached around 
me to the glove compartment and dug around for a minute. His hand came out with a 
pocketknife. 

"No, I do not want to see!" I shouted as soon as I realized what he was thinking. "Put that 
away!" 

Jacob chuckled, but shoved the knife back where it belonged. "Fine. It's a good thing we 
heal, though. You can't go see just any doctor when you're running a temperature that should 
mean you're dead." 

"No, I guess not." I thought about that for a minute. ". . . And being so big-that's part of it? Is 
that why you're all worried about Quil?" 

"That and the fact that Quil's grandfather says the kid could fry an egg on his forehead." 
Jacob's face turned hopeless. "It won't be long now. There's no exact age... it just builds and 
builds and then suddenly-" He broke off, and it was a moment before he could speak again. 
"Sometimes, if you get really upset or something, that can trigger it early. But I wasn't upset 
about anything-I was happy." He laughed bitterly. "Because of you, mostly. That's why it 
didn't happen to me sooner. Instead it just kept on building up inside me-I was l ik e a time 
bomb. You know what set me off? I got back from that movie and Billy said I looked weird. 
That was all, but I just snapped. And then I-I exploded. I almost ripped his face off-my own 
father!" He shuddered, and his face paled. 

"Is it really bad, Jake?" I asked anxiously, wishing I had some way to help him. "Are you 
miserable?" 

"No, I'm not miserable," he told me. "Not anymore. Not now that you know. That was hard, 
before." He leaned over so that his cheek was resting on top of my head. 

He was quiet for a moment, and I wondered what he was thinking about. Maybe I didn't 




want to know. 



"What's the hardest part?" I whispered, still wishing I could help. 

"The hardest part is feeling... out of control," he said slowly. "Feeling l ik e I can't be sure of 
myself-like maybe you shouldn't be around me, l ik e maybe nobody should. Like I'm a 
monster who might hurt somebody. You've seen Emily. Sam lost control of his temper for 
just one second. . . and she was standing too close. And now there's nothing he can ever do to 
put it right again. I hear his thoughts-I know what that feels like. . . 

"Who wants to be a nightmare, a monster? 

"And then, the way it comes so easily to me, the way I'm better at it than the rest of 
them-does that make me even less human than Enbry or Sam? Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm 
losing myself." 

"Is it hard? To find yourself again?" 

"At first," he said. "It takes some practice to phase back and forth. But it's easier tor me." 
"Why?" I wondered. 

"Because Ephraim Black was my father's grandfather, and Quil Ateara was my mother's 
grandfather." 

"Quil?" I asked in confusion. 

"His great-grandfather," Jacob clarified. "The Quil you know is my second cousin." 

"But why does it matter who your great-grandfathers are?" 

"Because Ephraim and Quil were in the last pack. Levi Uley was the third. It's in my blood 
on both sides. I never had a chance. Like Quil doesn't have a chance." 

His expression was bleak. 

"What's the very best part?" I asked, hoping to cheer him up. 

"The best part," he said, suddenly smiling again, "is the speed.” 

"Better than the motorcycles?" 

He nodded, enthusiastic. "There's no comparison." 

"How fast can you. . . ?" 

"Run?" he finished my question. "Fast enough. What can I measure it by? We caught. . . what 
was his name? Laurent? I imagine that means more to you than it would to someone else." 




It did mean something to me. I couldn't imagine that-the wolves running faster than a 
vampire. When the Cullens ran, they all but turned invisible with speed. 

"So, tell me something I don't know," he said. "Something about vampires. How did you 
stand it, being around them? Didn't it creep you out?" 

"No," I said curtly. 

My tone made him thoughtful for a moment. 

"Say, why'd your bloodsucker kill that James, anyway?" he asked suddenly. 

"James was trying to kill me-it was l ik e a game for him. He lost. Do you remember last 
spring when I was in the hospital down in Phoenix?" 

Jacob sucked in a breath. "He got that close?" 

"He got very, very close." I stroked my scar. Jacob noticed, because he held the hand I 
moved. 

"What's that?" He traded hands, examining my right. "This is your funny scar, the cold one." 
He looked at it closer, with new eyes, and gasped. 

"Yes, it's what you think it is," I said. "James bit me." 

His eyes bulged, and his face turned a strange, sallow color under the russet surface. He 
looked like he was about to be sick. 

"But if he bit you... ? Shouldn't you be... ?" He choked. 

"Edward saved me twice," I whispered. "He sucked the venom out-you know, l ik e with a 
rattlesnake." I twitched as the pain lashed around the edges of the hole. 

But I wasn't the only one twitching. I could feel Jacob's whole body trembling next to mine. 
Even the car shook. 

"Careful, Jake. Easy. Ca in down." 

"Yeah," he panted. "Calm." He shook his head back and forth quickly. After a moment, only 
his hands were shaking. 

"You okay?" 

"Yeah, almost. Tell me something else. Give me something else to think about." 

"What do you want to know?" 

"I don't know." He had his eyes closed, concentrating. "The extra stuff I guess. Did any of 




the other Cullens have. . . extra talents? Like the mind reading?" 

I hesitated a second. This felt l ik e a question he would ask of his spy, not his friend. But 
what was the point of hiding what I knew? It didn't matter now, and it would help h im 
control himself. 

So I spoke quickly, the image of Emily's ruined face in my mind, and the hair rising on my 
arms. I couldn't imagine how the russet wolf would fit inside the Rabbit-Jacob would tear 
the whole garage apart if he changed now. 

"Jasper could. . . sort of control the emotions of the people around him. Not in a bad way, just 
to calm someone down, that kind of thing. It would probably help Paul a lot," I added, 
teasing weakly. "And then Alice could see things that were going to happen. The future, you 
know, but not absolutely. The things she saw would change when someone changed the 
path they were on. . . " 

Like how she'd seen me dying... and she'd seen me becoming one of them. Two things that 
had not happened. And one that never would. My head started to spin-I couldn't seem to 
pull in enough oxygen from the air. No lungs. 

Jacob was entirely in control now, very still beside me. 

"Why do you do that?" he asked. He tugged lightly at one of my arms, which was bound 
around my chest, and then gave up when it wouldn't come loose easily. I hadn't even realized 
I'd moved them. "You do that when you're upset. Why?" 

"It hurts to think about them," I whispered. "It's l ik e I can't breathe... l ik e I'm breaking into 
pieces. . ."It was bizarre how much I could tell Jacob now. We had no more secrets. 

He smoothed my hair. "It's okay, Bella, it's okay. I won't bring it up again. I'm sorry." 

"I'm fine." I gasped. "Happens all the time. Not your fault." 

"We're a pretty messed-up pair, aren't we?" Jacob said. "Neither one of us can hold our shape 
together right." 

"Pathetic," I agreed, still breathless. 

"At least we have each other," he said, clearly comforted by the thought. 

I was comforted, too. "At least there's that," I agreed. 

And when we were together, it was fine. But Jacob had a horrible, dangerous job he felt 
compelled to do, and so I was often alone, stuck in La Push for safety, with nothing to do to 
keep my mind off any of my worries. 



I felt awkward, always taking up space at Billy's. I did some studying for another Calculus 




test that was coming up next week, but I could only look at math for so long. When I didn't 
have something obvious to do in my hands, 



I felt l ik e I ought to be making conversation with Billy-the pressure of normal societal rules. 
But Billy wasn't one for filling up the long silences, and so the awkwardness continued. 

I tried hanging out at Emily's place Wednesday afternoon, for a change. At first it was kind 
of nice. Emily was a cheerful person who never sat still. I drifted behind her while she flitted 
around her little house and yard, scrubbing at the spotless floor, pulling a tiny weed, fixing a 
broken hinge, tugging a string of wool through an ancient loom, and always cooking, too. 
She complained lightly about the increase in the boys' appetites from all their extra running, 
but it was easy to see she didn't mind taking care of them. It wasn't hard to be with her-after 
all, we were both wolf girls now. 

But Sam checked in after I'd been there for a few hours. I only stayed long enough to 
ascertain that Jacob was fine and there was no news, and then I had to escape. The aura of 
love and contentment that surrounded them was harder to take in concentrated doses, with 
no one else around to dilute it. 

So that left me wandering the beach, pacing the length of the rocky crescent back and forth, 
again and again. 

Alone time wasn't good for me. Thanks to the new honesty with Jacob, I'd been talking and 
thinking about the Cullens way too much. No matter how I tried to distract myself-and I had 
plenty to think of: I was honestly and desperately worried about Jacob and his wolf-brothers, 
I was terrified for Charlie and the others who thought they were hunting animals, I was 
getting in deeper and deeper with Jacob without ever having consciously decided to progress 
in that direction and I didn't know what to do about it-none of these very real, very 
deserving of thought, very pressing concerns could take my mind off the pain in my chest for 
long. Eventually, I couldn't even walk anymore, because I couldn't breathe. I sat down on a 
patch of semidry rocks and curled up in a ball. 

Jacob found me like that, and I could tell from his expression that he understood. 

"Sorry," he said right away. He pulled me up from the ground and wrapped both arms around 
my shoulders. I hadn't realized that I was cold until then. His warmth made me shudder, but 
at least I could breathe with him there. 

"I'm ruining your spring break," Jacob accused himself as we walked back up the beach. 

"No, you're not. I didn't have any plans. I don't think I l ik e spring breaks, anyway." 

"I'll take tomorrow morning off. The others can run without me. We'll do something fun." 

The word seemed out of place in my life right now, barely comprehensible, bizarre. "Fun?" 
"Fun is exactly what you need. Hmm..." he gazed out across the heaving gray waves, 




deliberating. As his eyes scanned the horizon, he had a flash of inspiration. 

"Got it!" he crowed. "Another promise to keep." 

"What are you talking about?" 

He let go of my hand and pointed toward the southern edge of the beach, where the flat, 
rocky half-moon dead-ended against the sheer sea cliffs. I stared, uncomprehending. 

"Didn't I promise to take you cliff diving?" 

I shivered. 

"Yeah, it'll be pretty cold-not as cold as it is today. Can you feel the weather changing? The 
pressure? It will be warmer tomorrow. You up for it?" 

The dark water did not look inviting, and, from this angle, the cliffs looked even higher than 
before. 

But it had been days since I'd heard Edward's voice. That was probably part of the problem. I 
was addicted to the sound of my delusions. It made things worse if I went too long without 
them. Jumping off a cliff was certain to remedy that situation. 

"Sure, I'm up for it. Fun." 

"It's a date," he said, and draped his arm around my shoulders. 

"Okay-now let's go get you some sleep." I didn't l ik e the way the circles under his eyes were 
beginning to look permanently etched onto his s ki n. 



I woke early the next morning and snuck a change of clothes out to the truck. I had a feeling 
that Charlie would approve of today's plan just about as much as he would approve of the 
motorcycle. 

The idea of a distraction from all my worries had me almost excited. Maybe it would be fun. 
A date with Jacob, a date with Edward. . . I laughed darkly to myself. Jake could say what he 
wanted about us being a messed-up pair-I was the one who was truly messed up. I made the 
werewolf seem downright normal. 

I expected Jacob to meet me out front, the way he usually did when my noisy truck 
announced my arrival. When he didn't, I guessed that he might still be sleeping. I would 
wait-let him get as much rest as he could. He needed his sleep, and that would give the day 
time to warm a bit more. Jake had been right about the weather, though; it had changed in 
the night. A thick layer of clouds pressed heavily on the atmosphere now, making it almost 
sultry; it was warm and close under the gray blanket. I left my sweater in the truck. 




I knocked quietly on the door. 

"C'mon in, Bella," Billy said. 

He was at the kitchen table, eating cold cereal. 

"Jake sleeping?" 

"Er, no." He set his spoon down, and his eyebrows pulled together. 

"What happened?" I demanded. I could tell from his expression that something had. 

"Embry, Jared, and Paul crossed a fresh trail early this morning. Sam and Jake took off to 
help. Sam was hopeful-she's hedged herself in beside the mountains. He thinks they have a 
good chance to finish this." 

"Oh, no, Billy," I whispered. "Oh, no." 

He chuckled, deep and low. "Do you really l ik e La Push so well that you want to extend your 
sentence here?" 

"Don't make jokes, Billy. This is too scary for that." 

"You're right," he agreed, still complacent. His ancient eyes were impossible to read. "This 
one's tricky." 

I bit my lip. 

"It's not as dangerous for them as you think it is. Sam knows what he's doing. You're the one 
that you should worry about. The vampire doesn't want to fight them. She's just trying to 
find a way around them. . . to you." 

"How does Sam know what he's doing?" I demanded, bmshing aside his concern for me. 
"They've only killed just the one vampire-that could have been luck." 

"We take what we do very seriously, Bella. Nothing's been forgotten. Everything they need 
to know has been passed down from father to son for generations." 

That didn't comfort me the way he probably intended it to. The memory of Victoria, wild, 
catlike, lethal, was too strong in my head. If she couldn't get around the wolves, she would 
eventually try to go through them. 

Billy went back to his breakfast; I sat down on the sofa and flipped aimlessly though the TV 
channels. That didn't last long. I started to feel closed in by the small room, claustrophobic, 
upset by the fact that I couldn't see out the curtained windows. 

"I'll be at the beach," I told Billy abruptly, and hurried out the door. 




Being outside didn't help as much as I'd hoped. The clouds pushed down with an invisible 
weight that kept the claustrophobia from easing. The forest seemed strangely vacant as I 
walked toward the beach. I didn't see any animals-no birds, no squirrels. I couldn't hear any 
birds, either. The silence was eerie; there wasn't even the sound of wind in the trees. 

I knew it was all just a product of the weather, but it still made me edgy. The heavy, warm 
pressure of the atmosphere was perceptible even to my weak human senses, and it hinted at 
something major in the storm department. A glance at the sky backed this up; the clouds 
were churning sluggishly despite the lack of breeze on the ground. The closest clouds were a 
smoky gray, but between the cracks I could see another layer that was a gruesome purple 
color. The skies had a ferocious plan in store for today. The animals must be bunkering 
down. 

As soon as I reached the beach, I wished I hadn't come-I'd already had enough of this place. 
I'd been here almost every day, wandering alone. Was it so much different from my 
nightmares? But where else to go? I trudged down to the driftwood tree, and sat at the end 
so that I could lean against the tangled roots. I stared up at the angry sky broodingly, waiting 
for the first drops to break the stillness. 

I tried not to think about the danger Jacob and his friends were in. Because nothing could 
happen to Jacob. The thought was unendurable. I'd lost too much already-would fate take 
the last few shreds of peace left behind? That seemed unfair, out of balance. But maybe I'd 
violated some unknown rule, crossed some line that had condemned me. Maybe it was 
wrong to be so involved with myths and legends, to turn my back on the human world. 
Maybe... 

No. Nothing would happen to Jacob. I had to believe that or I wouldn't be able to function. 

"Argh!" I groaned, and jumped off the log. I couldn't sit still; it was worse than pacing. 

I'd really been counting on hearing Edward this morning. It seemed l ik e that was the one 
thing that might make it bearable to live through this day. The hole had been festering lately, 
l ik e it was getting revenge for the times that Jacob's presence had tamed it. The edges 
burned. 

The waves picked up as I paced, beginning to crash against the rocks, but there was still no 
wind. I felt pinned down by the pressure of the storm. Everything swirled around me, but it 
was perfectly still where I stood. The air had a faint electric charge-I could feel the static in 
my hair. 

Farther out, the waves were angrier than they were along the shore. I could see them 
battering against the line of the cliffs, spraying big white clouds of sea foam into the sky. 
There was still no movement in the air, though the clouds roiled more quickly now. It was 
eerie looking-like the clouds were moving by their own will. I shivered, though I knew it 
was just a trick of the pressure. 




The cliffs were a black knife edge against the livid sky. Staring at them, I remembered the 
day Jacob had told me about Sam and his "gang." I thought of the boys-the 
werewolves-throwing themselves into the empty air. The image of the falling, spiraling 
figures was still vivid in my mind. I imagined the utter freedom of the fall... I imagined the 
way Edward's voice would have sounded in my head-furious, velvet, perfect... The burning 
in my chest flared agonizingly. 

There had to be some way to quench it. The pain was growing more and more intolerable by 
the second. I glared at the cliffs and the crashing waves. 

Well, why not? Why not quench it right now? 

Jacob had promised me cliff diving, hadn't he? Just because he was unavailable, should I 
have to give up the distraction I needed so badly-needed even worse because Jacob was out 
risking his life? Risking it, in essence, for me. If it weren't for me, Victoria would not be 
killing people here... just somewhere else, far away. If anything happened to Jacob, it would 
be my fault. That realization stabbed deep and had me jogging back up to the road toward 
Billy's house, where my truck waited. 

I knew my way to the lane that passed closest to the cliffs, but I had to hunt for the little path 
that would take me out to the ledge. As I followed it, I looked for turns or forks, knowing 
that Jake had planned to take me off the lower outcropping rather than the top, but the path 
wound in a thin single line toward the brink with no options. I didn't have time to find 
another way down-the storm was moving in quickly now. The wind was finally beginning to 
touch me, the clouds pressing closer to the ground. Just as I reached the place where the dirt 
path fanned out into the stone precipice, the first drops broke through and splattered on my 
face. 

It was not hard to convince myself that I didn't have time to search for another way-I wanted 
to jump from the top. This was the image that had lingered in my head. I wanted the long fall 
that would feel like flying. 

I knew that this was the stupidest, most reckless thing I had done yet. The thought made me 
smile. The pain was already easing, as if my body knew that Edward's voice was just seconds 
away... 

The ocean sounded very far away, somehow farther than before, when I was on the path in 
the trees. I grimaced when I thought of the probable temperature of the water. But I wasn't 
going to let that stop me. 

The wind blew stronger now, whipping the rain into eddies around me. 

I stepped out to the edge, keeping my eyes on the empty space in front of me. My toes felt 
ahead blindly, caressing the edge of the rock when they encountered it. I drew in a deep 
breath and held it . . waiting. 




Bella. 



I smiled and exhaled. 

Yes'! I didn't answer out loud, for fear that the sound of my voice would shatter the beautiful 
illusion. He sounded so real, so close. It was only when lie was disapproving l ik e this that I 
could hear the true memory of his voice-the velvet texture and the musical intonation that 
made up the most perfect of all voices. 

"Don't do this," he pleaded. 

You wanted me to be human, I reminded him. Well, watch me. 

"Please. For me." 

But you won 7 stay with me any other way. 

"Please." It was just a whisper in the blowing rain that tossed my hair and drenched my 
clothe s-making me as wet as if this were my second jump of the day. 

I rolled up onto the balls of my feet. 

"No, Bella!" He was angry now, and the anger was so lovely. 

I smiled and raised my arms straight out, as if I were going to dive, lifting my face into the 
rain. But it was too ingrained from years of swimming at the public pool-feet first, first time. 
I leaned forward, crouching to get more spring. . . 

And I flung myself off the cliff. 

I screamed as I dropped through the open air l ik e a meteor, but it was a scream of 
exhilaration and not fear. The wind resisted, trying vainly to fight the unconquerable gravity, 
pushing against me and twirling me in spirals l ik e a rocket crashing to the earth. 

Yes\ The word echoed through my head as I sliced through the surface of the water. It was 
icy, colder than I'd feared, and yet the chill only added to the high. 

I was proud of myself as I plunged deeper into the freezing black water. I hadn't had one 
moment of terror-just pure adrenaline. Really, the fall wasn't scary at all. Where was the 
challenge? 

That was when the current caught me. 

I'd been so preoccupied by the size of the cliffs, by the obvious danger of their high, sheer 
faces, that I hadn't worried at all about the dark water waiting. I never dreamed that the true 
menace was lurking far below me, under the heaving surf. 

It felt l ik e the waves were fighting over me, jerking me back and forth between them as if 




determined to share by pulling me into halves. I knew the right way to avoid a riptide: swim 
parallel to the beach rather than struggling for the shore. But the knowledge did me little 
good when I didn't know which way the shore was. 

I couldn't even tell which way the surface was. 

The angry water was black in every direction; there was no brightness to direct me upward. 
Gravity was all-powerful when it competed with the air, but it had nothing on the waves-I 
couldn't feel a downward pull, a sinking in any direction. Just the battering of the current 
that flung me round and round l ik e a rag doll. 

I fought to keep my breath in, to keep my lips locked around my last store of oxygen. 

It didn't surprise me that my delusion of Edward was there. He owed me that much, 
considering that I was dying. I was surprised by how sure that knowledge was. I was going 
to drown. I was drowning. 

"Keep swimming!" Edward begged urgently in my head. 

Where ? There was nothing but the darkness. There was no place to swim to. 

"Stop that!" he ordered. "Don't you dare give up!" 

The cold of the water was numbing my arms and legs. I didn't feel the buffeting so much as 
before. It was more of just a dizziness now, a helpless spinning in the water. 

But I listened to him. I forced my arms to continue reaching, my legs to kick harder, though 
every second I was facing a new direction. It couldn't be doing any good. What was the 
point? 

"Fight!" he yelled. "Damn it, Bella, keep fighting." 

Why? 

I didn't want to fight anymore. And it wasn't the light-headedness, or the cold, or the failure 
of my arms as the muscles gave out in exhaustion, that made me content to stay where I was. 
I was almost happy that it was over. This was an easier death than others I'd faced. Oddly 
peaceful. 

I thought briefly of the cliches, about how you were suppose to see your life flash before your 
eyes. I was so much luckier. Who wanted to see a rerun, anyway? 

I saw him, and I had no will to fight. It was so clear, so much more defined than any memory. 
My subconscious had stored Edward away in flawless detail, saving him for this final 
moment. I could see his perfect face as if he were really there; the exact shade of his icy skin, 
the shape of his lips, the line of his jaw, the gold glinting in his furious eyes. He was angry, 
naturally, that I was giving up. His teeth were clenched and his nostrils flared with rage. 




No! Bella, no! 



My ears were flooded with the freezing water, but his voice was clearer than ever. I ignored 
his words and concentrated on the sound of his voice. Why would I fight when I was so 
happy where I was? Even as my lungs burned for more air and my legs cramped in the icy 
cold, I was content. I'd forgotten what real happiness felt like. 

Happiness. It made the whole dying thing pretty bearable. 

The current won at that moment, shoving me abruptly against something hard, a rock 
invisible in the gloom. It hit me solidly across the chest, slamming into me like an iron bar, 
and the breath whooshed out of my lungs, escaping in a thick cloud of silver bubbles. Water 
flooded down my throat, choking and burning. The iron bar seemed to be dragging me, 
pulling me away from Edward, deeper into the dark, to the ocean floor. 

Goodbye, I love you , was my last thought. 




16. PARIS 



AT THAT MOMENT, MY HEAD BROKE THE SURFACE. 

How disorienting. I'd been sure I was sinking. 

The current wouldn't let up. It was slamming me against more rocks; they beat against the 
center of my back sharply, rhythmically, pushing the water from my lungs. It gushed out in 
amazing volume, absolute torrents pouring from my mouth and nose. The salt burned and my 
lungs burned and my throat was too full of water to catch a breath and the rocks were 
hurting my back. Somehow I stayed in one place, though the waves still heaved around me. I 
couldn't see anything but water everywhere, reaching for my face. 

"Breathe!" a voice, wild with anxiety, ordered, and I felt a cruel stab of pain wher I 
recognized the voice-because it wasn't Edward's. 

I could not obey. The waterfall pouring from my mouth didn't stop long enough for me to 
catch a breath. The black, icy water filled my chest, burning. 

The rock smacked into my back again, right between my shoulder blades, and another volley 
of water choked its way out of my lungs. 

"Breathe, Bella! C'mon!" Jacob begged. 

Black spots bloomed across my vision, getting wider and wider, blocking out the light. 

The rock struck me again. 

The rock wasn't cold l ik e the water; it was hot on my s ki n. I realized it was Jacob's hand, 
trying to beat the water from my lungs. The iron bar that had dragged me from the sea was 
also. . . warm. . . My head whirled, the black spots covered everything. . . 

Was I dying again, then? I didn't l ik e it-this wasn't as good as the last time. It was only dark 
now, nothing worth looking at here. The sound of the crashing waves faded into the black 
and became a quiet, even whoosh that sounded like it was coming from the inside of my 
ears... 

"Bella?" Jacob asked, his voice still tense, but not as wild as before. "Bells, honey, can you 
hear me?" 

The contents of my head swished and rolled sickeningly, l ik e they'd joined the rough water. . . 
"How long has she been unconscious?" someone else asked. 

The voice that was not Jacob's shocked me, jarred me into a more focused awareness. 

I realized that I was still. There was no tug of the current on me-the heaving was inside my 




head. The surface under me was flat and motionless. It felt grainy against my bare arms. 



"I don't know," Jacob reported, still frantic. His voice was very close. Hands-so warm they 
had to be his-brushed wet hair from my cheeks. "A few minutes? It didn't take long to tow 
her to the beach." 

The quiet whooshing inside my ears was not the waves-it was the air moving in and out of 
my lungs again. Each breath bumed-the passageways were as raw as if I'd scrubbed them out 
with steel wool. But I was breathing. 

And I was freezing. A thousand sharp, icy beads were striking my face and arms, making the 
cold worse. 

"She's breathing. She'll come around. We should get her out of the cold, though. I don't l ik e 
the color she's turning. . . " I recognized Sam's voice this time. 

"You think it's okay to move her?" 

"She didn't hurt her back or anything when she fell?" 

"I don't know." 

They hesitated. 

I tried to open my eyes. It took me a minute, but then I could see the dark, purple clouds, 
flinging the freezing rain down at me. "Jake?" I croaked. 

Jacob's face blocked out the sky. "Oh!" he gasped, relief washing over his features. His eyes 
were wet from the rain. "Oh, Bella! Are you okay? Can you hear me? Do you hurt 
anywhere?" 

"J-Just m-my throat," I stuttered, my lips quivering from the cold. 

"Let's get you out of here, then," Jacob said. He slid his arms under me and lifted me without 
effort-l ik e picking up an empty box. His chest was bare and warm; he hunched his shoulders 
to keep the rain off of me. My head lolled over his arm. I stared vacantly back toward the 
furious water, beating the sand behind him. 

"You got her?" I heard Sam ask. 

"Yeah, I'll take it from here. Get back to the hospital. I'll join you later. Thanks, Sam." 

My head was still rolling. None of his words sunk in at first. Sam didn't answer. There was 
no sound, and I wondered if he were already gone. 

The water licked and writhed up the sand after us as Jacob carried me away, like it was angry 
that I'd escaped. As I stared wearily, a spark of color caught my unfocused eyes-a small flash 
of fire was dancing on the black water, far out in the bay. The image made no sense, and I 




wondered how conscious I really was. My head swirled with the memory of the black, 
churning water-of being so lost that I couldn't find up or down. So lost... but somehow 
Jacob... 

"How did you find me?" I rasped. 

"I was searching for you," he told me. He was half-jogging through the rain, up the beach 
toward the road. "I followed the tire tracks to your truck, and then I heard you scream. . . " He 
shuddered. "Why would you jump, Bella? Didn't you notice that it's turning into a hurricane 
out here? Couldn't you have waited for me?" Anger filled his tone as the relief faded. 

"Sorry," I muttered. "It was stupid." 

"Yeah, it was really stupid," he agreed, drops of rain shaking free of his hair as he nodded. 
"Look, do you mind saving the stupid stuff for when I'm around? I won't be able to 
concentrate if I think you're jumping off cliffs behind my back." 

"Sure," I agreed. "No problem." I sounded l ik e a chain-smoker. I tried to clear my throat-and 
then winced; the throat-clearing felt l ik e stabbing a knife down there. "What happened 
today? Did you... find her?" It was my turn to shudder, though I wasn't so cold here, right 
next to his ridiculous body heat. 

Jacob shook his head. He was still more running than walking as he headed up the road to 
his house. "No. She took off into the water-the bloodsuckers have the advantage there. 
That's why I raced home-I was afraid she was going to double back swimming. You spend 
so much time on the beach. . . " He trailed off, a catch in his throat. 

"Sam came back with you... is everyone else home, too?" I hoped they weren't still out 
searching for her. 

"Yeah. Sort of." 

I tried to read his expression, squinting into the hammering rain. His eyes were tight with 
worry or pain. 

The words that hadn't made sense before suddenly did. "You said... hospital. Before, to 
Sam. Is someone hurt? Did she fight you?" My voice jumped up an octave, sounding strange 
with the hoarseness. 

"No, no. When we got back, Em was waiting with the news. It's Harry Clearwater. Harry 
had a heart attack this morning." 

"Harry?" I shook my head, trying to absorb what he was staying. "Oh, no! Does Charlie 
know?" 



Yeah. He's over there, too, with my dad. 




"Is Harry going to be okay?" 

Jacob's eyes tightened again. "It doesn't look so great right now." 

Abruptly, I felt really sick with guilt-felt truly horrible about the brainless cliff dive. Nobody 
needed to be worrying about me right now. What a stupid time to be reckless. 

"What can I do?" I asked. 

At that moment the rain stopped. I hadn't realized we were already back to Jacob's house 
until he walked through the door. The storm pounded against the roof. 

"You can stay here," Jacob said as he dumped me on the short couch. "I mean it-right here 
I'll get you some dry clothes." 

I let my eyes adjust to the dark room while Jacob banged around in his bedroom. The 
cramped front room seemed so empty without Billy, almost desolate. It was strangely 
ominous-probably just because I knew where he was. 

Jacob was back in seconds. He threw a pile of gray cotton at me. "These will be huge on you, 
but it's the best I've got. I'll, er, step outside so you can change." 

"Don't go anywhere. I'm too tired to move yet. Just stay with me." 

Jacob sat on the floor next to me, his back against the couch. I wondered when he'd slept 
last. He looked as exhausted as I felt. 

He leaned his head on the cushion next to mine and yawned. "Guess I could rest for a 
minute..." 

His eyes closed. I let mine slide shut, too. 

Poor Harry. Poor Sue. I knew Charlie was going to be beside himself. Harry was one of his 
best friends. Despite Jake's negative take on things, I hoped fervently that Harry would pull 
through. For Charlie's sake. For Sue's and Leah's and Seth's. . . 

Billy's sofa was right next to the radiator, and I was warm now, despite my soaked clothes. 
My lungs ached in a way that pushed me toward unconsciousness rather than keeping me 
awake. I wondered vaguely if it was wrong to sleep... or was I getting drowning mixed up 
with concussions... ? Jacob began softly snoring, and the sound of it soothed like a lullaby. I 
fell asleep quickly. 

For the first time in a very long time, my dream was just a normal dream. Just a blurred 
wandering through old memories-blinding bright visions of the Phoenix sun, my mother's 
face, a ramshackle tree house, a faded quilt, a wall of mirrors, a flame on the black water. . . I 
forgot each of them as soon as the picture changed. 




The last picture was the only one that stuck in my head. It was meaningless-just a set on a 
stage. A balcony at night, a painted moon hanging in the sky. I watched the girl in her 
nightdress lean on the railing and talk to herself. 

Meaningless. . . but when I slowly struggled back to consciousness, Juliet was on my mind. 

Jacob was still asleep; he'd slumped down to the floor and his breathing was deep and even. 
The house was darker now than before, it was black outside the window. I was stiff, but 
warm and almost dry. The inside of my throat burned with every breath I took. 

I was going to have to get up-at least to get a drink. But my body just wanted tc he here 
limp, to never move again. 

Instead of moving, I thought about Juliet some more. 

I wondered what she would have done if Romeo had left her, not because he was banished, 
but because he lost interests What if Rosalind had given him the time of day, and he'd 
changed his mind? What if, instead of marrying Juliet, he'd just disappeared? 

I thought I knew how Juliet would feel. 

She wouldn't go back to her old life, not really. She wouldn't ever have moved on, I was sure 
of that. Even if she'd lived until she was old and gray, every time she closed her eyes, it 
would have been Romeo's face she saw behind her lids. She would have accepted that, 
eventually. 

I wondered if she would have married Paris in the end, just to please her parents, to keep the 
peace. No, probably not, I decided. But then, the story didn't say much about Paris. He was 
just a stick figure-a placeholder, a threat, a deadline to force her hand. 

What if there were more to Paris? 

What if Paris had been Juliet's friend? Her very best friend? What if he was the only one she 
could confide in about the whole devastating thing with Romeo? The one person who really 
understood her and made her feel halfway human again? What if he was patient and kind? 
What if he took care of her? What if Juliet knew she couldn't survive without him? What if 
he really loved her, and wanted her to be happy? 

And... what if she loved Paris? Not l ik e Romeo. Nothing like that, of course. But enough 
that she wanted him to be happy, too? 

Jacob's slow, deep breathing was the only sound in the room-l ik e a lullaby hummed to a 
child, l ik e the whisper of a rocking chair, like the ticking of an old clock when you had 
nowhere you needed to go. . .It was the sound of comfort. 



If Romeo was really gone, never coming back, would it have mattered whether or not Juliet 
had taken Paris up on his offer? Maybe she should have tried to settle into the leftover scraps 




of life that were left behind. Maybe that would have been as close to happiness as she could 
get. 

I sighed, and then groaned when the sigh scraped my throat. I was reading too much into the 
story. Romeo wouldn't change his mind. That's why people still remembered his name, 
always twined with hers: Romeo and Juliet. That's why it was a good story. "Juliet gets 
dumped and ends up with Paris" would have never been a hit. 

I closed my eyes and drifted again, letting my mind wander away from the stupid play I didn't 
want to think about anymore. I thought about reality instead-about jumping off the cliff and 
what a brainless mistake that had been. And not just the cliff, but the motorcycles and the 
whole irresponsible Evel Knievel bit. What if something bad happened to me? What would 
that do to Charlie? Harry's heart attack had pushed everything suddenly into perspective for 
me. Perspective that I didn't want to see, because-if I admitted to the truth of it-it would 
mean that I would have to change my ways. Could I live l ik e that? 

Maybe. It wouldn't be easy; in fact, it would be downright miserable to give up my 
hallucinations and try to be a grown-up. But maybe I should do it. And maybe I could. If I 
had Jacob. 

I couldn't make that decision right now. It hurt too much. I'd think about something else. 

Images from my ill-considered afternoon stunt rolled through my head while I tried to come 
up with something pleasant to think about... the feel of the air as I fell, the blackness of the 
water, the thrashing of the current. . . Edward's face. . . I lingered there for a long time. Jacob's 
warm hands, trying to beat life back into me... the stinging rain flung down by the purple 
clouds. . . the strange fire on the waves. . . 

There was something familiar about that flash of color on top of the water. Of course it 
couldn't really be fire- 

My thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a car squelching through the mud on the road 
outside. I heard it stop in front of the house, and doors started opening and closing. I thought 
about sitting up, and then decided against that idea. 

Billy's voice was easily identifiable, but he kept it uncharacteristically low, so that it was only 
a gravelly grumble. 

The door opened, and the light flicked on. I blinked, momentarily blind. Jake startled awake, 
gasping and jumping to his feet. 

"Sorry," Billy grunted. "Did we wake you?" 

My eyes slowly focused on his face, and then, as I could read his expression, they filled with 
tears. 



Oh, no, Billy!" I moaned. 




He nodded slowly, his expression hard with grief. Jake hurried to his father and took one of 
his hands. The pain made his face suddenly childl ik e— it looked odd on top of the man's body. 

Sam was right behind Billy, pushing his chair through the door. His normal composure was 
absent from his agonized face. 

"I'm so sorry," I whispered. 

Billy nodded. "It's gonna be hard all around." 

"Where's Charlie?" 

"Your dad is still at the hospital with Sue. There are a lot of. . . arrangements to be made." 

I swallowed hard. 

"I'd better get back there," Sam mumbled, and he ducked hastily out the door. 

Billy pulled his hand away from Jacob, and then he rolled himself through the kitchen toward 
his room. 

Jake stared after him for a minute, then came to sit on the floor beside me again. He put his 
face in his hands. I rubbed his shoulder, wishing I could think of anything to say. 

After a long moment, Jacob caught my hand and held it to his face. 

"How are you feeling? Are you okay? I probably should have taken you to a doctor or 
something." He sighed. 

"Don't worry about me," I croaked. 

He twisted his head to look at me. His eyes were rimmed in red. "You don't look so good." 

"I don't feel so good, either, I guess." 

"I'll go get your truck and then take you home-you probably ought to be there when Charlie 
gets back." 

"Right." 

I lay listlessly on the sofa while I waited for him. Billy was silent in the other room. I felt l ik e 
a peeping tom, peering through the cracks at a private sorrow that wasn't mine. 

It didn't take Jake long. The roar of my truck's engine broke the silence before I expected it. 
He helped me up from the couch without speaking, keeping his arm around my shoulder 
when the cold air outside made me shiver. He took the driver's seat without asking, and then 
pulled me next to his side to keep his arm tight around me. I leaned my head against his 
chest. 




How will you get home?" I asked. 



"I'm not going home. We still haven't caught the bloodsucker, remember?" 

My next shudder had nothing to do with cold. 

It was a quiet ride after that. The cold air had woken me up. My mind was alert, and it was 
working very hard and very fast. 

What if? What was the right thing to do? 

I couldn't imagine my life without Jacob now-I cringed away from the idea of even trying to 
imagine that. Somehow, he'd become essential to my survival. But to leave things the way 
they were. . . was that cruel, as Mike had accused? 

I remembered wishing that Jacob were my brother. I realized now that all I really wanted was 
a claim on him. It didn't feel brotherly when he held me like this. It just felt nice-warm and 
comforting and familiar. Safe. Jacob was a safe harbor. 

I could stake a claim. I had that much within my power. 

I'd have to tell him everything, I knew that. It was the only way to be fair. I'd have to explain 
it right, so that he'd know I wasn't settling, that he was much too good for me. He already 
knew I was broken, that part wouldn't surprise him, but he'd need to know the extent of it. 
I'd even have to admit that I was crazy-explain about the voices I heard. He'd need to know 
everything before he made a decision. 

But, even as I recognized that necessity, I knew he would take me in spite of it all. He 
wouldn't even pause to think it through. 

I would have to commit to this-commit as much of me as there was left, every one of the 
broken pieces. It was the only way to be fair to him. Would I? Could I? 

Would it be so wrong to try to make Jacob happy? Even if the love I felt for him was no 
more than a weak echo of what I was capable of, even if my heart was far away, wandering 
and grieving after my fickle Romeo, would it be so very wrong? 

Jacob stopped the truck in front of my dark house, cutting the engine so it was suddenly 
silent. Like so many other times, he seemed to be in tune with my thoughts now. 

He threw his other arm around me, crushing me against his cheat, binding me to him. Again, 
this felt nice. Almost like being a whole person again. 

I thought he would be thinking of Harry, but then he spoke, and his tone was apologetic. 
"Sorry. I know you don't feel exactly the way I do, Bella. I swear I don't mind. I'm just so 
glad you're okay that I could sing-and that's something no one wants to hear." He laughed 
his throaty laugh in my ear. 




My breathing kicked up a notch, sanding the walls of my throat. 

Wouldn't Edward, indifferent as he might be, want me to be as happy as possible under the 
circumstances? Wouldn't enough friendly emotion linger for him to want that much for me? 
I thought he would. He wouldn't begrudge me this: giving just a small bit of love he didn't 
want to my friend Jacob. After all, it wasn't the same love at all. 

Jake pressed his warm cheek against the top of my hair. 

If I turned my face to the side-if I pressed my lips against his bare shoulder... I knew without 
any doubt what would follow. It would be very easy. There would be no need for 
explanations tonight. 

But could I do it? Could I betray my absent heart to save my pathetic life? 

Butterflies assaulted my stomach as I thought of turning my head. 

And then, as clearly as if I were in immediate danger, Edward's velvet voice whispered in my 
ear. 



"Be happy," he told me. 

I froze. 

Jacob felt me stiffen and released me automatically, reaching for the door. 

Wait, I wanted to say. Just a minute. But I was still locked in place, listening to the echo of 
Edward's voice in my head. 

Storm-cooled air blew through the cab of the truck. 

"OH!" The breath whooshed out of Jacob l ik e someone had punched him in the gut. "Holy 
crap\" 

He slammed the door and twisted the keys in the ignition at the same moment. His hands 
were shaking so hard I didn't know how he managed it. 

"What's wrong?" 

He revved the engine too fast; it sputtered and faltered. 

"Vampire," he spit out. 

The blood rushed from my head and left me dizzy. "How do you know?" 

"Because I can smell it. Dammit!" 



Jacob's eyes were wild, raking the dark street. He barely seemed aware of the tremors that 




were rolling through his body. "Phase or get her out of here?" he hissed at himself. 



He looked down at me for a split second, taking in my horror-struck eyes and white face, and 
then he was scanning the street again. "Right. Get you out." 

The engine caught with a roar. The tires squealed as he spun the truck around, turning 
toward our only escape. The headlights washed across the pavement, lit the front line of the 
black forest, and finally glinted off a car parked across the street from my house. 

"Stop!" I gasped. 

It was a black car-a car I knew. I might be the furthest thing from an autophile, but I could 
tell you everything about that particular car. It was a Mercedes S55 AMG. I knew the 
horsepower and the color of the interior. I knew the feel of the powerful engine purring 
through the frame. I knew the rich smell of the leather seats and the way the extra-dark tint 
made noon look l ik e dusk through those windows. 

It was Carlisle's car. 

"Stop!" I cried again, louder this time, because Jacob was gunning the truck down the street. 
"What?!" 

"It's not Victoria. Stop, stop! I want to go back." 

He stomped on the brake so hard I had to catch myself against the dashboard. 

"What?" he asked again, aghast. He stared at me with horror in his eyes. 

"It's Carlisle's car! It's the Cullens. I know it." 

He watched dawn break across my face, and a violent tremor rocked his frame. 

"Hey, calm down, Jake. It's okay. No danger, see? Relax." 

"Yeah, calm," he panted, putting his head down and closing his eyes. While he concentrated 
on not exploding into a wolf, I stared out the back window at the black car. 

It was just Carlisle, I told myself. Don't expect anything more. Maybe Esme... Stop right 
there, I told myself. Just Carlisle. That was plenty. More than I'd ever hoped to have again. 

"There's a vampire in your house," Jacob hissed. "And you want to go back?" 

I glanced at him, ripping my unwilling eyes off the Mercedes-terrified that it would disappear 
the second I looked away. 

"Of course," I said, my voice blank with surprise at his question. Of course I wanted to go 
back. 




Jacob's face hardened while I stared at him, congealing into the bitter mask that I'd thought 
was gone for good. Just before he had the mask in place, I caught the spasm of betrayal that 
flashed in his eyes. His hands were still shaking. He looked ten years older than me. 

He took a deep breath. "You're sure it's not a trick?" he asked in a slow, heavy voice. 

"It's not a trick. It's Carlisle. Take me back!" 

A shudder rippled through his wide shoulders, but his eyes were flat and emotionless. "No." 
"Jake, it's okay-" 

"No. Take yourself back, Bella." His voice was a slap-I flinched as the sound of it struck me. 
His jaw clenched and unclenched. 

"Look, Bella," he said in the same hard voice. "I can't go back. Treaty or no treaty, that's my 
enemy in there." 

"It's not l ik e that-" 

"I have to tell Sam right away. This changes things. We can't be caught on their territory." 
"Jake, it's not a war!" 

He didn't listen. He put the truck in neutral and jumped out the door, leaving it running. 

"Bye, Bella," he called back over his shoulder. "I really hope you don't die." He sprinted into 
the darkness, shaking so hard that his shape seemed blurred; he disappeared before I could 
open my mouth to call him back. 

Remorse pinned me against the seat for one long second. What had I just done to Jacob'? 

But remorse couldn't hold me very long. 

I slid across the seat and put the truck back in drive. My hands were shaking almost as hard 
as Jake's had been, and this took a minute of concentration. Then I carefully turned the truck 
around and drove it back to my house. 

It was very dark when I turned off the headlights. Charlie had left in such a hurry that he'd 
forgotten to leave the porch lamp on. I felt a pang of doubt, staring at the house, deep in 
shadow. What if it was a trick? 

I looked back at the black car, almost invisible in the night. No. I knew that car. 

Still, my hands were shaking even worse than before as I reached for the key above the door. 
When I grabbed the doorknob to unlock it, it twisted easily under my hand. I let the door fall 
open. The hallway was black. 




I wanted to call out a greeting, but my throat was too dry. I couldn't quite seem to catch my 
breath. 



I took a step inside and fumbled for the light switch. It was so black-like the black water. . . 
Where was that switch? 

Just l ik e the black water, with the orange flame flickering impossibly on top of it. Flame that 
couldn't be a fire, but what then. . . ? My fingers traced the wall, still searching, still shaking- 

Suddenly, something Jacob had told me this afternoon echoed in my head, finally sinking 
in... She took off into the water , he'd said. The bloodsuckers have the advantage there. That's 
why I raced home-I was afraid she was going to double back swimming. 

My hand froze in its searching, my whole body froze into place, as I realized why I 
recognized the strange orange color on the water. 

Victoria's hair, blowing wild in the wind, the color of fire. . . 

She'd been right there. Right there in the harbor with me and Jacob. If Sam hadn't been 
there, if it had been just the two of us. . . ? I couldn't breathe or move. 

The light flicked on, though my frozen hand had still not found the switch. 

I blinked into the sudden light, and saw that someone was there, waiting for me. 




17. VISITOR 



UNNATURALLY STILL AND WHITE, WITH LARGE BLACK EYES intent on my 
face, my visitor waited perfectly motionless in the center of the halt, beautiful beyond 
imagining. 

My knees trembled for a second, and I nearly fell. Then I hurled myself at her. 

"Alice, oh, Alice!" I cried, as I slammed into her. 

I'd forgotten how hard she was; it was l ik e running headlong into a wall of cement. 

"Bella?" There was a strange mingling of relief and confusion in her voice. 

I locked my arms around her, gasping to inhale as much of the scent of her skin as possible. It 
wasn't like anything else-not floral or spice, citrus or musk. No perfume in the world could 
compare. My memory hadn't done it justice. 

I didn't notice when the gasping turned into something else-I only realized I was sobbing 
when Alice dragged me to the living room couch and pulled me into her lap. It was l ik e 
curling up into a cool stone, but a stone that was contoured comfortingly to the shape of my 
body. She rubbed my back in a gentle rhythm, waiting for me to get control of myself. 

"I'm... sorry," I blubbered. "I'm just... so happy... to see you!" 

"It's okay, Bella. Everything's okay." 

"Yes," I bawled. And, for once, it seemed that way. 

Alice sighed. "I'd forgotten how exuberant you are," she said, and her tone was disapproving. 

I looked up at her through my streaming eyes. Alice's neck was tight, straining away from 
me, her lips pressed together firmly. Her eyes were black as pitch. 

"Oh," I puffed, as I realized the problem. She was thirsty. And I smelled appetizing. It had 
been a while since I'd had to think about that kind of thing. "Sorry." 

"It's my own fault. It's been too long since I hunted. I shouldn't let myself get so thirsty. But I 
was in a hurry today." The look she directed at me then was a glare. "Speaking of which, 
would you like to explain to me how you're alive?" 

That brought me up short and stopped the sobs. I realized what must have happened 
immediately, and why Alice was here. 

I swallowed loudly. "You saw me fall." 

"No," she disagreed, her eyes narrowing. "I saw you jump." 




I pursed my lips as I tried to think of an explanation that wouldn't sound nuts. 

Alice shook her head. "I told him this would happen, but he didn't believe me. 'Bella 
promised,"' her voice imitated his so perfectly that I iroze in shock while the pain ripped 
through my torso. "'Don't be looking for her future, either,"' she continued to quote him. 
"'We've done enough damage." 

"But just because I'm not looking, doesn't mean I don't see” she went on. "I wasn't keeping 
tabs on you, I swear, Bella. It's just that I'm alreacy attuned to you... when I saw you 
jumping, I didn't think, I just got on a plane. I knew I would be too late, but I couldn't do 
nothing. And then I get here, thinking maybe I could help Charlie somehow, and you drive 
up." She shook her head, this time in confusion. Her voice was strained. "I saw you go into 
the water and I waited and waited for you to come up, but you didn't. What happened? And 
how could you do that to Charlie? Did you stop to think what this would do to him? And my 
brother? Do you have any idea what Edward-" 

I cut her off then, as soon as she said his name. I'd let her go on, even after I realized the 
misunderstanding she was under, just to hear the perfect bell tone of her voice. But it was 
time to interrupt. 

"Alice, I wasn't committing suicide." 

She eyed me dubiously. "Are you saying you didn't jump off a cliff?" 

"No, but. . . " I grimaced. "It was for recreational purposes only." 

Her expression hardened. 

"I'd seen some of Jacob's friends c li ff diving," I insisted. "It looked like... fun, and I was 
bored..." 

She waited. 

"I didn't think about how the storm would affect the currents. Actually, I didn't think about 
the water much at all." 

Alice didn't buy it. I could see that she still thought I had been trying to kill myself. I decided 
to redirect. "So if you saw me go in, why didn't you see Jacob?" 

She cocked her head to the side, distracted. 

I continued. "It's true that I probably would have drowned if Jacob hadn't jumped in after me. 
Well, okay, there's no probably about it. But he did, and he pulled me out, and I guess he 
towed me back to shore, though I was kind of out for that part. It couldn't have been more 
than a minute that I was under before he grabbed me. How come you didn't see that?" 



She frowned in perplexity. "Someone pulled you out? 




Yes. Jacob saved me. 



I watched curiously as an enigmatic range of emotions flitted across her face. Something was 
bothering her-her imperfect vision? But I wasn't sure. Then she deliberately leaned in and 
sniffed my shoulder. 

I froze. 

"Don't be ridiculous," she muttered, sniffing at me some more. 

"What are you doing?" 

She ignored my question. "Who was with you out there just now? It sounded l ik e you were 
arguing." 

"Jacob Black. He's... sort of my best friend, I guess. At least, he was..." I thought of Jacob's 
angry, betrayed face, and wondered what he was to me now. 

Alice nodded, seeming preoccupied. 

"What?" 

"I don't know," she said. "I'm not sure what it means." 

"Well, I'm not dead, at least." 

She rolled her eyes. "He was a fool to think you could survive alone. I've never seen anyone 
so prone to life-threatening idiocy." 

"I survived," I pointed out. 

She was thinking of something else. "So, if the currents were too much for you, how did this 
Jacob manage?" 

"Jacob is... strong." 

She heard the reluctance in my voice, and her eyebrows rose. 

I gnawed on my lip for a second. Was this a secret, or not? And if it was, then who was my 
greatest allegiance to? Jacob, or Alice? 

It was too hard to keep secrets, I decided. Jacob knew everything, why not Alice, too? 

"See, well, he's... sort of a werewolf," I admitted in a rush. "The Quileutes turn into wolves 
when there are vampires around. They know Carlisle from a long time ago. Were you with 
Carlisle back then?" 

Alice gawked at me for a moment, and then recovered herself, blinking rapidly. "Well, I 




guess that explains the smell," she muttered. "But does it explain what I didn't see?" She 
frowned, her porcelain forehead creasing. 

"The smell?" I repeated. 

"You smell awful," she said absently, still frowning. "A werewolf? Are you sure about that?" 

"Very sure," I promised, wincing as I remembered Paul and Jacob fighting in the road. "I 
guess you weren't with Carlisle the last time there were werewolves here in Forks?" 

"No. I hadn't found him yet." Alice was still lost in thought. Suddenly, her eyes widened, and 
she turned to stare at me with a shocked expression. "Your best friend is a werewolf?" 

I nodded sheepishly. 

"How long has this been going on?" 

"Not long," I said, my voice sounding defensive. "He's only been a werewolf for just a few 
weeks." 

She glowered at me. "A young werewolf? Even worse! Edward was right-you're a magnet 
for danger. Weren't you supposed to be staying out of trouble?" 

"There's nothing wrong with werewolves," I grumbled, stung by her critical tone. 

"Until they lose their tempers." She shook her head sharply from side to side. "Leave it to 
you, Bella. Anyone else would be better off when the vampires left town. But you have to 
start hanging out with the first monsters you can find." 

I didn't want to argue with Alice-I was still trembling with joy that she was really, truly here, 
that I could touch her marble skin and hear her wind-chime voice-but she had it all wrong. 

"No, Alice, the vampires didn't really leave-not all of them, anyway. That's the whole 
trouble. If it weren't for the werewolves, Victoria would have gotten me by now. Well, if it 
weren't for Jake and his friends, Laurent would have gotten me before she could, I guess, 
so-" 

"Victoria?" she hissed. "Laurent?" 

I nodded, a teensy bit alarmed by the expression in her black eyes. I pointed at my chest. 
"Danger magnet, remember?" 

She shook her head again. "Tell me everything-start at the beginning." 

I glossed over the beginning, skipping the motorcycles and the voices, but telling her 
everything else right up to today's misadventure. Alice didn't l ik e my thin explanation about 
boredom and the cliffs, so I hurried on to the strange flame I'd seen on the water and what I 
thought it meant. Her eyes narrowed almost to slits at that part. It was strange to see her 




look so... so dangerous-like a vampire. I swallowed hard and went on with the rest about 
Harry. 

She listened to my story without interrupting. Occasionally, she would shake her head, and 
the crease in her forehead deepened until it looked l ik e it was carved permanently into the 
marble of her skin. She didn't speak and, finally, I fell quiet, struck again by the borrowed 
grief at Harry's passing. I thought of Charlie; he would be home soon. What condition would 
he be in? 

"Our leaving didn't do you any good at all, did it?" Alice murmured. 

I laughed once-it was a slightly hysterical sound. "That was never the point, though, was it? 
It's not l ik e you left for my benefit." 

Alice scowled at the floor for a moment. "Well... I guess I acted impulsively today. I 
probably shouldn't have intruded." 

I could feel the blood draining from my face. My stomach dropped. "Don't go, Alice," I 
whispered. My fingers locked around the collar of her white shirt and I began to 
hyperventilate. "Please don't leave me." 

Her eyes opened wider. "All right," she said, enunciating each word with slow precision. "I'm 
not going anywhere tonight. Take a deep breath." 

I tried to obey, though I couldn't quite locate my lungs. 

She watched my face while I concentrated on my breathing. She waited till I was calmer to 
comment. 

"You look l ik e hell, Bella." 

"I drowned today," I reminded her. 

"It goes deeper than that. You're a mess." 

I flinched. "Look, I'm doing my best." 

"What do you mean?" 

"It hasn't been easy. I'm working on it." 

She frowned. "I told him," she said to herself. 

"Alice," I sighed. "What did you think you were going to find? I mean, besides me dead? Did 
you expect to find me skipping around and whistling show tunes? You know me better than 
that." 



'I do. But I hoped. 




"Then I guess I don't have the comer on the idiocy market." 

The phone rang. 

"That has to be Charlie," I said, staggering to my feet. I grabbed Alice's stone hand and 
dragged her with me to the kitchen. I wasn't about to let her out of my sight. 

"Charlie?" I answered the phone. 

"No, it's me," Jacob said. 

"Jake!" 

Alice scrutinized my expression. 

"Just making sure you were still alive," Jacob said sourly. 

"I'm fine. I told you that it wasn't-" 

"Yeah. I got it. 'Bye." 

Jacob hung up on me. 

I sighed and let my head hang back, staring at the ceiling. "That's going to be a problem." 
Alice squeezed my hand. "They aren't excited I'm here." 

"Not especially. But it's none of their business anyway." 

Alice put her arm around me. "So what do we do now?" she mused. She seemed to talk to 
herself for a moment. "Things to do. Loose ends to tie." 

"What things to do?" 

Her face was suddenly careful. "I don't know for sure. . . I need to see Carlisle." 

Would she leave so soon? My stomach dropped. 

"Could you stay?" I begged. "Please? For just a little while. I've missed you so much." My 
voice broke. 

"If you think that's a good idea." Her eyes were unhappy. 

"I do. You can stay here-Charlie would love that." 

"I have a house, Bella." 

I nodded, disappointed but resigned. She hesitated, studying me. 




"Well, I need to go get a suitcase of clothes, at the very least." 

I threw my arms around her. "Alice, you're the best!" 

"And I think I'll need to hunt. Immediately," she added in a strained voice. 

"Oops." I took a step back. 

"Can you stay out of trouble for one hour?" she asked skeptically. Then, before I could 
answer, she held up one finger and closed her eyes. Her face went smooth and blank for a 
few seconds. 

And then her eyes opened and she answered her own question. "Yes, you'll be fine. For 
tonight, anyway." She grimaced. Even making faces, she looked like an angel. 

"You'll come back?" I asked in a small voice. 

"I promise-one hour." 

I glanced at the clock over the kitchen table. She laughed and leaned in quickly to kiss me on 
the cheek. Then she was gone. 

I took a deep breath. Alice would be back. I suddenly felt so much better. 

I had plenty to do to keep myself busy while I waited. A shower was definitely first on the 
agenda. I sniffed my shoulders as I undressed, but I couldn't smell anything but the brine and 
seaweed scent of the ocean. I wondered what Alice had meant about me smelling bad. 

When I was cleaned up, I went back to the kitchen. I couldn't see any signs that Charlie 'lad 
eaten recently, and he would probably be hungry when he got back. I hummed tunelessly to 
myself as I moved around the kitchen. 

While Thursday's casserole rotated in the microwave, I made up the couch with sheets and 
an old pillow. Alice wouldn't need it, but Charlie would need to see it. I was careful not to 
watch the clock. There was no reason to start myself panicking; Alice had promised. 

I hurried through my dinner, not tasting it-just feeling the ache as it slid down my raw throat. 
Mostly I was thirsty; I must have drunk a half gallon of water by the time I was finished. All 
the salt in my system had dehydrated me. 

I went to go try to watch TV while I waited. 

Alice was already there, sitting on her improvised bed. Her eyes were a liquid butterscotch. 
She smiled and patted the pillow. "Thanks." 

"You're early," I said, elated. 

I sat down next to her and leaned my head on her shoulder. She put her cold arms around me 




and sighed. 

"Bella. What are we going to do with you?" 

"I don't know," I admitted. "I really have been trying my hardest." 

"I believe you." 

It was silent. 

"Does-does he..." I took a deep breath. It was harder to say his name out loud, even though 
I was able to think it now. "Does Edward know you're here?" I couldn't help asking. It was 
my pain, after all. I'd deal with it when she was gone, I promised myself, and felt sick at the 
thought. 

"No." 

There was only one way that could be true. "He's not with Carlisle and Esme?" 

"He checks in every few months." 

"Oh." He must still be out enjoying his distractions. I focused my curiosity on a safer topic. 
"You said you flew here. . . Where did you come from?" 

"I was in Denali. Visiting Tanya's family." 

"Is Jasper here? Did he come with your'" 

She shook her head. "He didn't approve of my interfering. We promised..." she trailed off, 
and then her tone changed. "And you think Charlie won't mind my being here?" she asked, 
sounding worried. 

"Charlie thinks you're wonderful, Alice." 

"Well, we're about to find out." 

Sure enough, a few seconds later I heard the cruiser pull into the driveway. I jumped up and 
hurried to open the door. 

Charlie trudged slowly up the walk, his eyes on the ground and his shoulders slumped. I 
walked forward to meet him; he didn't even see me until I hugged him around the waist. He 
embraced me back fiercely. 

"I'm so sorry about Harry, Dad." 

"I'm really going to miss him," Charlie mumbled. 



How's Sue doing?’ 




"She seems dazed, l ik e she hasn't grasped it yet. Sam's staying with her. . . " The volume of his 
voice faded in and out. "Those poor kids. Leah's just a year older than you, and Seth is only 
fourteen..." He shook his head. 

He kept his arms tight around me as he started toward the door again. 

"Um, Dad?" I figured I'd better warn him. "You'll never guess who's here." 

He looked at me blankly. His head swiveled around, and he spied the Mercedes across the 
street, the porch light reflecting off the glossy black paint. Before he could react, Alice was 
in the doorway. 

"Hi, Charlie," she said in a subdued voice. "I'm sorry I came at such a bad time." 

"Alice Cullen?" he peered at the slight figure in front of him as if he doubted what his eyes 
were telling him. "Alice, is that you?" 

"It's me," she confirmed. "I was in the neighborhood." 

"Is Carlisle...?" 

"No, I'm alone." 

Both Alice and I knew he wasn't really asking about Carlisle. His arm tightened over my 
shoulder. 

"She can stay here, can't she?" I pleaded. "I already asked her." 

"Of course," Charlie said mechanically. "We'd love to have you, Alice." 

"Thank you, Charlie. I know it's horrid timing." 

"No, it's fine, really. I'm going to be really busy doing what I can for Harry's family; it will be 
nice for Bella to have some company." 

"There's dinner for you on the table. Dad," I told him. 

"Thanks, Bell." He gave me one more squeeze before he shuffled toward the kitchen. 

Alice went back to the couch, and I followed her. This time, she was the one to pull me 
against her shoulder. 

"You look tired." 

"Yeah," I agreed, and shrugged. "Near-death experiences do that to me... So, what does 
Carlisle think of you being here?" 

"He doesn't know. He and Esme were on a hunting trip. I'll hear from h im in a few days, 




when he gets back. 



"You won't tell him, though... when he checks in again?" I asked. She knew I didn't mean 
Carlisle now. 

"No. He'd bite my head off," Alice said grimly. 

I laughed once, and then sighed. 

I didn't want to sleep. I wanted to stay up all night talking to Alice. And it didn't make sense 
for me to be tired, what with crashing on Jacob's couch all day. But drowning really had 
taken a lot out of me, and my eyes wouldn't stay open. I rested my head on her stone 
shoulder, and drifted into a more peaceful oblivion than I had any hope of. 

I woke early, from a deep and dreamless sleep, feeling well-rested, but stiff. I was on the 
couch tucked under the blankets I'd laid out for Alice, and I could hear her and Charlie 
talking in the kitchen. It sounded l ik e Charlie was fixing her breakfast. 

"How bad was it, Charlie?" Alice asked softly, and at first I thought they were talking about 
the Clearwaters. 

Charlie sighed. "Real bad." 

"Tell me about it. I want to know exactly what happened when we left." 

There was a pause while a cupboard door was closed and a dial on the stove was clicked off. 
I waited, cringing. 

"I've never felt so helpless," Charlie began slowly. "I didn't know what to do. That first 
week-I thought I was going to have to hospitalize her. She wouldn't eat or drink, she 
wouldn't move. Dr. Gerandy was throwing around words l ik e 'catatonic,' but I didn't let him 
up to see her. I was afraid it would scare her." 

"She snapped out of it though?" 

"I had Renee come to take her to Florida. I just didn't want to be the one. . . if she had to go 
to a hospital or something. I hoped being with her mother would help. But when we started 
packing her clothes, she woke up with a vengeance. I've never seen Bella throw a fit like 
that. She was never one for the tantrums, but, boy, did she fly into a fury. She threw her 
clothes everywhere and screamed that we couldn't make her leave-and then she finally 
started crying. I thought that would be the turning point. I didn't argue when she insisted on 
staying here. . . and she did seem to get better at first. . . " 

Charlie trailed off. It was hard listening to this, knowing how much pain I'd caused him. 
"But?" Alice prompted. 




"She went back to school and work, she ate and slept and did her homework. She answered 
when someone asked her a direct question. But she was... empty. Her eyes were blank. 
There were lots of little things-she wouldn't listen to music anymore; I found a bunch of 
CDs broken in the trash. She didn't read; she wouldn't be in the same room when the TV 
was on, not that she watched it so much before. I finally figured it out-she was avoiding 
everything that might remind her of. . . him. 

"We could hardly talk; I was so worried about saying something that would upset her-the 
littlest things would make her flinch-and she never volunteered anything. She would just 
answer if I asked her something. 

"She was alone all the time. She didn't call her friends back, and after a while, they stopped 
calling. 

"It was night of the living dead around here. I still hear her screaming in her sleep. . ." 

I could almost see him shuddering. I shuddered, too, remembering. And then I sighed. I 
hadn't fooled him at all, not for one second. 

"I'm so sorry, Charlie," Alice said, voice glum. 

"It's not your fault." The way he said it made it perfectly clear that he was holding someone 
responsible. "You were always a good friend to her." 

"She seems better now, though." 

"Yeah. Ever since she started hanging out with Jacob Black, I've noticed a real improvement. 
She has some color in her cheeks when she comes home, some light in her eyes. She's 
happier." He paused, and his voice was different when he spoke again. "He's a year or so 
younger than her, and I know she used to think of him as a friend, but I think maybe it's 
something more now, or headed that direction, anyway." Charlie said this in a tone that was 
almost belligerent. It was a warning, not for Alice, but for her to pass along. "Jake's old for 
his years," he continued, still sounding defensive. "He's taken care of his father physically the 
way Bella took care of her mother emotionally. It matured him. He's a good-looking kid, 
too-takes after his mom's side. He's good for Bella, you know," Charlie insisted. 

"Then it's good she has him," Alice agreed. 

Charlie sighed out a big gust of air, folding quickly to the lack of opposition. "Okay, so I 
guess that's overstating things. I don't know... even with Jacob, now and then I see 
something in her eyes, and I wonder if I've ever grasped how much pain she's really in It's not 
normal, Alice, and it... it frightens me. Not normal at all. Not l ik e someone... left her, but 
l ik e someone died." His voice cracked. 



It was l ik e someone had died-like / had died. Because it had been more than just losing the 
truest of true loves, as if that were not enough to kill anyone. It was also losing a whole 




future, a whole family-the whole life that I'd chosen. . . 



Charlie went on in a hopeless tone. "I don't know if she's going to get over it-I'm not sure if 
it's in her nature to heal from something like this. She's always been such a constant little 
thing. She doesn't get past things, change her mind." 

"She's one of a kind," Alice agreed in a dry voice. 

"And Alice..." Charlie hesitated. "Now, you know how fond I am of you, and I can tell that 
she's happy to see you, but. . . I'm a little worried about what your visit will do to her." 

"So am I, Charlie, so am 1. 1 wouldn't have come if I'd had any idea. I'm sorry." 

"Don't apologize, honey. Who knows? Maybe it will be good for her." 

"I hope you're right." 

There was a long break while forks scraped plates and Charlie chewed. I wondered where 
Alice was hiding the food. 

"Alice, I have to ask you something," Charlie said awkwardly. 

Alice was calm. "Go ahead." 

"He's not coming back to visit, too, is he?" I could hear the suppressed anger in Charlie's 
voice. 

Alice answered in a soft, reassuring tone. "He doesn't even know I'm here. The last time I 
spoke with him, he was in South America." 

I stiffened as I heard this new information, and listened harder. 

"That's something, at least." Charlie snorted. "Well, I hope he's enjoying himself." 

For the first time, Alice's voice had a bit of steel in it. "I wouldn't make assumptions, 
Charlie." I knew how her eyes would flash when she used that tone. 

A chair scooted from the table, scraping loudly across the floor. I pictured Charlie getting up; 
there was no way Alice would make that kind of noise. The faucet ran, splashing against a 
dish. 

It didn't sound like they were going to say anything more about Edward, so I decided it was 
time to wake up. 

I turned over, bouncing against the springs to make them squeak. Then I yawned loudly. 

All was quiet in the kitchen. 




I stretched and groaned. 

"Alice?" I asked innocently; the soreness rasping in my throat added nicely to the charade. 

"I'm in the kitchen, Bella," Alice called, no hint in her voice that she suspected my 
eavesdropping. But she was good at hiding things like that. 

Charlie had to leave then-he was helping Sue Clearwater with the funeral arrangements. It 
would have been a very long day without Alice. She never spoke about leaving, and I didn't 
ask her. I knew it was inevitable, but I put it out of my mind. 

Instead, we talked about her family-all but one. 

Carlisle was working nights in Ithaca and teaching part time at Cornell. Esme was restoring a 
seventeenth century house, a historical monument, in the forest north of the city. Emmett 
and Rosalie had gone to Europe for a few months on another honeymoon, but they were 
back now. Jasper was at Cornell, too, studying philosophy this time. And Alice had been 
doing some personal research, concerning the information I'd accidentally uncovered for her 
last spring. She'd successfully tracked down the asylum where she'd spent the last years of 
her human life. The life she had no memory of. 

"My name was Mary Alice Brandon," she told me quietly. "I had a little sister named Cynthia. 
Her daughter-my niece-is still alive in Biloxi." 

"Did you find out why they put you in... that place?" What would drive parents to that 
extreme? Even if their daughter saw visions of the future. . . 

She just shook her head, her topaz eyes thoughtful. "I couldn't find much about them. I went 
through all the old newspapers on microfiche. My family wasn't mentioned often; they 
weren't part of the social circle that made the papers. My parents' engagement was there, and 
Cynthia's." The name fell uncertainly from her tongue. "My birth was announced... and my 
death. I found my grave. I also filched my admissions sheet from the old asylum archives. The 
date on the admission and the date on my tombstone are the same." 

I didn't know what to say, and, after a short pause, Alice moved on to lighter topics. 

The Cullens were reassembled now, with the one exception, spending Cornell's spring break 
in Denali with Tanya and her family. I listened too eagerly to even the most trivial news. She 
never mentioned the one I was most interested in, and for that I was grateful. It was enough 
to listen to the stories of the family I'd once dreamed of belonging to. 

Charlie didn't get back until after dark, and he looked more worn than he had the night 
before. He would be headed back to the reservation first thing in the morning for Harry's 
funeral, so he turned in early. I stayed on the couch with Alice again. 




Charlie was almost a stranger when he came down the stairs before the sun was up, wearing 
an old suit I'd never seen him in before. The jacket hung open; I guessed it was too tight to 
fasten the buttons. His tie was a bit wide for the current style. He tiptoed to the door, trying 
not to wake us up. I let him go, pretending to sleep, as Alice did on the recliner. 

As soon as he was out the door, Alice sat up. Under the quilt, she was fully dressed. 

"So, what are we doing today?" she asked. 

"I don't know-do you see anything interesting happening?" 

She smiled and shook her head. "But it's still early." 

All the time I'd been spending in La Push meant a pile of things I'd been neglecting at home, 
and I decided to catch up on my chores. I wanted to do something, anything that might make 
life easier for Charlie-maybe it would make him feel just a little better to come home to a 
clean, organized house. I started with the bathroom-it showed the most signs of neglect. 

While I worked, Alice leaned against the doorjamb and asked nonchalant questions about 
my, well, our high school friends and what they been up to since she'd left. Her face stayed 
casual and emotionless, but I sensed her disapproval when she realized how little I could tell 
her. Or maybe I just had a guilty conscience after eavesdropping on her conversation with 
Charlie yesterday morning. 

I was literally up to my elbows in Comet, scrubbing the floor of the bathtub, when the 
doorbell rang. 

I looked to Alice at once, and her expression was perplexed, almost worried, which was 
strange; Alice was never taken by surprise. 

"Hold on!" I shouted in the general direction of the front door, getting up and hurrying to the 
sink to rinse my arms off. 

"Bella," Alice said with a trace of frustration in her voice, "I have a fairly good guess who 
that might be, and I think I'd better step out." 

"Guess?" I echoed. Since when did Alice have to guess anything? 

"If this is a repeat of my egregious lapse in foresight yesterday, then it's most likely Jacob 
Black or one of his. . . friends." 

I stared at her, putting it together. "You can't see werewolves?" 

She grimaced. "So it would seem." She was obviously annoyed by this fact-very annoyed. 

The doorbell rang again-buzzing twice quickly and impatiently. 




You don't have go anywhere, Alice. You were here first. 



She laughed her silvery little laugh-it had a dark edge. "Trust me-it wouldn't be a good idea 
to have me and Jacob Black in a room together." 

She kissed my cheek swiftly before she vanished through Charlie's door-and out his back 
window, no doubt. 

The doorbell rang again. 




18. THE FUNERAL 



I SPRINTED DOWN THE STAIRS AND THREW THE DOOR open. 

It was Jacob, of course. Even blind, Alice wasn't slow. 

He was standing about six feet back from the door, his nose wrinkled in distaste, but his face 
otherwise smooth-masklike. He didn't fool me; I could see the faint trembling of his hands. 

Hostility rolled off of him in waves. It brought back that awful afternoon when he'd chosen 
Sam over me, and I felt my chin jerk up defensively in response. 

Jacob's Rabbit idled by the curb with Jared behind the wheel and Embry in the passenger 
seat. I understood what this meant: they were afraid to let him come here alone. It made me 
sad, and a little annoyed. The Cullens weren't l ik e that. 

"Hey," I finally said when he didn't speak. 

Jake pursed his lips, still hanging back from the door. His eyes flickered across the front of 
the house. 

I ground my teeth. "She's not here. Do you need something?" 

He hesitated. "You're alone?" 

"Yes." I sighed. 

"Can I talk to you a minute?" 

"Of course you can, Jacob. Come on in." 

Jacob glanced over his shoulder at his friends in the car. I saw Embry shake his head just a 
tiny bit. For some reason, this bugged me to no end. 

My teeth clenched together again. "Chicken ” I mumbled under my breath. 

Jake's eyes flashed back to me, his thick, black brows pushing into a furious angle over his 
deep-set eyes. His jaw set, and he marched-there was no other way to describe the way he 
moved-up the sidewalk and shrugged past me into the house. 

I locked gazes with first Jared and then Embry-I didn't l ik e the hard way they eyed me; did 
they really think I would let anything hurt Jacob ?-before I shut the door on them. 



Jacob was in the hall behind me, staring at the mess of blankets in the living room. 

"Slumber party?" he asked, his tone sarcastic. 

"Yeah," I answered with the same level of acid. I didn't like Jacob when he acted this way. 




'What's it to you?’ 



He wrinkled his nose again like he smelled something unpleasant. "Where's your 'friend'?" I 
could hear the quotation marks in his tone. 

"She had some errands to run. Look, Jacob, what do you want?" 

Something about the room seemed to make him edgier-his long arms were quivering. He 
didn't answer my question. Instead he moved on to the kitchen, his restless eyes darting 
everywhere. 

I followed him. He paced back and forth along the short counter. 

"Hey," I said, putting myself in his way. He stopped pacing and stared down at me. "What's 
your problem?" 

"I don't like having to be here." 

That stung. I winced, and his eyes tightened. 

"Then I'm sorry you had to come," I muttered. "Why don't you tell me what you need so you 
can leave?" 

"I just have to ask you a couple of questions. It shouldn't take long. We have to get back for 
the funeral." 

"Okay. Get it over with then." I was probably overdoing it with the antagonism, but I didn't 
want him to see how much this hurt. I knew I wasn't being fair. After all. I'd picked the 
bloodsucker over him last night. I'd hurt him first. 

He took a deep breath, and his trembling fingers were suddenly still. His face smoothed into 
a serene mask. 

"One of the Cullens is staying here with you," he stated. 

"Yes. Alice Cullen." 

He nodded thoughtfully. "How long is she here for?" 

"As long as she wants to be." The belligerence was still there in my tone. "It's an open 
invitation." 

"Do you think you could. . . please. . . explain to her about the other one- Victoria?" 

I paled. "I told her about that." 

He nodded. "You should know that we can only watch our own lands with a Cullen here. 
You'll only be safe in La Push. I can't protect you here anymore." 




"Okay," I said in a small voice. 

He looked away then, out the back windows. He didn't continue. 

"Is that all?" 

He kept his eyes on the glass as he answered. "Just one more thing." 

I waited, but he didn't continue. "Yes?" I finally prompted. 

"Are the rest of them coming back now?" he asked in a cool, quiet voice. It reminded me of 
Sam's always calm manner. Jacob was becoming more l ik e Sam... I wondered why that 
bothered me so much. 

Now / didn't speak. He looked back at my face with probing eyes. 

"Well?" he asked. He struggled to conceal the tension behind his serene expression. 

"No." I said finally. Grudgingly. "They aren't coming back." 

His expression didn't change. "Okay. That's all." 

I glared at him, annoyance rekindled. "Well, run along now. Go tell Sam that the scary 
monsters aren't coming to get you." 

"Okay," he repeated, still calm. 

That seemed to be it. Jacob walked swiftly from the kitchen. I waited to hear the front door 
open, but I heard nothing. I could hear the clock over the stove ticking, and I marveled again 
at how quiet he'd become. 

What a disaster. How could I have alienated him so completely in such a short amount of 
time? 

Would he forgive me when Alice was gone? What if he didn't? 

I slumped against the counter and buried my face in my hands. How had I made such a mess 
of everything? But what could I have done differently? Even in hindsight, I couldn't think of 
any better way, any perfect course of action. 

"Bella. . . ?" Jacob asked in a troubled voice. 

I pulled my face out of my hands to see Jacob hesitating in the kitchen doorway; he hadn't 
left when I'd thought. It was only when I saw the clear drops sparkling in my hands that I 
realized I was crying. 



Jacob's calm expression was gone; his face was anxious and unsure. He walked quickly back 
to stand in front of me, ducking his head so that his eyes were closer to being on the same 




level with mine. 



"Did it again, didn't I?" 

"Did what?" I asked, my voice cracking. 

"Broke my promise. Sorry." 

'"S'okay," I mumbled. "I started it this time." 

His face twisted. "I knew how you felt about them. It shouldn't have taken me by surprise 
l ik e that." 

I could see the revulsion in his eyes. I wanted to explain to him what Alice was really like, to 
defend her against the judgments he'd made, but something warned me that now was not the 
time. 

So I just said, "Sorry," again. 

"Let's not worry about it, okay? She's just visiting, right? She'll leave, and things will go 
back to normal." 

"Can't I be friends with you both at the same time?" I asked, my voice not hiding an ounce of 
the hurt I felt. 

He shook his head slowly. "No, I don't think you can." 

I sniffed and stared at his big feet. "But you'll wait, right? You'll still be my friend, even 
though I love Alice, too?" 

I didn't look up, afraid to see what he'd think of that last part. It took him a minute to 
answer, so I was probably right not to look. 

"Yeah, I'll always be your friend," he said gruffly. "No matter what you love." 

"Promise?" 

"Promise." 

I felt his arms wind around me, and I leaned against his chest, still sniffling. "This sucks." 
"Yeah." Then he sniffed my hair and said, "Ew." 

"WhatT I demanded. I looked up to see that his nose was wrinkled again. "Why does 
everyone keep doing that to me? I don't smell!" 

He smiled a little. "Yes, you do-you smell l ik e them. Blech. Too sweet-sickly sweet. And... 
icy. It bums my nose." 




"Really?" That was strange. Alice smelled unbelievably wonderful. To a human, anyway. 
"But why would Alice think I smelled, too, then?" 

That wiped his smile away. "Huh. Maybe I don't smell so good to her, either. Huh." 

"Well, you both smell fine to me." I rested my head against him again. I was going to miss 
him terribly when he walked out my door. It was a nasty catch-22-on the one hand, I wanted 
Alice to stay forever. I was going to die-metaphorically-when she left me. But how was I 
supposed to go without seeing Jake for any length of time? What a mess , I thought again. 

"I'll miss you," Jacob whispered, echoing my thoughts. "Every minute. I hope she leaves 
soon." 

"It really doesn't have to be that way, Jake." 

He sighed. "Yes, it really does. Bella. You... love her. So I'd better not get anywhere near 
her. I'm not sure that I'm even-tempered enough to handle that. Sam would be mad if I broke 
the treaty, and"-his voice turned sarcastic-"you probably wouldn't l ik e it too much if I killed 
your friend." 

I recoiled from him when he said that, but he only tightened his arms, refusing to let me 
escape. "There's no point in avoiding the truth. That's the way things are. Bells." 

"I do not like the way things are." 

Jacob freed one arm so that he could cup his big brown hand under my chin and make me 
look at him. "Yeah. It was easier when we were both human, wasn't it?" 

I sighed. 

We stared at each other for a long moment. His hand smoldered against my skin. In my face, 
I knew there was nothing but wistful sadness-I didn't want to have to say goodbye now, no 
matter for how short a time. At first his face reflected mine, but then, as neither of us looked 
away, his expression changed. 

He released me, lifting his other hand to brush his fingertips along my cheek, trailing them 
down to my jaw. I could feel his fingers tremble-not with anger this time. He pressed his 
palm against my cheek, so that my face was trapped between his burning hands. 

"Bella," he whispered. 

I was frozen. 

No! I hadn't made this decision yet. I didn't know if I could do this, and now I was out of 
time to think. But I would have been a fool if I thought rejecting him now would have no 
consequences. 




I stared back at him. He was not my Jacob, but he could be. His face was familiar and 
beloved. In so many real ways, I did love him. He was my comfort, my safe harbor. Right 
now, I could choose to have him belong to me. 

Alice was back for the moment, but that changed nothing. True love was forever lost. The 
prince was never coming back to kiss me awake from my enchanted sleep. I was not a 
princess, after all. So what was the fairy-tale protocol for other kisses? The mundane kind 
that didn't break any spells? 

Maybe it would be easy-like holding his hand or having his arms around me. Maybe it would 
feel nice. Maybe it wouldn't feel like a betrayal. Besides, who was I betraying, anyway? Just 
myself. 

Keeping his eyes on mine, Jacob began to bend his face toward me. And I was still absolutely 
undecided. 

The shrill ring of the phone made us both jump, but it did not break his focus. He took his 
hand from under my chin and reached over me to grab the receiver, but still held my face 
securely with the hand against my cheek. His dark eyes did not free mine. I was too muddled 
to react, even to take advantage of the distraction. 

"Swan residence," Jacob said, his husky voice low and intense. 

Someone answered, and Jacob altered in an instant. He straightened up, and his hand 
dropped from my face. His eyes went flat, his face blank, and I would have bet the measly 
remainder of my college f and that it was Alice. 

I recovered myself and held out my hand for the phone. Jacob ignored me. 

"He's not here," Jacob said, and the words were menacing. 

There was some very short reply, a request for more information it seemed, because he added 
unwillingly, "He's at the funeral." 

Then Jacob hung up the phone. "Filthy bloodsucker," he muttered under his breath. The face 
he turned back to me was the bitter mask again. 

"Who did you just hang up on?" I gasped, infuriated. "In my house, and on my phone?" 

"Easy! He hung up on me!" 

"He? Who was it?!" 

He sneered the title. "Dr. Carlisle Cullen." 



'Why didn't you let me talk to h im ?! 




"He didn't ask for you," Jacob said coldly. His face was smooth, expressionless, but his hands 
shook. "He asked where Charlie was and I told him. I don't think I broke any rules of 
etiquette." 

"You listen to me, Jacob Black-" 

But he obviously wasn't listening. He looked quickly over his shoulder, as if someone had 
called his name from the other room. His eyes went wide and his body stiff, then he started 
trembling. I listened too, automatically, but heard nothing. 

"Bye, Bells," he spit out, and wheeled toward the front door. 

I ran after him. "What is it?" 

And then I ran into him, as he rocked back on his heels, cussing under his breath. He spun 
around again, knocking me sideways. I hobbled and fell to the floor, my legs tangled with 
his. 

"Shoot, ow!" I protested as he hurriedly jerked his legs free one at a time. 

I struggled to pull myself up as he darted for the back door; he suddenly froze again. 

Alice stood motionless at the foot of the stairs. 

"Bella," she choked. 

I scrambled to my feet and lurched to her side. Her eyes were dazed and far away, her face 
drawn and whiter than bone. Her slim body trembled to an inner turmoil. 

"Alice, what's wrong?" I cried. I put my hands on her face, trying to calm her. 

Her eyes focused on mine abruptly, wide with pain. 

"Edward," was all she whispered. 

My body reacted faster than my mind was able to catch up with the implications of her reply. 
I didn't at first understand why the room was spinning or where the hollow roar in my ears 
was coming from. My mind labored, unable to make sense of Alice's bleak face and how it 
could possibly relate to Edward, while my body was already swaying, seeking the relief of 
unconsciousness before the reality could hit me. 

The stairway tilted at the oddest angle. 

Jacob's furious voice was suddenly in my ear, hissing out a stream of profanities. I felt a 
vague disapproval. His new friends were clearly a bad influence. 



I was on the couch without understanding how I got there, and Jacob was still swearing. It 
felt l ik e there was an earthquake-the couch was shaking under me. 




"What did you do to her?" he demanded. 

Alice ignored him. "Bella? Bella, snap out of it. We have to hurry." 

"Stay back," Jacob warned. 

"Calm down, Jacob Black," Alice ordered. "You don't want to do that so close to her." 

"I don't think I'll have any problem keeping my focus," he retorted, but his voice sounded a 
little cooler. 

"Alice?" My voice was weak. "What happened?" I asked, even though I didn't want to hear. 

"I don't know," she suddenly wailed. "What is he thinking?!" 

I labored to pull myself up despite the dizziness. I realized it was Jacob's arm I was gripping 
for balance. He was the one shaking, not the couch. 

Alice was pulling a small silver phone from her bag when my eyes relocated her. Her fingers 
dialed the numbers so fast they were a blur. 

"Rose, I need to talk to Carlisle now." Her voice whipped through the words. "Fine, as soon 
as he's back. No, I'll be on a plane. Look, have you heard anything from Edward?" 

Alice paused now, listening with an expression that grew more appalled every second. Her 
mouth opened into a little O of horror, and the phone shook in her hand. 

"Why?" she gasped. "Why would you do that, Rosalie?" 

Whatever the answer was, it made her jaw tighten in anger. Her eyes flashed and narrowed. 

"Well, you're wrong on both counts, though, Rosalie, so that would be a problem, don't you 
think?" she asked acidly. "Yes, that's right. She's absolutely fine-I was wrong... It's a long 
story... But you're wrong about that part, too, that's why I'm calling... Yes, that's exactly 
what I saw." 

Alice's voice was very hard and her lips were pulled back from her teeth. "It's a bit late for 
that, Rose. Save your remorse for someone who believes it." Alice snapped the phone shut 
with a sharp twist of her fingers. 

Her eyes were tortured as she turned to face me. 

"Alice," I blurted out quickly. I couldn't let her speak yet. I needed a few more seconds before 
she spoke and her words destroyed what was left of my life. "Alice, Carlisle is back, though. 
He called just before. . . " 



She stared at me blankly. "How long ago?" she asked in a hollow voice. 




"Half a minute before you showed up." 

"What did he say?" She really focused now, waiting for my answer. 

"I didn't talk to him." My eyes flickered to Jacob. 

Alice turned her penetrating gaze on him. He flinched, but held his place next to me. He sit 
awkwardly, almost as if he were trying to shield me with his body. 

"He asked for Charlie, and I told him Charlie wasn't here," Jacob muttered resentfully. 

"Is that everything?" Alice demanded, her voice l ik e ice. 

"Then he hung up on me," Jacob spit back. A tremor rolled down his spine, shaking me with 
it. 

"You told him Charlie was at the funeral," I reminded him. 

Alice jerked her head back toward me "What were his exact words?" 

"He said, 'He's not here,' and when Carlisle asked where Charlie was, Jacob said, 'At the 
funeral.'" 

Alice moaned and sank to her knees. 

"Tell me Alice," I whispered. 

"That wasn't Carlisle on the phone," she said hopelessly. 

"Are you calling me a liar?" Jacob snarled from beside me. 

Alice ignored him, focusing on my bewildered face. 

"It was Edward." The words were just a choked whisper. "He thinks you're dead." 

My mind started to work again. These words weren't the ones I'd been afraid of, and the 
relief cleared my head. 

"Rosalie told him I killed myself, didn't she?" I said, sighing as I relaxed. 

"Yes," Alice admitted, her eyes flashing hard again. 

"In her defense, she did believe it. They rely on my sight far too much for something that 
works so imperfectly. But for her to track him down to tell him this! Didn't she realize... or 
care. . . ?" Her voice faded away in horror. 

"And when Edward called here, he thought Jacob meant my funeral," I realized. It stung to 
know how close I'd been, just inches away from his voice. My nails dug into Jacob's arm, but 




he didn't flinch. 



Alice looked at me strangely. "You're not upset," she whispered. 

"Well, it's really rotten timing, but it will all get straightened out. The next time he calls, 
someone will tell him... what... really..." I trailed off. Her gaze strangled the words in my 
throat. 

Why was she so panicked? Why was her face twisting now with pity and horror? What was 
it she had said to Rosalie on the phone just now? Something about what she'd seen... and 
Rosalie's remorse; Rosalie would never feel remorse for anything that happened to me. But if 
she'd hurt her family, hurt her brother. . . 

"Bella," Alice whispered. "Edward won't call again. He believed her." 

"I. Don't. Understand." My mouth framed each word in silence. I couldn't push the air out to 
actually say the words that would make her explain what that meant. 

"He's going to Italy." 

It took the length of one heartbeat for me to comprehend. 

When Edward's voice came back to me now, it was not the perfect imitation of my 
delusions. It was just the weak, flat tone of my memories. But the words alone were enough 
to shred through my chest and leave it gaping open. Words from a time when I would have 
bet everything that I owned or could borrow on that fact that he loved me. 

Well, I wasn 7 going to live without you , he'd said as we watched Romeo and Juliet die, here 
in this very room. But / wasn 't sure how to do it. . . I knew Emmett and Jasper would never 
help. .. so I was thinking maybe 1 would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi. . . 
You don 7 irritate them. Not unless you want to die. 

Not unless you want to die. 

"NO!" The half-shrieked denial was so loud after the whispered words, it made us all jump. I 
felt the blood rushing to my face as I realized what she'd seen. "No! No, no, no! He can't! He 
can't do that!" 

"He made up his mind as soon as your friend confirmed that it was too late to save you." 

"But he... he left] He didn't want me anymore! What difference does it make now? He knew 
I would die sometime!" 

"I don't think he ever planned to outlive you by long," Alice said quietly. 

"How dare he!" I screamed. I was on my feet now, and Jacob rose uncertainly to put himself 
between Alice and me again. 




"Oh, get out of the way, Jacob!" I elbowed my way around his trembling body with desperate 
impatience. "What do we do?" I begged Alice. There had to be something. "Can't we call 
him? Can Carlisle?" 

She was shaking her head. "That was the first thing I tried. He left his phone in a trash can in 
Rio-someone answered it. . . " she whispered. 

"You said before we had to hurry. Hurry how? Let's do it, whatever it is!" 

"Bella, I-I don't think I can ask you to. . . " She trailed off in indecision. 

"Ask me!" I commanded. 

She put her hands on my shoulders, holding me in place, her fingers flexing sporadically to 
emphasize her words. "We may already be too late. I saw him going to the Volturi... and 
asking to die." We both cringed, and my eyes were suddenly blind. I blinked feverishly at the 
tears. "It all depends on what they choose. I can't see that till they make a decision. 

"But if they say no, and they might-Aro is fond of Carlisle, and wouldn't want to offend 
him-Edward has a backup plan. They're very protective of their city. If Edward does 
something to upset the peace, he thinks they'll act to stop him. And he's right. They will." 

I stared at her with my jaw clenched in frustration. I'd heard nothing yet that would explain 
why we were still standing here. 

"So if they agree to grant his favor, we're too late. If they say no, and he comes up with a 
plan to offend them quickly enough, we're too late. If he gives into his more theatrical 
tendencies. . . we might have time." 

"Let's go!" 

"Listen, Bella! Whether we are in time or not, we will be in the heart of the Volturi city. I 
will be considered his accomplice if he is successful. You will be a human who not only 
knows too much, but also smells too good. There's a very good chance that they will 
eliminate us all-though in your case it won't be punishment so much as dinnertime." 

"This is what's keeping us here?" I asked in disbelief. "I'll go alone if you're afraid." I mentally 
tabulated what money was left in my account, and wondered if Alice would lend me the rest. 

"I'm only afraid of getting you killed." 

I snorted in disgust. "I almost get myself killed on a daily basis! Tell me what I need to do!" 
"You write a note to Charlie. I'll call the airlines." 



'Charlie," I gasped. 




Not that my presence was protecting him, but could I leave him here alone to face. . . 



"I'm not going to let anything happen to Charlie." Jacob's low voice was gruff and angry. 
"Screw the treaty." 

I glanced up at him, and he scowled at my panicked expression. 

"Hurry, Bella," Alice interrupted urgently. 

I ran to the kitchen, yanking the drawers open and throwing the contents all over the floor as 
I searched for a pen. A smooth, brown hand held one out to me. 

"Thanks," I mumbled, pulling the cap off with my teeth. He silently handed me the pad of 
paper we wrote phone messages on. I tore off the top sheet and threw it over my shoulder. 

Dad , I wrote. I'm with Alice. Edward's in trouble. You can ground me when 1 get back. 1 
know it's a bad time. So sorry. Love you so much. Bella. 

"Don't go," Jacob whispered. The anger was all gone now that Alice was out of sight. 

I wasn't about to waste time arguing with him. "Please, please, please take care of Charlie," I 
said as I dashed back out to the front room. Alice was waiting in the doorway with a bag 
over her shoulder. 

"Get your wallet-you'll need ID. Please tell me you have a passport. I don't have time to 
forge one." 

I nodded and then raced up the stairs, my knees weak with gratitude that my mother had 
wanted to marry Phil on a beach in Mexico. Of course, l ik e all her plans, it had fallen 
through. But not before I'd made all the practical arrangements I could for her. 

I tore through my room. I stuffed my old wallet, a clean T-shirt, and sweatpants into my 
backpack, and then threw my toothbrush on top. I hurled myself back down the stairs. The 
sense of deja vu was nearly stifling by this point. At least, unlike the last time-when I'd run 
away from Forks to escape thirsty vampires rather than to find them-I wouldn't have to say 
goodbye to Charlie in person. 

Jacob and Alice were locked in some kind of confrontation in front of the open door, 
standing so far apart you wouldn't assume at first that they were having a conversation. 
Neither one seemed to notice my noisy reappearance. 

"You might control yourself on occasion, but these leeches you're taking her to-" Jacob was 
furiously accusing her. 

"Yes. You're right, dog." Alice was snarling, too. "The Volturi are the very essence of our 
kind-they're the reason your hair stands on end when you smell me. They are the substance 
of your nightmares, the dread behind your instincts. I'm not unaware of that." 




"And you take her to them like a bottle of wine for a party!" he shouted. 

"You think she'd be better off if I left her here alone, with Victoria stalking her?" 

"We can handle the redhead." 

"Then why is she still hunting?" 

Jacob growled, and a shudder rippled through his torso. 

"Stop that!" I shouted at them both, wild with impatience. "Argue when we get back, let's 
go!" 

Alice turned for the car, disappearing in her haste. I hurried after her, pausing automatically 
to turn and lock the door. 

Jacob caught my arm with a shivering hand. "Please, Bella. I'm begging." 

His dark eyes were glistening with tears. A lump filled my throat. 

"Jake, I have to-" 

"You don't, though. You really don't. You could stay here with me. You could stay alive. For 
Charlie. For me." 

The engine of Carlisle's Mercedes purred; the rhythm of the thrumming spiked when Alice 
revved it impatiently. 

I shook my head, tears spattering from my eyes with the sharp motion. I pulled my arm free, 
and he didn't fight me. 

"Don't die, Bella," he choked out. "Don't go. Don't." 

What if I never saw him again? 

The thought pushed me past the silent tears; a sob broke out from my chest. I threw my arms 
around his waist and hugged for one too-short moment, burying my tear- wet face against his 
chest. He put his big hand on the back of my hair, as if to hold me there. 

"Bye, Jake." I pulled his hand from my hair, and kissed his palm. I couldn't bear to look at his 
face. "Sorry," I whispered. 

Then I spun and raced for the car. The door on the passenger side was open and waiting. I 
threw my backpack over the headrest and slid in, slamming the door behind me. 

"Take care of Charlie!" I turned to shout out the window, but Jacob was nowhere in sight. 
As Alice stomped on the gas and-with the tires screeching l ik e human screams-spun us 
around to face the road, I caught sight of a shred of white near the edge of the trees. A piece 




of a shoe. 




19. HATE 



WE MADE OUR FLIGHT WITH SECONDS TO SPARE, AND THEN the true torture 
began. The plane sat idle on the tarmac while the flight attendants strolled-so casually-up 
and down the aisle, patting the bags in the overhead compartments to make sure everything 
fit. The pilots leaned out of the cockpit, chatting with them as they passed. Alice's hand was 
hard on my shoulder, holding me in my seat while I bounced anxiously up and down. 

"It's faster than running," she reminded me in a low voice. 

I just nodded in time with my bouncing. 

At last the plane rolled lazily from the gate, building speed with a gradual steadiness that 
tortured me further. I expected some kind of relief when we achieved liftoff, but my frenzied 
impatience didn't lessen. 

Alice lifted the phone on the back of the seat in front of her before we'd stopped climbing, 
turning her back on the stewardess who eyed her with disapproval. Something about my 
expression stopped the stewardess from coming over to protest. 

I tried to tune out what Alice was murmuring to Jasper; I didn't want to hear the words 
again, but some slipped through. 

"I can't be sure, I keep seeing him do different things, he keeps changing his mind. . . A killing 
spree through the city, attacking the guard, lifting a car over his head in the main square... 
mostly things that would expose them-he knows that's the fastest way to force a reaction. . . " 

"No, you can't." Alice's voice dropped till it was nearly inaudible, though I was sitting inches 
from her. Contrarily, I listened harder. "Tell Emmett no. . . Well, go after Emmett and Rosalie 
and bring them back. . . Think about it, Jasper. If he sees any of us, what do you think he will 
do?" 

She nodded. "Exactly. I think Bella is the only chance-if there is a chance... I'll do 
everything that can be done, but prepare Carlisle; the odds aren't good." 

She laughed then, and there was a catch in her voice. "I've thought of that. . . Yes, I promise." 
Her voice became pleading. "Don't follow me. I promise, Jasper. One way or another, I'll get 
out. . . And I love you." 

She hung up, and leaned back in her seat with her eyes closed. "I hate lying to him." 

"Tell me everything, Alice," I begged. "I don't understand. Why did you tell Jasper to stop 
Emmett, why can't they come help us?" 

"Two reasons," she whispered, her eyes still closed. "The first I told him. We could try to 
stop Edward ourselves-if Emmett could get his hands on him, we might be able to stop him 




long enough to convince him you're alive. But we can't sneak up on Edward. And if he sees 
us coming for him, he'll just act that much faster. He'll throw a Buiclc through a wall or 
something, and the Volturi will take him down. 

"That's the second reason of course, the reason I couldn't say to Jasper. Because if they're 
there and the Volturi kill Edward, they'll fight them. Bella." She opened her eyes and stared 
at me, beseeching. "If there were any chance we could win... if there were a way that the 
four of us could save my brother by fighting for him, maybe it would be different. But we 
can't, and, Bella, I can't lose Jasper like that." 

I realized why her eyes begged for my understanding. She was protecting Jasper, at our 
expense, and maybe at Edward's, too. I understood, and I did not think badly of her. I 
nodded. 

"Couldn't Edward hear you, though.'" I asked. "Wouldn't he know, as soon as he heard your 
thoughts, that I was alive, that there was no point to this?" 

Not that there was any justification, either way. I still couldn't believe that he was capable of 
reacting l ik e this. It made no sense! I remembered with painful clarity his words that day on 
the sofa, while we watched Romeo and Juliet kill themselves, one after the other. I wasn't 
going to live without you, he'd said, as if it should be such an obvious conclusion. But the 
words he had spoken in the forest as he'd left me had canceled all that out-forcefully. 

"If he were listening," she explained. "But believe it or not, it's possible to lie with your 
thoughts. If you had died, I would still try to stop him. And I would be thinking 'she's alive, 
she's alive' as hard as I could. He knows that." 

I ground my teeth in mute frustration. 

"If there were any way to do this without you, Bella, I wouldn't be endangering you like this. 
It's very wrong of me." 

"Don't be stupid. I'm the last thing you should be worrying about." I shook my head 
impatiently. "Tell me what you meant, about hating to lie to Jasper." 

She smiled a grim smile. "I promised him I would get out before they killed me, too. It's not 
something I can guarantee-not by a long shot." She raised her eyebrows, as if willing me to 
take the danger more seriously. 

"Who are these Volturi?" I demanded in a whisper. "What makes them so much more 
dangerous than Emmett, Jasper, Rosalie, and you?" It was hard to imagine something scarier 
than that. 

She took a deep breath, and then abruptly leveled a dark glance over my shoulder. I turned in 
time to see the man in the aisle seat looking away as if he wasn't listening to us. He appeared 
to be a businessman, in a dark suit with a power tie and a laptop on his knees. While I stared 




at him with irritation, he opened the computer and very conspicuously put headphones on. 

I leaned closer to Alice. Her lips were at my ears as she breathed the story. 

"I was surprised that you recognized the name," she said. "That you understood so 
immediately what it meant-when I said he was going to Italy. I thought I would have to 
explain. How much did Edward tell you?" 

"He just said they were an old, powerful family-like royalty. That you didn't antagonize them 
unless you wanted to. . . die," I whispered. The last word was hard to choke out. 

"You have to understand," she said, her voice slower, more measured now. "We Cullens are 
unique in more ways than you know. It's... abnormal for so many of us to live together in 
peace. It's the same for Tanya's family in the north, and Carlisle speculates that abstaining 
makes it easier for us to be civilized, to form bonds based on love rather than survival or 
convenience. Even James's little coven of three was unusually large-and you saw how easily 
Laurent left them. Our kind travel alone, or in pairs, as a general rule. Carlisle's family is the 
biggest in existence, as far as I know, with the one exception. The Volturi. 

"There were three of them originally, Aro, Caius, and Marcus." 

"I've seen them," I mumbled. "In the picture in Carlisle's study." 

Alice nodded. "Two females joined them over time, and the five of them make up the family. 
I'm not sure, but I suspect that their age is what gives them the ability to live peacefully 
together. They are well over three thousand years old. Or maybe it's their gifts that give them 
extra tolerance. Like Edward and I, Aro and Marcus are. . . talented." 

She continued before I could ask. "Or maybe it's just their love of power that binds them 
together. Royalty is an apt description." 

"But if there are only five-" 

"Five that make up the family," she corrected. "That doesn't include their guard." 

I took a deep breath. "That sounds. . . serious." 

"Oh, it is," she assured me. "There were nine members of the guard that were permanent, the 
last time we heard. Others are more... transitory. It changes. And many of them are gifted as 
well-with formidable gifts, gifts that make what I can do look l ik e a parlor trick. The Volturi 
chose them for their abilities, physical or otherwise." 

I opened my mouth, and then closed it. I didn't think I wanted to know how bad the odds 
were. 



She nodded again, as if she understood exactly what I was thinking. "They don't get into too 
many confrontations. No one is stupid enough to mess with them. They stay in their city, 




leaving only as duty calls." 

"Duty?" I wondered. 

"Didn't Edward tell you what they do?" 

"No," I said, feeling the blank expression on my face. 

Alice looked over my head again, toward the businessman, and put her wintry lips back to 
my ear. 

"There's a reason he called them royalty... the ruling class. Over the millennia, they have 
assumed the position of enforcing our rules-which actually translates to punishing 
transgressors. They fulfill that duty decisively." 

My eyes popped wide with shock. "There are rules?' I asked in a voice that was too loud. 
"Shh!" 

"Shouldn't somebody have mentioned this to me earlier?" I whispered angrily. "I mean, I 
wanted to be a. . . to be one of you! Shouldn't somebody have explained the rules to me?" 

Alice chuckled once at my reaction. "It's not that complicated, Bella. There's only one core 
restriction-and if you think about it, you can probably figure it out for yourself." 

I thought about it. "Nope, I have no idea." 

She shook her head, disappointed. "Maybe it's too obvious. We just have to keep our 
existence a secret." 

"Oh," I mumbled. It was obvious. 

"It makes sense, and most of us don't need policing," she continued. "But, after a few 
centuries, sometimes one of us gets bored. Or crazy. I dor't know. And then the Volturi step 
in before it can compromise them, or the rest of us." 

"So Edward..." 

"Is planning to flout that in their own city-the city they've secretly held for three thousand 
years, since the time of the Etruscans. They are so protective of their city that they don't 
allow hunting within its walls. Volterra is probably the safest city in the world-from vampire 
attack at the very least." 

"But you said they didn't leave. How do they eat?" 

"They don't leave. They bring in their food from the outside, from quite far away sometimes. 
It gives their guard something to do when they're not out annihilating mavericks. Or 
protecting Volterra from exposure. . . " 




"From situations like this one, l ik e Edward," I finished her sentence. It was amazingly easy to 
say his name now. I wasn't sure what the difference was. Maybe because I wasn't really 
planning on living much longer without seeing him. Or at all, if we were too late. It was 
comforting to know that I would have an easy out. 

"I doubt they've ever had a situation quite like this," she muttered, disgusted. "You don't get 
a lot of suicidal vampires." 

The sound that escaped out of my mouth was very quiet, but Alice seemed to understand 
that it was a cry of pain. She wrapped her thin, strong arm around my shoulders. 

"We'll do what we can, Bella. It's not over yet." 

"Not yet." I let her comfort me, though I knew she thought our chances were poor. "And the 
Volturi will get us if we mess up." 

Alice stiffened. "You say that like it's a good thing." 

I shrugged. 

"Knock it off, Bella, or we're turning around in New York and going back to Forks." 

"What?" 

"You know what. If we're too late for Edward, I'm going to do my damnedest to get you 
back to Charlie, and I don't want any trouble from you. Do you understand that?" 

"Sure, Alice." 

She pulled back slightly so that she could glare at me. "No trouble." 

"Scout's honor," I muttered. 

She rolled her eyes. 

"Let me concentrate, now. I'm trying to see what he's planning." 

She left her arm around me, but let her head fall back against the seat and closed her eyes. 
She pressed her free hand to the side of her face, rubbing her fingertips against her temple. 

I watched her in fascination for a long time. Eventually, she became utterly motionless, hei 
face l ik e a stone sculpture. The minutes passed, and if I didn't know better, I would have 
thought she'd fallen asleep. I didn't dare interrupt her to ask what was going on. 

I wished there was something safe for me to think about. I couldn't allow myself to consider 
the horrors we were headed toward, or, more horrific yet, the chance that we might fail-not 
if I wanted to keep from screaming aloud. 




I couldn't anticipate anything, either. Maybe, if I were very, very, very lucky, I would 
somehow be able to save Edward. But I wasn't so stupid as to think that saving him would 
mean that I could stay with him. I was no different, no more special than I'd been before. 
There would be no new reason for him to want me now. Seeing h im and losing him again. . . 

I fought back against the pain. This was the price I had to pay to save his life. I would pay it. 

They showed a movie, and my neighbor got headphones. Sometimes I watched the figures 
moving across the little screen, but I couldn't even tell if the movie was supposed to be a 
romance or a horror film . 

After an eternity, the plane began to descend toward New York City. Alice remained in her 
trance. I dithered, reaching out to touch her, only to pull my hand back again. This happened 
a dozen times before the plane touched town with a jarring impact. 

"Alice," I finally said. "Alice, we have to go." 

I touched her arm. 

Her eyes came open very slowly. She shook her head from side to side for a moment. 

"Anything new?" I asked in a low voice, conscious of the man listening on the other side of 
me. 



"Not exactly," she breathed in a voice I could barely catch. "He's getting closer. He's 
deciding how he's going to ask." 

We had to run for our connection, but that was good-better than having to wait. As soon as 
the plane was in the air, Alice closed her eyes and slid back into the same stupor as before. I 
waited as patiently as I could. When it was dark again, I opened the window to stare out into 
the flat black that was no better than the window shade. 

I was grateful that I'd had so many months' practice with controlling my thoughts. Instead of 
dwelling on the terrifying possibilities that, no matter what Alice said, I did not intend to 
survive, I concentrated on lesser problems. Like, what I was going to say to Charlie if I got 
back:' That was a thorny enough problem to occupy several hours. And Jacob? He'd 
promised to wait for me, but did that promise still apply? Would I end up home alone in 
Forks, with no one at all? Maybe I didn't want to survive, no matter what happened. 

It felt like seconds later when Alice shook my shoulder-I hadn't realized I'd fallen asleep. 

"Bella," she hissed, her voice a little too loud in the darkened cabin full of sleeping humans. 

I wasn't disoriented-I hadn't been out long enough for that. 

"What's wrong?" 




Alice's eyes gleamed in the dim light of a reading lamp in the row behind us. 

"It's not wrong." She smiled fiercely. "It's right. They're deliberating, but they've decided to 
tell him no." 

"The Volturi?" I muttered, groggy. 

"Of course, Bella, keep up. I can see what they're going to say." 

"Tell me." 

An attendant tiptoed down the aisle to us. "Can I get you ladies a pillow?" His hushed 
whisper was a rebuke to our comparatively loud conversation. 

"No, thank you." Alice beamed at up at him, her smile shockingly lovely. The attendant's 
expression was dazed as he turned and stumbled his way back. 

"Tell me," I breathed almost silently. 

She whispered into my ear. "They're interested in him-they think his talent could be uselul. 
They're going to offer him a place with them." 

"What will he say?" 

"I can't see that yet, but I'll bet it's colorful." She grinned again. "This is the first good 
news-the first break. They're intrigued; they truly don't want to destroy him-'wasteful,' that's 
the word Aro will use-and that may be enough to force him to get creative. The longer he 
spends on his plans, the better for us." 

It wasn't enough to make me hopeful, to make me feel the relief she obviously felt. There 
were still so many ways that we could be too late. And if I didn't get through the walls into 
the Volturi city, I wouldn't be able to stop Alice from dragging me back home. 

"Alice?" 

"What?" 

"I'm confused. How are you seeing this so clearly? And then other times, you see things far 
away-things that don't happen?" 

Her eyes tightened. I wondered if she guessed what I was thinking of. 

"It's clear because it's immediate and close, and I'm really concentrating. The faraway things 
that come on their own-those are just glimpses, faint maybes. Plus, I see my kind more easily 
than yours. Edward is even easier because I'm so attuned to him." 



You see me sometimes," I reminded her. 




She shook her head. "Not as clearly. 



I sighed. "I really wish you could have been right about me. In the beginning, when you first 
saw things about me, before we even met. 

"What do you mean?" 

"You saw me become one of you." I barely mouthed the words. 

She sighed. "It was a possibility at the time." 

"At the time," I repeated. 

"Actually, Bella..." She hesitated, and then seemed to make a choice. "Honestly, I think it's 
all gotten beyond ridiculous. I'm debating whether to just change you myself." 

I stared at her, frozen with shock. Instantly, my mind resisted her words. I couldn't afford 
that kind of hope if she changed her mind. 

"Did I scare you?" she wondered. "I thought that's what you wanted." 

"I do!" I gasped. "Oh, Alice, do it now! I could help you so much-and I wouldn't slow you 
down. Bite me!" 

"Shh," she cautioned. The attendant was looking in our direction again. "Try to be 
reasonable," she whispered. "We don't have enough time. We have to get into Volterra 
tomorrow. You'd be writhing in pain for days." She made a face. "And I don't think the other 
passengers would react well." 

I bit my lip. "If you don't do it now, you'll change your mind." 

"No." She frowned, her expression unhappy. "I don't think I will. He'll be furious, but what 
will he be able to do about it?" 

My heart beat faster. "Nothing at all." 

She laughed quietly, and then sighed. "You have too much faith in me, Bella. I'm not sure 
that I can. I'll probably just end up killing you." 

"I'll take my chances." 

"You are so bizarre, even for a human." 

"Thanks." 

"Oh well, this is purely hypothetical at this point, anyway. First we have to live through 
tomorrow." 




"Good point." But at least I had something to hope for if we did. If Alice made good on her 
promise-and if she didn't kill me-then Edward could run after his distractions all he wanted, 
and I could follow. I wouldn't let him be distracted. Maybe, when I was beautiful and strong, 
he wouldn't want distractions. 

"Go back to sleep," she encouraged me. "I'll wake you up when there's something new." 

"Right," I grumbled, certain that sleep was a lost cause now. Alice pulled her legs up on the 
seat, wrapping her arms around them and leaning her forehead against her knees. She rocked 
back and forth as she concentrated. 

I rested my head against the seat, watching her, and the next thing I knew, she was snapping 
the shade closed against the faint brightening in the eastern sky. 

"What's happening?" I mumbled. 

"They've told h im no," she said quietly. I noticed at once that her enthusiasm was gone. 

My voice choked in my throat with panic. "What's he going to do?" 

"It was chaotic at first. I was only getting flickers, he was changing plans so quickly." 

"What kinds of plans?" I pressed. 

"There was a bad hour," she whispered. "He'd decided to go hunting." 

She looked at me, seeing the comprehension in my face. 

"In the city," she explained. "It got very close. He changed his mind at the last minute." 

"He wouldn't want to disappoint Carlisle," I mumbled. Not at the end. 

"Probably," she agreed. 

"Will there be enough time?" As I spoke, there was a shift in the cabin pressure. I could feel 
the plane angling downward. 

"I'm hoping so-if he sticks to his latest decision, maybe." 

"What is that?" 

"He's going to keep it simple. He's just going to walk out into the sun." 

Just walk out into the sun. That was all. 

It would be enough. The image of Edward in the meadow-glowing, shimmering l ik e his s ki n 
was made of a million diamond facets-was burned into my memory. No human who saw that 
would ever forget. The Volturi couldn't possibly allow it. Not if they wanted to keep their 




city inconspicuous. 



I looked at the slight gray glow that shone through the opened windows. "We'll be too late," 
I whispered, my throat closing in panic. 

She shook her head. "Right now, he's leaning toward the melodramatic. He wants the 
biggest audience possible, so he'll choose the main plaza, under the clock tower. The walls 
are high there. He'll wait till the sun is exactly overhead." 

"So we have till noon?" 

"If we're lucky. If he sticks with this decision." 

The pilot came on over the intercom, announcing, first in French and then in English, our 
imminent landing. The seat belt lights dinged and flashed. 

"How far is it from Florence to Volterra?" 

"That depends on how fast you drive. . . Bella?" 

"Yes?" 

She eyed me speculatively. "How strongly are you opposed to grand theft auto?" 

A bright yellow Porsche screamed to a stop a few feet in front of where I paced, the word 
TURBO scrawled in silver cursive across its back. Everyone beside me on the crowded 
airport sidewalk stared. 

"Hurry, Bella!" Alice shouted impatiently through the open passenger window. 

I ran to the door and threw myself in, feeling as though I might as well be wearing a black 
stocking over my head. 

"Sheesh, Alice," I complained. "Could you pick a more conspicuous car to steal?" 

The interior was black leather, and the windows were tinted dark. It felt safer inside, l ik e 
nighttime. 

Alice was already weaving, too fast, through the thick airport traffic-sliding through tiny 
spaces between the cars as I cringed and fumbled for my seat belt. 

"The important question," she corrected, "is whether I could have stolen a faster car, and I 
don't think so. I got lucky." 

"I'm sure that will be very comforting at the roadblock." 

She trilled a laugh. "Trust me, Bella. If anyone sets up a roadblock, it will be behind us." She 




hit the gas then, as if to prove her point. 

I probably should have watched out the window as first the city of Florence and then the 
Tuscan landscape flashed past with blurring speed. This was my first trip anywhere, and 
maybe my last, too. But Alice's driving frightened me, despite the fact that I knew I could 
trust her behind the wheel. And I was too tortured with anxiety to really see the hills or the 
walled towns that looked l ik e castles in the distance. 

"Do you see anything more?" 

"There's something going on," Alice muttered. "Some kind of festival. The streets are full of 
people and red flags. What's the date today?" 

I wasn't entirely sure. "The nineteenth, maybe?" 

"Well, that's ironic. It's Saint Marcus Day." 

"Which means?" 

She chuckled darkly. "The city holds a celebration every year. As the legend goes, a Christian 
missionary, a Father Marcus-Marcus of the Voltun, in fact-drove all the vampires from 
Volterra fifteen hundred years ago. The story claims he was martyred in Romania, still trying 
to drive away the vampire scourge. Of course that's nonsense-he's never left the city. But 
that's where some of the superstitions about things l ik e crosses and garlic come from. Father 
Marcus used them so successfully. And vampires don't trouble Volterra, so they must work." 
Her smile was sardonic. "It's become more of a celebration of the city, and recognition for the 
police force-after all, Volterra is an amazingly safe city. The police get the credit." 

I was realizing what she meant when she'd said ironic. "They're not going to be very happy if 
Edward messes things up for them on St. Marcus Day, are they?" 

She shook her head, her expression grim. "No. They'll act very quickly." 

I looked away, fighting against my teeth as they tried to break through the skin of my lower 
lip. Bleeding was not the best idea right now. 

The sun was terrifyingly high in the pale blue sky. 

"He's still planning on noon?" I checked. 

"Yes. He's decided to wait. And they're waiting for him." 

"Tell me what I have to do." 

She kept her eyes on the winding road-the needle on the speedometer was touching the far 
right on the dial. 



You don't have to do anything. He just has to see you before he moves into the light. And 




he has to see you before he sees me." 

"How are we going to work that?" 

A small red car seemed to be racing backward as Alice zoomed around it. 

"I'm going to get you as close as possible, and then you're going to run in the direction I point 
you." 

I nodded. 

"Try not to trip," she added. "We don't have time for a concussion today." 

I groaned. That would be just like me-ruin everything, destroy the world, in a moment of 
klutziness. 

The sun continued to climb in the sky while Alice raced against it. It was too brigh:, and that 
had me panicking. Maybe he wouldn't feel the need to wait for noon after all. 

"There," Alice said abruptly, pointing to the castle city atop the closest hill. 

I stared at it, feeling the very first hint of a new kind of fear. Every minute since yesterday 
moming-it seemed l ik e a week ago-when Alice had spoken his name at the foot of the stairs, 
there had been only one fear. And yet, now, as I stared at the ancient sienna walls and towers 
crowning the peak of the steep hill, I felt another, more selfish kind of dread thrill through 
me. 



I supposed the city was very beautiful. It absolutely terrified me. 
"Volterra," Alice announced in a flat, icy voice. 




20. VOLTERRA 

WE BEGAN THE STEEP CLIMB, AND THE ROAD GREW CONGESTED. As we 
wound higher, the cars became too close together for Alice to weave insanely between them 
anymore. We slowed to a crawl behind a little tan Peugeot. 

"Alice," I moaned. The clock on the dash seemed to be speeding up. 

"It's the only way in," she tried soothe me. But her voice was too strained to comfort. 

The cars continued to edge forward, one car length at a time. The sun beamed down 
brilliantly, seeming already overhead. 

The cars crept one by one toward the city. As we got closer, I could see cars parked by the 
side of the road with people getting out to walk the test of the way. At first I thought it was 
just impatience-something I could easily understand. But then we came around a 
switchback, and I could see the filled parking lot outside the city wall, the crowds of people 
walking through the gates. No one was being allowed to drive through. 

"Alice," I whispered urgently. 

"I know," she said. Her face was chiseled from ice. 

Now that I was looking, and we were crawling slowly enough to see, I could tell that it was 
very windy. The people crowding toward the gate gripped their hats and tugged their hair 
out of their faces. Their clothes billowed around them. I also noticed that the color red was 
everywhere. Red shirts, red hats, red flags dripping l ik e long ribbons beside the gate, 
whipping in the wind-as I watched, the brilliant crimson scarf one woman had tied around 
her hair was caught in a sudden gust. It twisted up into the air above her, writhing like it was 
alive. She reached for it, jumping in the air, but it continued to flutter higher, a patch of 
bloody color against the dull, ancient walls. 

"Bella." Alice spoke quickly in a fierce, low voice. "I can't see what the guard here will 
decide now-if this doesn't work, you're going to have to go in alone. You're going to have to 
run. Just keep asking for the Palazzo dei Priori, and running in the direction they tell you. 
Don't get lost." 

"Palazzo dei Priori, Palazzo dei Priori," I repeated the name over and over again, trying to get 
it down. 

"Or 'the clock tower,' if they speak English. I'll go around and try to find a secluded spot 
somewhere behind the city where I can go over the wall." 

I nodded. "Palazzo dei Priori." 



Edward will be under the clock tower, to the north of the square. There's a narrow alleyway 




on the right, and he'll be in the shadow there. You have to get his attention before he can 
move into the sun." 



I nodded furiously. 

Alice was near the front of the line. A man in a navy blue uniform was directing the flow of 
traffic, turning the cars away from the full lot. They U-tumed and headed back to find a place 
beside the road. Then it was Alice's turn. 

The uniformed man motioned lazily, not paying attention. Alice accelerated, edging around 
him and heading for the gate. He shouted something at us, but held his ground, waving 
frantically to keep the next car from following our bad example. 

The man at the gate wore a matching uniform. As we approached him, the throngs of tourists 
passed, crowding the sidewalks, staring curiously at the pushy, flashy Porsche. 

The guard stepped into the middle of the street. Alice angled the car carefully before she 
came to a full stop. The sun beat against my window, and she was in shadow. She swiftly 
reached behind the seat and grabbed something from her bag. 

The guard came around the car with an irritated expression, and tapped on her window 
angrily. 

She rolled the window down halfway, and I watched him do a double take when he saw the 
face behind the dark glass. 

"I'm sorry, only tour buses allowed in the city today, miss," he said in English, with a heavy 
accent. He was apologetic, now, as if he wished he had better news for the strikingly 
beautiful woman. 

"It's a private tour," Alice said, flashing an alluring smile. She reached her hand out cf the 
window, into the sunlight. I froze, until I realized she was wearing an elbow-length, tan 
glove. She took his hand, still raised from tapping her window, and pulled it into the car. She 
put something into his palm, and folded his fingers around it. 

His face was dazed as he retrieved his hand and stared at the thick roll of money he now 
held. The outside bill was a thousand dollar bill. 

"Is this a joke?" he mumbled. 

Alice's smile was blinding. "Only if you think it's funny." 

He looked at her, his eyes staring wide. I glanced nervously at the clock on the dash. If 
Edward stuck to his plan, we had only five minutes left. 

"I'm in a wee bit of a hurry," she hinted, still smiling. 




The guard blinked twice, and then shoved the money inside his vest. He took a step away 
from the window and waved us on. None of the passing people seemed to notice the quiet 
exchange. Alice drove into the city, and we both sighed in relief. 

The street was very narrow, cobbled with the same color stones as the faded cinnamon 
brown buildings that darkened the street with their shade. It had the feel of an alleyway. Red 
flags decorated the walls, spaced only a few yards apart, flapping in the wind that whistled 
through the narrow lane. 

It was crowded, and the foot traffic slowed our progress. 

"Just a little farther," Alice encouraged me; I was gripping the door handle, ready to throw 
myself into the street as soon as she spoke the word. 

She drove in quick spurts and sudden stops, and the people in the crowd shook their fists at 
us and said angry words that I was glad I couldn't understand. She turned onto a little path 
that couldn't have been meant for cars; shocked people had to squeeze into doorways as we 
scraped by. We found another street at the end. The buildings were taller here; they leaned 
together overhead so that no sunlight touched the pavement-the thrashing red flags on either 
side nearly met. The crowd was thicker here than anywhere else. Alice stopped the car. I had 
the door open before we were at a standstill. 

She pointed to where the street widened into a patch of bright openness. "There-we're at the 
southern end of the square. Run straight across, to the right of the clock tower. I'll find a way 
around-" 

Her breath caught suddenly, and when she spoke again, her voice was a hiss. "They're 
everywhere ?" 

I froze in place, but she pushed me out of the car. "Forget about them. You have two 
minutes. Go, Bella, go!" she shouted, climbing out of the car as she spoke. 

I didn't pause to watch Alice melt into the shadows. I didn't stop to close my door behind 
me. I shoved a heavy woman out of my way and ran flat out, head down, paying little 
attention to anything but the uneven stones beneath my feet. 

Coming out of the dark lane, I was blinded by the brilliant sunlight beating down into the 
principal plaza. The wind whooshed into me, flinging my hair into my eyes and blinding me 
further. It was no wonder that I didn't see the wall of flesh until I'd smacked into it. 

There was no pathway, no crevice between the close pressed bodies. I pushed against them 
furiously, fighting the hands that shoved back. I heard exclamations of irritation and even 
pain as I battled my way through, but none were in a language I understood. The faces were 
a blur of anger and surprise, surrounded by the ever-present red. A blond woman scowled at 
me, and the red scarf coiled around her neck looked l ik e a gruesome wound. A child, lifted 
on a man's shoulders to see over the crowd, grinned down at me, his lips distended over a set 




of plastic vampire fangs. 



The throng jostled around me, spinning me the wrong direction. I was glad the clock was so 
visible, or I'd never keep my course straight. But both hands on the clock pointed up toward 
the pitiless sun, and, though I shoved viciously against the crowd, I knew I was too late. I 
wasn't halfway across. I wasn't going to make it. I was stupid and slow and human, and we 
were all going to die because of it. 

I hoped Alice would get out. I hoped that she would see me from some dark shadow and 
know that I had failed, so she could go home to Jasper. 

I listened, above the angry exclamations, trying to hear the sound of discovery: the gasp, 
maybe the scream, as Edward came into someone's view. 

But there was a break in the crowd-I could see a bubble of space ahead. I pushed urgently 
toward it, not realizing till I bruised my shins against the bricks that there was a wide, square 
fountain set into the center of the plaza. 

I was nearly crying with relief as I flung my leg over the edge and ran through the knee-deep 
water. It sprayed all around me as I thrashed my way across the pool. Even in the sun, the 
wind was glacial, and the wet made the cold actually painful. But the fountain was very 
wide; it let me cross the center of the square and then some in mere seconds. I didn't pause 
when I hit the far edge-I used the low wall as a springboard, throwing myself into the crowd. 

They moved more readily for me now, avoiding the icy water that splattered from my 
dripping clothes as I ran. I glanced up at the clock again. 

A deep, booming chime echoed through the square. It throbbed in the stones under my feet. 
Children cried, covering their ears. And I started screaming as I ran. 

"Edward!" I screamed, knowing it was useless. The crowd was too loud, and my voice was 
breathless with exertion. But I couldn't stop screaming. 

The clock tolled again. I ran past a child in his mother's arms-his hair was almost white in 
the dazzling sunlight. A circle of tall men, all wearing red blazers, called out warnings as I 
barreled through them. The clock tolled again. 

On the other side of the men in blazers, there was a break in the throng, space between the 
sightseers who milled aimlessly around me. My eyes searched the dark narrow passage to the 
right of the wide square edifice under the tower. I couldn't see the street level-there were 
still too many people in the way. The clock tolled again. 

It was hard to see now. Without the crowd to break the wind, it whipped at my face and 
burned my eyes. I couldn't be sure if that was the reason behind my tears, or if I was crying in 
defeat as the clock tolled again. 

A little family of four stood nearest to the alley's mouth. The two girls wore crimson dresses, 




with matching ribbons tying their dark hair back. The father wasn't tall. It seemed like I 
could see something bright in the shadows, just over his shoulder. I hurtled toward them, 
trying to see past the stinging tears. The clock tolled, and the littlest girl clamped her hands 
over her ears. 

The older girl, just waist high on her mother, hugged her mother's leg and stared into the 
shadows behind them. As I watched, she tugged on her mother's elbow and pointed toward 
the darkness. The clock tolled, and I was so close now. 

I was close enough to hear her high-pitched voice. Her father stared at me in surprise as I 
bore down on them, rasping out Edward's name over and over again. 

The older girl giggled and said something to her mother, gesturing toward the shadows again 
impatiently. 

I swerved around the father-he clutched the baby out of my way-and sprinted for the gloomy 
breach behind them as the clock tolled over my head. 

"Edward, no!" I screamed, but my voice was lost in the roar of the chime. 

I could see him now. And I could see that he could not see me. 

It was really him, no hallucination this time. And I realized that my delusions were more 
flawed than I'd realized; they'd never done him justice. 

Edward stood, motionless as a statue, just a few feet from the mouth of the alley. His eyes 
were closed, the rings underneath them deep purple, his arms relaxed at his sides, his palms 
turned forward. His expression was very peaceful, like he was dreaming pleasant things. The 
marble skin of his chest was bare-there was a small pile of white fabric at his feet. The light 
reflecting from the pavement of the square gleamed dimly from his skin. 

I'd never seen anything more beautiful-even as I ran, gasping and screaming, I could 
appreciate that. And the last seven months meant nothing. And his words in the forest meant 
nothing. And it did not matter if he did not want me. I would never want anything but him, 
no matter how long I lived. 

The clock tolled, and he took a large stride toward the light. 

"No!" I screamed. "Edward, look at me!" 

He wasn't listening. He smiled very slightly. He raised his foot to take the step that would 
put h im directly in the path of the sun. 

I slammed into him so hard that the force would have hurled me to the ground if his arms 
hadn't caught me and held me up. It knocked my breath out of me and snapped my head 
back. 




His dark eyes opened slowly as the clock tolled again. 

He looked down at me with quiet surprise. 

"Amazing," he said, his exquisite voice full of wonder, slightly amused. "Carlisle was right." 

"Edward," I tried to gasp, but my voice had no sound. "You've got to get back into the 
shadows. You have to move!" 

He seemed bemused. His hand brushed softly against my cheek. He didn't appear to notice 
that I was trying to force him back. I could have been pushing against the alley walls for all 
the progress I was making. The clock tolled, but he didn't react. 

It was very strange, for I knew we were both in mortal danger. Still, in that instant, I felt 
well. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through 
my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin. It was like 
there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect-not healed, but as if there had been 
no wound in the first place. 

"I can't believe how quick it was. I didn't feel a thing-they're very good," he mused, closing 
his eyes again and pressing his lips against my hair. His voice was l ik e honey and velvet. 
"Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, hath had no power yet upon thy beauty," he 
murmured, and I recognized the line spoken by Romeo in the tomb. The clock boomed out 
its final chime "You smell just exactly the same as always," he went on. "So maybe this is 
hell. I don't care. I'll take it." 

"I'm not dead," I interrupted. "And neither are you! Please Edward, we have to move. They 
can't be far away!" 

I struggled in his arms, and his brow furrowed in confusion. 

"What was that?" he asked politely. 

"We're not dead, not yet! But we have to get out of here before the Volturi-" 

Comprehension flickered on his face as I spoke. Before I could finish, he suddenly yanked me 
away from the edge of the shadows, spinning me effortlessly so that my back was tight 
against the brick wall, and his back was to me as he faced away into the alley. His arms 
spread wide, protectively, in front of me. 

I peeked under his aim to see two dark shapes detach themselves from the gloom. 

"Greetings, gentlemen," Edward's voice was calm and pleasant, on the surface. "I don't think 
I'll be requiring your services today. I would appreciate it very much, however, if you would 
send my thanks to your masters." 



Shall we take this conversation to a more appropriate venue?" a smooth voice whispered 




menacingly. 



"I don't believe that will be necessary." Edward's voice was harder now. "I know your 
instructions, Felix. I haven't broken any rules." 

"Felix merely meant to point out the proximity of the sun," the other shadow said in a 
soothing tone. They were both concealed within smoky gray cloaks that reached to the 
ground and undulated in the wind. "Fet us seek better cover." 

"I'll be right behind you," Edward said dryly. "Bella, why don't you go back to the square and 
enjoy the festival?" 

"No, bring the girl," the first shadow said, somehow injecting a leer into his whisper. 

"I don't think so." The pretense of civility disappeared. Edward's voice was flat and icy. His 
weight shifted infinitesimally, and I could see that he was preparing to fight. 

"No." I mouthed the word. 

"Shh," he murmured, only for me. 

"Felix," the second, more reasonable shadow cautioned. "Not here." He turned to Edward. 
"Aro would simply l ik e to speak with you again, if you have decided not to force our hand 
after all." 

"Certainly," Edward agreed. "'But the girl goes free." 

"I'm afraid that's not possible," the polite shadow said regretfully. "We do have rules to 
obey." 

"Then I'm afraid that I'll be unable to accept Aro's invitation, Demetri." 

"That's just fine," Felix purred. My eyes were adjusting to the deep shade, and I could see 
that Felix was very big, tall and thick through the shoulders. His size reminded me of 
Emmett. 

"Aro will be disappointed," Demetri sighed. 

"I'm sure he'll survive the letdown," Edward replied. 

Felix and Demetri stole closer toward the mouth of the alley, spreading out slightly so they 
could come at Edward from two sides. They meant to force him deeper into the alley, to 
avoid a scene. No reflected light found access to their skin; they were safe inside their cloaks. 

Edward didn't move an inch. He was dooming himself by protecting me. 

Abruptly, Edward's head whipped around, toward the darkness of the winding alley, and 
Demetri and Felix did the same, in response to some sound or movement too subtle for my 




senses. 



"Let's behave ourselves, shall we?" a lilting voice suggested. "There are ladies present." 

Alice tripped lightly to Edward's side, her stance casual. There was no hint of any underlying 
tension. She looked so tiny, so fragile. Her little arms swung like a child's. 

Yet Demetri and Felix both straightened up, their cloaks swirling slightly as a gust of wind 
funneled through the alley. Felix's face soured. Apparently, they didn't l ik e even numbers. 

"We're not alone," she reminded them. 

Demetri glanced over his shoulder. A few yards into the square, the little family, with the 
girls in their red dresses, was watching us. The mother was speaking urgently to her husband, 
her eyes on the five of us. She looked away when Demetri met her gaze. The man walked a 
few steps farther into the plaza, and tapped one of the red-blazered men on the shoulder. 

Demetri shook his head. "Please, Edward, let's be reasonable," he said. 

"Fet's," Edward agreed. "And we'll leave quietly now, with no one the wiser." 

Demetri sighed in frustration. "At least let us discuss this more privately." 

Six men in red now joined the family as they watched us with anxious expressions. I was 
very conscious of Edward's protective stance in front of me-sure that this was what caused 
their alarm. I wanted to scream to them to run. 

Edward's teeth came together audibly. "No." 

Felix smiled. 

"Enough." 

The voice was high, reedy, and n came from behind us. 

I peeked under Edward's other arm to see a small, dark shape coming toward us. By the way 
the edges billowed, I knew it would be another one of them. Who else? 

At first I thought it was a young boy. The newcomer was as tiny as Alice, with lank, pale 
brown hair trimmed short. The body under the cloak-which was darker, almost black-was 
slim and androgynous. But the face was too pretty for a boy. The wide-eyed, full-lipped face 
would make a Botticelli angel look l ik e a gargoyle. Even allowing for the dull crimson irises. 

Her size was so insignificant that the reaction to her appearance confused me. Felix and 
Demetri relaxed immediately, stepping back from their offensive positions to blend again 
with the shadows of the overhanging walls. 

Edward dropped his arms and relaxed his position as well-but in defeat. 




"Jane," he sighed in recognition and resignation. 

Alice folded her arms across her chest, her expression impassive. 

"Follow me," Jane spoke again, her childish voice a monotone. She turned her back on us 
and drifted silently into the dark. 

Felix gestured for us to go first, smirking. 

Alice walked after the little Jane at once. Edward wrapped his arm around my waist and 
pulled me along beside her. The alley angled slightly downward as it narrowed. I looked up 
at him with frantic questions in my eyes, but he just shook his head. Though I couldn't hear 
the others behind us, I was sure they were there. 

"Well, Alice," Edward said conversationally as we walked. "I suppose I shouldn't be surprised 
to see you here." 

"It was my mistake," Alice answered in the same tone. "It was my job to set it right." 

"What happened?" His voice was polite, as if he were barely interested. I imagined this was 
due to the listening ears behind us. 

"It's a long story." Alice's eyes flickered toward me and away. "In summary, she did jump off 
a cliff, but she wasn't trying to kill herself. Bella's all about the extreme sports these days." 

I flushed and turned my eyes straight ahead, looking after the dark shadow that I could no 
longer see. I could imagine what he was hearing in Alice's thoughts now. Near-drownings, 
stalking vampires, werewolf friends. . . 

"Hm," Edward said curtly, and the casual tone of his voice was gone. 

There was a loose curve to the alley, still slanting downward, so I didn't see the squared-off 
dead end coming until we reached the flat, windowless, brick face. The little one called Jane 
was nowhere to be seen. 

Alice didn't hesitate, didn't break pace as she strode toward the wall. Then, with easy grace, 
she slid down an open hole in the street. 

It looked like a drain, sunk into the lowest point of the paving. I hadn't noticed it until Alice 
disappeared, but the grate was halfway pushed aside. The hole was small, and black. 

I balked. 

"It's all right, Bella," Edward said in a low voice. "Alice will catch you." 



I eyed the hole doubtfully. I imagine he would have gone first, if Demetri and Felix hadn't 
been waiting, smug and silent, behind us. 




I crouched down, swinging my legs into the narrow gap. 

"Alice?" I whispered, voice trembling. 

"I'm right here, Bella," she reassured me. Her voice came from too far below to make me feel 
better. 

Edward took my wrists-his hands felt l ik e stones in winter-and lowered me into the 
blackness. 

"Ready?" he asked. 

"Drop her," Alice called. 

I closed my eyes so I couldn't see the darkness, scrunching them together in terror, clamping 
my mouth shut so I wouldn't scream. Edward let me fall. 

It was silent and short. The air whipped past me for just half a second, and then, with a huff 
as I exhaled, Alice's waiting arms caught me. 

I was going to have bruises; her arms were very hard. She stood me upright. 

It was dim, but not black at the bottom. The light from the hole above provided a faint glow, 
reflecting wetly from the stones under my feet. The light vanished for a second, and then 
Edward was a faint, white radiance beside me. He put his arm around me, holding me close 
to his side, and began to tow me swiftly forward. I wrapped both arms around his cold waist, 
and tripped and stumbled my way across the uneven stone surface. The sound of the heavy 
grate sliding over the drain hole behind us rang with metallic finality. 

The dim light from the street was quickly lost in the gloom. The sound of my staggering 
footsteps echoed through the black space; it sounded very wide, but I couldn't be sure. There 
were no sounds other than my frantic heartbeat and my feet on the wet stones-except for 
once, when an impatient sigh whispered from behind me. 

Edward held me tightly. He reached his free hand across his body to hold my face, too, his 
smooth thumb tracing across my lips. Now and then, I felt his face press into my hair. I 
realized that this was the only reunion we would get, and I clutched myself closer to h im . 

For now, it felt like he wanted me, and that was enough to offset the horror of the 
subterranean tunnel and the prowling vampires behind us. It was probably no more than 
guilt-the same guilt that compelled him to come here to die when he'd believed that it was 
his fault that I'd killed myself. But I felt his lips press silently against my forehead, and I 
didn't care what the motivation was. At least I could be with him again before I died. That 
was better than a long life. 

I wished I could ask him exactly what was going to happen now. I wanted desperately to 
know how we were going to die-as if that would somehow make it better, knowing in 




advance. But I couldn't speak, even in a whisper, surrounded as we were. The others could 
hear everything-my every breath, my every heartbeat. 

The path beneath our feet continued to slant downward, taking us deeper into the ground, 
and it made me claustrophobic. Only Edward's hand, soothing against my face, kept me from 
screaming out loud. 

I couldn't tell where the light was coming from, but it slowly turned dark gray instead of 
black. We were in a low, arched tunnel. Long trails of ebony moisture seeped down the gray 
stones, like they were bleeding ink. 

I was shaking, and I thought it was from fear. It wasn't until my teeth started to chatter 
together that I realized I was cold. My clothes were still wet, and the temperature underneath 
the city was wintry. As was Edward's skin. 

He realized this at the same time I did, and let go of me, keeping only my hand. 

"N-n-no," I chattered, throwing my arms around him. I didn't care if I froze. Who knew how 
long we had left? 

His cold hand chafed against my arm, trying to warm me with the friction. 

We hurried through the tunnel, or it felt l ik e hurrying to me. My slow progress irritated 
someone-I guessed Felix-and I heard him heave a sigh now and then. 

At the end of the tunnel was a grate-the iron bars were rusting, but thick as my arm. A small 
door made of thinner, interlaced bars was standing open. Edward ducked through and 
hurried on to a larger, brighter stone room. The grille slammed shut with a clang, followed by 
the snap of a lock. I was too afraid to look behind me. 

On the other side of the long room was a low, heavy wooden door. It was very thick-as I 
could tell because it, too, stood open. 

We stepped through the door, and I glanced around me in surprise, relaxing automatically. 
Beside me, Edward tensed, his jaw clenched tight. 




21 VERDICT 



WE WERE IN A BRIGHTLY LIT, UNREMARKABLE HALLWAY. The walls were 
off-white, the floor carpeted in industrial gray. Common rectangular fluorescent lights were 
spaced evenly along the ceiling. It was warmer here, for which I was grateful. This hall 
seemed very benign after the gloom of the ghoulish stone sewers. 

Edward didn't seem to agree with my assessment. He glowered darkly down the long 
hallway, toward the slight, black shrouded figure at the end, standing by an elevator. 

He pulled me along, and Alice walked on my other side. The heavy door creaked shut behind 
us, and then there was the thud of a bolt sliding home. 

Jane waited by the elevator, one hand holding the doors open for us. Her expression was 
apathetic. 

Once inside the elevator, the three vampires that belonged to the Volturi relaxed further. 
They threw back their cloaks, letting the hoods fall back on their shoulders. Felix and 
Demetri were both of a slightly olive complexion-it looked odd combined with their chalky 
pallor. Felix's black hair was cropped short, but Demetri's waved to his shoulders. Their irises 
were deep crimson around the edges, darkening until they were black around the pupil. 
Under the shrouds, their clothes were modem, pale, and nondescript. I cowered in the corner, 
cringing against Edward. His hand still rubbed against my arm. He never took his eyes off 
Jane. 

The elevator ride was short; we stepped out into what looked like a posh office reception 
area. The walls were paneled in wood, the floors carpeted in thick, deep green. There were 
no windows, but large, brightly lit paintings of the Tuscan countryside hung everywhere as 
replacements. Pale leather couches were arranged in cozy groupings, and the glossy tables 
held crystal vases full of vibrantly colored bouquets. The flowers' smell reminded me of a 
funeral home. 

In the middle of the room was a high, polished mahogany counter. I gawked in astonishment 
at the woman behind it. 

She was tall, with dark skin and green eyes. She would have been very pretty in any other 
company-but not here. Because she was every bit as human as I was. I couldn't comprehend 
what this human woman was doing here, totally at ease, surrounded by vampnes. 

She smiled politely in welcome. "Good afternoon, Jane," she said. There was no surprise in 
her face as she glanced at Jane's company. Not Edward, his bare chest glinting dimly in the 
white lights, or even me, disheveled and comparatively hideous. 

Jane nodded. "Gianna." She continued toward a set of double doors in the back of the room, 
and we followed. 




As Felix passed the desk, he winked at Gianna, and she giggled. 



On the other side of the wooden doors was a different kind of reception. The pale boy in the 
pearl gray suit could have been Jane's twin. His hair was darker, and his lips were not as full, 
but he was just as lovely. He came forward to meet us. He smiled, reaching for her. "Jane." 

"Alec," she responded, embracing the boy. They kissed each other's cheeks on both sides. 
Then he looked at us. 

"They send you out for one and you come back with two... and a half," he noted, looking at 
me. "Nice work." 

She laughed-the sound sparkled with delight l ik e a baby's cooing. 

"Welcome back, Edward," Alec greeted him. "You seem in a better mood." 

"Marginally," Edward agreed in a flat voice. I glanced at Edward's hard face, and wondered 
how his mood could have been darker before. 

Alec chuckled, and examined me as I clung to Edward's side. "And this is the cause of all the 
trouble?" he asked, skeptical. 

Edward only smiled, his expression contemptuous. Then he froze. 

"Dibs," Felix called casually from behind. 

Edward turned, a low snarl building deep in his chest. Felix smiled-his hand was raised, palm 
up; he curled his fingers twice, inviting Edward forward. 

Alice touched Edward's arm. "Patience," she cautioned him. 

They exchanged a long glance, and I wished I could hear what she was telling him. I figured 
that it was something to do with not attacking Felix, because Edward took a deep breath and 
turned back to Alec. 

"Aro will be so pleased to see you again," Alec said, as if nothing had passed. 

"Let's not keep him waiting," Jane suggested. 

Edward nodded once. 

Alec and Jane, holding hands, led the way down yet another wide, ornate hall-would there 
ever be an end? 

They ignored the doors at the end of the hall-doors entirely sheathed in gold-stopping 
halfway down the hall and sliding aside a piece of the paneling to expose a plain wooden 
door. It wasn't locked. Alec held it open for Jane. 




I wanted to groan when Edward pulled me through to the other side of the door. It was the 
same ancient stone as the square, the alley, and the sewers. And it was dark and cold again. 

The stone antechamber was not large. It opened quickly into a brighter, cavernous room, 
perfectly round like a huge castle turret. . . which was probably exactly what it was. 

Two stories up, long window slits threw thin rectangles of bright sunlight onto the stone 
floor below. There were no artificial lights. The only furniture in the room were several 
massive wooden chairs, l ik e thrones, that were spaced unevenly, flush with the curving stone 
walls. In the very center of the circle, in a slight depression, was another drain. I wondered if 
they used it as an exit, like the hole in the street. 

The room was not empty. A handful of people were convened in seemingly relaxed 
conversation. The murmur of low, smooth voices was a gentle hum in the air. As I watched, 
a pair of pale women in summer dresses paused in a patch of light, and, like prisms, their skin 
threw the light in rainbow sparkles against the sienna walls. 

The exquisite faces all turned toward our party as we entered the room. Most of the 
immortals were dressed in inconspicuous pants and shirts-things that wouldn't stick out at all 
on the streets below. But the man who spoke first wore one of the long robes. It was 
pitch-black, and brushed against the floor. For a moment, I thought his long, jet-black hair 
was the hood of his cloak. 

"Jane, dear one, you've returned!" he cried in evident delight. His voice was just a soft 
sighing. 

He drifted forward, and the movement flowed with such surreal grace that I gawked, my 
mouth hangmg open. Even Alice, whose every motion looked l ik e dancing, could not 
compare. 

I was only more astonished as he floated closer and I could see his face. It was not l ik e the 
unnaturally attractive faces that surrounded him (for he did not approach us alone; the entire 
group converged around him, some following, and some walking ahead of him with the alert 
manner of bodyguards). I couldn't decide if his face was beautiful or not. I suppose the 
features were perfect. But he was as different from the vampires beside him as they were 
from me. His skin was translucently white, l ik e onionskin, and it looked just as delicate-it 
stood in shocking contrast to the long black hair that framed his face. I felt a strange, 
horrifying urge to touch his cheek, to see if it was softer than Edward's or Alice's, or if it was 
powdery, l ik e chalk. His eyes were red, the same as the others around him, but the color was 
clouded, milk y; I wondered if his vision was affected by the haze. 

He glided to Jane, took her face in his papery hands, kissed her lightly on her full lips, and 
then floated back a step. 



Yes, Master." Jane smiled; the expression made her look like an angelic child. "I brought 




him back alive, just as you wished." 

"Ah, Jane." He smiled, too. "You are such a comfort to me." 

He turned his misty eyes toward us, and the smile brightened-became ecstatic. 

"And Alice and Bella, too!" he rejoiced, clapping his thin hands together. "This is a happy 
surprise! Wonderful!" 

I stared in shock as he called our names informally, as if we were old friends dropping in for 
an unexpected visit. 

He turned to our hulking escort. "Felix, be a dear and tell my brothers about our company. 
I'm sure they wouldn't want to miss this." 

"Yes, Master." Felix nodded and disappeared back the way we had come. 

"You see, Edward?" The strange vampire turned and smiled at Edward l ik e a fond but 
scolding grandfather. "What did I tell you? Aren't you glad that I didn't give you what you 
wanted yesterday?" 

"Yes, Aro, I am," he agreed, tightening his arm around my waist. 

"I love a happy ending." Aro sighed. "They are so rare. But I want the whole story. How did 
this happen? Alice?" He turned to gaze at Alice with curious, misty eyes. "Your brother 
seemed to think you infallible, but apparently there was some mistake." 

"Oh, I'm far from infallible." She flashed a dazzling smile. She looked perfectly at ease, 
except that her hands were balled into tight little fists. "As you can see today, I cause 
problems as often as I cure them." 

"You're too modest," Aro chided. "I've seen some of your more amazing exploits, and I must 
admit I've never observed anything like your talent. Wonderful!" 

Alice flickered a glance at Edward. Aro did not miss it. 

"I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced properly at all, have we? It's just that I feel like I 
know you already, and I tend get ahead of myself. Your brother introduced us yesterday, in a 
peculiar way. You see, I share some of your brother's talent, only I am limited in a way that 
he is not." Aro shook his head; his tone was envious. 

"And also exponentially more powerful," Edward added dryly. He looked at Alice as he 
swiftly explained. "Aro needs physical contact to hear your thoughts, but he hears much more 
than I do. You know I can only hear what's passing through your head in the moment. Aro 
hears every thought your mind has ever had." 



Alice raised her delicate eyebrows, and Edward inclined his head. 




Aro didn't miss that either. 



"But to be able to hear from a distance..." Aro sighed, gesturing toward the two of them, 
and the exchange that had just taken place. "That would be so convenient ." 

Aro looked over our shoulders. All the other heads turned in the same direction, including 
Jane, Alec, and Demetri, who stood silently beside us. 

I was the slowest to turn. Felix was back, and behind h im floated two more black-robed 
men. Both looked very much like Aro, one even had the same flowing black hair. The other 
had a shock of snow-white hair-the same shade as his face-that brushed against his 
shoulders. Their faces had identical, paper-thin s ki n. 

The trio from Carlisle's painting was complete, unchanged by the last three hundred years 
since it was painted. 

"Marcus, Caius, look!" Aro crooned. "Bella is alive after all, and Alice is here with her! Isn't 
that wonderful?" 

Neither of the other two looked as if wonderful would be their first choice of words. The 
dark-haired man seemed utterly bored, l ik e he'd seen too many millennia of Aro's enthusiasm. 
The other's hice was sour under the snowy hair. 

Their lack of interest did not curb Aro's enjoyment. 

"Let us have the story," Aro almost sang in his feathery voice. 

The white-haired ancient vampire drifted away, gliding toward one of the wooden thrones. 
The other paused beside Aro, and he reached his hand out, at first I thought to take Aro's 
hand. But he just touched Aro's palm briefly and then dropped his hand to his side. Aro 
raised one black brow. I wondered how his papery skin did not crumple in the effort. 

Edward snorted very quietly, and Alice looked at him, curious. 

"Thank you, Marcus," Aro said. "That's quite interesting." 

I realized, a second late, that Marcus was letting Aro know his thoughts. 

Marcus didn't look interested. He glided away from Aro to join the one who must be Caius, 
seated against the wall. Two of the attending vampires followed silently behind 
him-bodyguards, l ik e I'd thought before. I could see that the two women in the sundresses 
had gone to stand beside Caius in the same manner. The idea of any vampire needing a guard 
was faintly ridiculous to me, but maybe the ancient ones were as frail as their skin suggested. 

Aro was shaking his head. "Amazing, 1 " he said. "Absolutely amazing." 

Alice's expression was frustrated. Edward turned to her and explained again in a swift, low 




voice. "Marcus sees relationships. He's surprised by the intensity of ours. 



Aro smiled. "So convenient," he repeated to himself. Then he spoke to us. "It takes quite a 
bit to surprise Marcus, I can assure you." 

I looked at Marcus's dead face, and I believed that. 

"It's just so difficult to understand, even now," Aro mused, staring at Edward's arm wrapped 
around me. It was hard for me to follow Aro's chaotic train of thought. I struggled to keep 
up. "How can you stand so close to het like that?" 

"It's not without effort," Edward answered calmly. 

"But still — /« tua cantante ! What a waste!" 

Edward chuckled once without humor. "I look at it more as a price." 

Aro was skeptical. "A very high price." 

"Opportunity cost." 

Aro laughed. "If I hadn't smelled her through your memories, I wouldn't have believed the 
call of anyone's blood could be so strong. I've never felt anything like it myself. Most of us 
would trade much for such a gift, and yet you. . ." 

"Waste it," Edward finished, his voice sarcastic now. 

Aro laughed again. "Ah, how I miss my friend Carlisle! You remind me of him-only he was 
not so angry." 

"Carlisle outshines me in many other ways as well." 

"I certainly never thought to see Carlisle bested for self-control of all things, but you put him 
to shame." 

"Hardly." Edward sounded impatient. As if he were tired of the preliminaries. It made me 
more afraid; I couldn't help but try to imagine what he expected would follow. 

"I am gratified by his success," Aro mused. "Your memories of him are quite a gift for me, 
though they astonish me exceedingly. I am surprised by how it... pleases me, his success in 
this unorthodox path he's chosen. I expected that he would waste, weaken with time. I'd 
scoffed at his plan to find others who would share his peculiar vision. Yet, somehow, I'm 
happy to be wrong." 

Edward didn't reply. 

"But your restraint!" Aro sighed. "I did not know such strength was possible. To inure 
yourself against such a siren call, not just once but again and again-if I had not felt it myself, 




I would not have believed. 



Edward gazed back at Aro's admiration with no expression. I knew his face well 
enough-time had not changed that-to guess at something seething beneath the surface. I 
fought to keep my breathing even. 

"Just remembering how she appeals to you. . ." Aro chuckled. "It makes me thirsty." 

Edward tensed. 

"Don't be disturbed," Aro reassured him. "I mean her no harm. But I am so curious, about 
one thing in particular." He eyed me with bright interest. "May I?" he asked eagerly, lifting 
one hand. 

"Ask her” Edward suggested in a flat voice. 

"Of course, how rude of me!" Aro exclaimed. "Bella," he addressed me directly now. "I'm 
fascinated that you are the one exception to Edward's impressive talent-so very interesting 
that such a thing should occur! And I was wondering, since our talents are similar in many 
ways, if you would be so kind as to allow me to try-to see if you are an exception for me, as 
well?" 

My eyes flashed up to Edward's face in terror. Despite Aro's overt politeness, I didn't believe 
I really had a choice. I was horrified at the thought of allowing him to touch me, and yet also 
perversely intrigued by the chance to feel his strange s ki n. 

Edward nodded in encouragement-whether because he was sure Aro would not hurt me, or 
because there was no choice, I couldn't tell. 

I turned back to Aro and raised my hand slowly in front of me. It was trembling. 

He glided closer, and I believe he meant his expression to be reassuring. But his papery 
features were too strange, too alien and frightening, to reassure. The look on his face was 
more confident than his words had been. 

Aro reached out, as if to shake my hand, and pressed his insubstantial-looking skin against 
mine. It was hard, but felt brittle-shale rather than granite-and even colder than I expected. 

His filmy eyes smiled down at mine, and it was impossible to look away. They were 
mesmerizing in an odd, unpleasant way. 

Aro's face altered as I watched. The confidence wavered and became first doubt, then 
incredulity before he calmed it into a friendly mask. 

"So very interesting," he said as he released my hand and drifted back. 

My eyes flickered to Edward, and, though his face was composed, I thought he seemed a 




little smug. 



Aro continued to drift wnh a thoughtful expression. He was quiet for a moment, his eyes 
flickering between the three of us. Then, abruptly, he shook his head. 

"A first," he said to himself "I wonder if she is immune to our other talents. . . Jane, dear?" 

"No!" Edward snarled the word. Alice grabbed his arm with a restraining hand. He shook her 
off. 

Little Jane smiled up happily at Aro. "Yes, Master?" 

Edward was truly snarling now, the sound ripping and tearing from him, glaring at Aro with 
baleful eyes. The room had gone still, everyone watching him with amazed disbelief, as if he 
were committing some embarrassing social faux pas. I saw Felix grin hopefully and move a 
step forward. Aro glanced at him once, and he froze in place, his grin turning to a sulky 
expression. 

Then he spoke to Jane. "I was wondering, my dear one, if Bella is immune to you!' 

I could barely hear Aro over Edward's furious growls. He let go of me, moving to hide me 
from their view. Caius ghosted in our direction, with his entourage, to watch. 

Jane turned toward us with a beatific smile. 

"Don't!" Alice cried as Edward launched himself at the little girl. 

Before I could react, before anyone could jump between them, before Aro's bodyguards 
could tense, Edward was on the ground. 

No one had touched him, but he was on the stone floor writhing in obvious agony, while I 
stared in horror. 

Jane was smiling only at him now, and it all clicked together. What Alice had said about 
formidable gifts , why everyone treated Jane with such deference, and why Edward had 
thrown himself in her path before she could do that to me. 

"Stop!" I shrieked, my voice echoing in the silence, jumping forward to put myself between 
them. But Alice threw her arms around me in an unbreakable grasp and ignored my struggles. 
No sound escaped Edward's lips as he cringed against the stones. It felt l ik e my head would 
explode from the pain of watching this. 

"Jane," Aro recalled her in a tranquil voice. She looked up quickly, still smiling with pleasure, 
her eyes questioning. As soon as Jane looked away, Edward was still. 

Aro inclined his head toward me. 

Jane turned her smile in my direction. 




I didn't even meet her gaze. I watched Edward from the prison of Alice's arms, still 
struggling pointlessly. 

"He's fine," Alice whispered in a tight voice. As she spoke, he sat up, and then sprang lightly 
to his feet. His eyes met mine, and they were horror-struck. At first I thought the horror was 
for what he had just suffered. But then he looked quickly at Jane, and back to me-and his 
face relaxed into relief. 

I looked at Jane, too, and she no longer smiled. She glared at me, her jaw clenched with the 
intensity of her focus. I shrank back, waiting for the pain. 

Nothing happened. 

Edward was by my side again. He touched Alice's arm, and she surrendered me to him. 

Aro started to laugh. "Ha, ha. ha," he chuckled. "This is wonderful!" 

Jane hissed in frustration, leaning forward l ik e she was preparing to spring. 

"Don't be put out, dear one," Aro said in a comforting tone, placing a powder-light hand on 
her shoulder. "She confounds us all." 

Jane's upper lip curled back ever her teeth as she continued to glare at me. 

"Ha, ha, ha," Aro chortled again. "You're very brave, Edward, to endure in silence. I asked 
Jane to do that to me once-just out of curiosity." He shook his head in admiration. 

Edward glared, disgusted. 

"So what do we do with you now?" Aro sighed. 

Edward and Alice stiffened. This was the part they'd been waiting for. I began to tremble. 

"I don't suppose there's any chance that you've changed your mind?" Aro asked Edward 
hopefully. "Your talent would be an excellent addition to our little company." 

Edward hesitated. From the comer of my eye, I saw both Felix and Jane grimace. 

Edward seemed to weigh each word before he spoke it. "I'd. . . rather. . . not." 

"Alice?" Aro asked, still hopeful. "Would you perhaps be interested in joining with us?" 

"No, thank you," Alice said. 

"And you, Bella?" Aro raised his eyebrows. 

Edward hissed, low in my ears. I stared at Aro blankly. Was he joking? Or was he really 
asking me if I wanted to stay for dinner? 




It was the white-haired Caius who broke the silence. 



"What?" he demanded of Aro; his voice, though no more than a whisper, was flat. 

"Caius, surely you see the potential," Aro chided him affectionately. "I haven't seen a 
prospective talent so promising since we found Jane and Alec. Can you imagine the 
possibilities when she is one of us?" 

Caius looked away with a caustic expression. Jane's eyes sparked with indignation at the 
comparison. 

Edward fumed beside me. I could hear a rumble in his chest, building toward a growl. I 
couldn't let his temper get h im hurt. 

"No, thank you," I spoke up in barely more than a whisper, my voice breaking in fright. 

Aro sighed. "That's unfortunate. Such a waste." 

Edward hissed. "Join or die, is that it? I suspected as much when we were brought to this 
room. So much for your laws." 

The tone of his voice surprised me. He sounded irate, but there was something deliberate 
about his delivery-as if he'd chosen his words with great care. 

"Of course not." Aro blinked, astonished. "We were already convened here, Edward, 
awaiting Heidi's return. Not for you." 

"Aro," Caius hissed. "The law claims them." 

Edward glared at Caius. "How so?" he demanded. He must have known what Caius was 
thinking, but he seemed determined to make him speak it aloud. 

Caius pointed a skeletal finger at me. "She knows too much. You have exposed our secrets." 
His voice was papery thin, just like his s ki n. 

"There are a few humans in on your charade here, as well," Edward reminded him, and I 
thought of the pretty receptionist below. 

Caius's face twisted into a new expression. Was it supposed to be a smiled. 

"Yes," he agreed. "But when they are no longer useful to us, they will serve to sustain us. 
That is not your plan for this one. If she betrays our secrets, are you prepared to destroy her? I 
think not," he scoffed. 

"I wouldn't-," I began, still whispering. Caius silenced me with an icy look. 

"Nor do you intend to make her one of us," Caius continued. "Therefore, she is a 
vulnerability. Though it is true, for this, only her life is forfeit. You may leave if you wish." 




Edward bared his teeth. 



"That's what I thought," Caius said, with something akin to pleasure. Felix leaned forward, 
eager. 

"Unless..." Aro interrupted. He looked unhappy with the way the conversation had gone. 
"Unless you do intend to give her immortality?" 

Edward pursed his lips, hesitating for a moment before he answered. "And if I do?" 

Aro smiled, happy again. "Why, then you would be free to go home and give my regards to 
my friend Carlisle." His expression turned more hesitant. "But I'm afraid you would have to 
mean it." 

Aro raised his hand in front of him. 

Caius, who had begun to scowl furiously, relaxed. 

Edward's lips tightened into a fierce line. He stared into my eyes, and I stared back. 

"Mean it," I whispered. "Please." 

Was it really such a loathsome idea? Would he rather die than change me? I felt l ik e I'd been 
kicked in the stomach. 

Edward stared down at me with a tortured expression. 

And then Alice stepped away from us, forward toward Aro. We turned to watch her. Her 
hand was raised l ik e his. 

She didn't say anything, and Aro waved off his anxious guard as they moved to block her 
approach. Aro met her halfway, and took her hand with an eager, acquisitive glint in his eyes. 

He bent his head over their touching hands, his eyes closing as he concentrated. Alice was 
motionless, her face blank. I heard Edward's teeth snap together. 

No one moved. Aro seemed frozen over Alice's hand. The seconds passed and I grew more 
and more stressed, wondering how much time would pass before it was too much time. 
Before it meant something was wrong-more wrong than it already was. 

Another agonizing moment passed, and then Aro's voice broke the silence. 

"Ha, ha, ha," he laughed, his head still bent forward. He looked up slowly, his eyes bright 
with excitement. "That was fascinating 

Alice smiled dryly. "I'm glad you enjoyed it." 

"To see the things you've seen-especially the ones that haven't happened yet!" He shook his 




head in wonder. 



"But that will," she reminded him, voice calm. 

"Yes, yes, it's quite determined. Certainly there's no problem." 

Caius looked bitterly disappointed-a feeling he seemed to share with Felix and Jane. 

"Aro," Caius complained. 

"Dear Caius," Aro smiled. "Do not fret. Think of the possibilities! They do not join us today, 
but we can always hope for the future. Imagine the joy young Alice alone would bring to our 
little household. . . Besides, I'm so terribly curious to see how Bella turns out!" 

Aro seemed convinced. Did he not realize how subjective Alice's visions were.' That she 
could make up her mind to transform me today, and then change it tomorrow? A million tiny 
decisions, her decisions and so many others', too-Edward's-could alter her path, and with 
that, the future. 

And would it really matter that Alice was willing, would it make any difference if I did 
become a vampire, when the idea was so repulsive to Edward? If death was, to him, a better 
alternative than having me around forever, an immortal annoyance? Terrified as I was, I felt 
myself sinking down into depression, drowning in it. . . 

"Then we are free to go now?" Edward asked in an even voice. 

"Yes, yes," Aro said pleasantly. "But please visit again. It's been absolutely enthralling!" 

"And we will visit you as well," Caius promised, his eyes suddenly half-closed like the 
heavy-lidded gaze of a lizard. "To be sure that you follow through on your side. Were I you, I 
would not delay too long. We do not offer second chances." 

Edward's jaw clenched tight, but he nodded once. 

Caius smirked and drifted back to where Marcus still sat, unmoving and uninterested. 

Felix groaned. 

"Ah, Felix." Aro smiled, amused. "Heidi will be here at any moment. Patience." 

"Hmm." Edward's voice had a new edge to it. "In that case, perhaps we'd better leave sooner 
rather than later." 

"Yes," Aro agreed. "That's a good idea. Accidents do happen. Please wait below until after 
dark, though, if you don't mind." 

"Of course," Edward agreed, while I cringed at the thought of waiting out the day before we 
could escape. 




"And here," Aro added, motioning to Felix with one finger. Felix came forward at once, and 
Aro unfastened the gray cloak the huge vampire wore, pulling from his shoulders. He tossed 
it to Edward. "Take this. You're a little conspicuous." 

Edward put the long cloak on, leaving the hood down. 

Aro sighed. "It suits you." 

Edward chuckled, but broke off suddenly, glancing over his shoulder. "Thank you, Aro. We'll 
wait below." 

"Goodbye, young friends," Aro said, his eyes bright as he stared in the same direction. 

"Let's go," Edward said, urgent now. 

Demetri gestured that we should follow, and then set off the way we'd come in, the only exit 
by the look of things. 

Edward pulled me swiftly along beside him. Alice was close by my other side, her face hard. 
"Not fast enough," she muttered. 

I stared up at her, frightened, but she only seemed chagrined. It was then that I first heard the 
babble of voices-loud, rough voices-coming from the antechamber. 

"Well this is unusual," a man's coarse voice boomed. 

"So medieval," an unpleasantly shrill, female voice gushed back. 

A large crowd was coming through the little door, filling the smaller stone chamber. Demetri 
motioned for us to make room. We pressed back against the cold wall to let them pass. 

The couple in front, Americans from the sound of them, glanced around themselves with 
appraising eyes. 

"Welcome, guests! Welcome to Volterra!" I could hear Aro sing from the big turret room. 

The rest of them, maybe forty or more, filed in after the couple. Some studied the setting l ik e 
tourists. A few even snapped pictures. Others looked confused, as if the story that had led 
them to this room was not making sense anymore. I noticed one small, dark woman in 
particular. Around her neck was a rosary, and she gripped the cross tightly in one hand. She 
walked more slowly than the others, touching someone now and then and asking a question 
in an unfamiliar language. No one seemed to understand her, and her voice grew more 
panicked. 

Edward pulled my face against his chest, but it was too late. I already understood. 

As soon as the smallest break appeared, Edward pushed me quickly toward the door. I could 




feel the horrified expression on my face, and the tears beginning to pool in my eyes. 



The ornate golden hallway was quiet, empty except for one gorgeous, statuesque woman. 
She stared at us curiously, me in particular. 

"Welcome home, Heidi," Demetri greeted her from behind us. 

Heidi smiled absently. She reminded me of Rosalie, though they looked nothing alike-it was 
just that her beauty, too, was exceptional, unforgettable. I couldn't seem to look away. 

She was dressed to emphasize that beauty. Her amazingly long legs, darkened with tights, 
were exposed by the shortest of minis ki rts. Her top was long-sleeved and high-necked, but 
extremely close-fitting, and constructed of red vinyl. Her long mahogany hair was lustrous, 
and her eyes were the strangest shade of violet-a color that might result from blue-tinted 
contacts over red irises. 

"Demetri," she responded in a silky voice, her eyes flickering between my face and Edward's 
gray cloak. 

"Nice fishing," Demetri complimented her, and I suddenly understood the attention-grabbing 
outfit she wore. . . she was not only the fisherman, but also the bait. 

"Thanks." She flashed a stunning smile. "Aren't you coming?" 

"In a minute. Save a few for me." 

Heidi nodded and ducked through the door with one last curious look at me. 

Edward set a pace that had me running to keep up. But we still couldn't get through the 
ornate door at the end of the hallway before the screaming started. 




22 FLIGHT 



DEMETRI LEFT US IN THE CHEERFULLY OPULENT RECEPTION area, where the 
woman Gianna was still at her post behind the polished counter. Bright, harmless music 
tinkled from hidden speakers. 

"Do not leave until dark," he warned us. 

Edward nodded, and Demetri hurried away. 

Gianna did not seem at all surprised by the exchange, though she did eye Edward's borrowed 
cloak with shrewd speculation. 

"Are you all right?" Edward asked under his breath, to low for the human woman to hear. 
His voice was rough-if velvet can be rough-with anxiety. Still stressed by our situation, I 
imagined. 

"You'd better make her sit before she falls," Alice said. "She's going to pieces." 

It was only then that I realize I was shaking, shaking hard, my entire frame vibrating until my 
teeth chattered and the room around me seemed to wobble and blur in my eyes. For one wild 
second, I wondered if this was how Jacob felt just before exploding into a werewolf. 

I heard a sound that didn't make sense, a strange, ripping counterpart to the otherwise cheery 
background music. Distracted by the shaking, I couldn't tell where it was coming from. 

"Shh, Bella, shh," Edward said as he pulled me to the sofa farthest away from the curious 
human at the desk. 

"I think she's having hysterics. Maybe you should slap her," Alice suggested. 

Edward threw a frantic glance at her. 

Then I understood. Oh. The noise was me. The ripping sound was the sobs coming from my 
chest. That's what was shaking me. 

"It's all right, you're safe, it's all right," he chanted again and again. He pulled ne onto his lap 
and tucked the thick wool cloak around me, protecting me from his cold s ki n. 

I knew it was stupid to react like this. Who knew how much time I had to look at his race? 
He was saved, and I was saved, and he could leave me as soon as we were free. To have my 
eyes so filled with tears that I could not see his features clearly was wasteful-insanity. 

But, behind my eyes where the tears could not wash the image away, I could still see the 
panicked face of the tiny woman with the rosary. 



'All those people," I sobbed. 




'I know," he whispered. 



"It's so horrible." 

"Yes, it is. I wish you hadn't had to see that." 

I rested my head against his cold chest, using the thick cloak to wipe my eyes. I took a few 
deep breaths, trying to calm myself. 

"Is there anything I can get you?" a voice asked politely. It was Gianna, leaning over 
Edward's shoulder with a look that was both concerned and yet still professional and 
detached at the same time. It didn't seem to bother her that her face was inches from a hostile 
vampire. She was either totally oblivious, or very good at her job. 

"No," Edward answered coldly. 

She nodded, smiled at me, and then disappeared. 

I waited until she was out of hearing range. "Does she know what's going on here?" I 
demanded, my voice low and hoarse. I was getting control of myself, my breathing evening 
out. 

"Yes. She knows everything," Edward told me. 

"Does she know they're going to kill her someday?" 

"She's knows it's a possibility," he said. 

That surprised me. 

Edward's face was hard to read. "She's hoping they'll decide to keep her." 

I felt the blood leave my face. "She wants to be one of them?" 

He nodded once, his eyes sharp on my face, watching my reaction. 

I shuddered. "How can she want that?" I whispered, more to myself than really looking for an 
answer. "How can she watch those people file through to that hideous room and want to be 
a part of that?' 

Edward didn't answer. His expression twisted in response to something I'd said. 

As I stared at his too beautiful face, trying to understand the change, it suddenly struck me 
that I was really here, in Edward's arms, however fleetingly, and that we were not-at this 
exact moment-about to be killed. 

"Oh, Edward," I cried, and I was sobbing again. It was such a stupid reaction. The tears were 
too thick for me to see his face again, and that was inexcusable. I only had until sunset for 




sure. Like a fairy tale again, with deadlines that ended the magic. 

"What's wrong?" he asked, still anxious, rubbing my back with gentle pats. 

I wrapped my arms around his neck-what was the worst he could do? Just push me 
away-and hugged myself closer to him. "Is it really sick for me to be happy right now?" I 
asked. My voice broke twice. 

He didn't push me away. He pulled me tight against his ice-hard chest, so tight it was hard to 
breathe, even with my lungs securely intact. "I know exactly what you mean," he whispered. 
"But we have lots of reasons to be happy. For one, we're alive." 

"Yes," I agreed. "That's a good one." 

"And together," he breathed. His breath was so sweet it made my head swim. 

I just nodded, sure that he did not place the same weight on that consideration as I did. 

"And, with any luck, we'll still be alive tomorrow." 

"Hopefully," I said uneasily. 

"The outlook is quite good," Alice assured me. She'd been so quiet, I'd almost forgotten her 
presence. "I'll see Jasper in less than twenty-four hours," she added in a satisfied tone. 

Lucky Alice. She could trust her future. 

I couldn't keep my eyes off of Edward's face for long. I stared at him, wishing more than 
anything that the future would never happen. That this moment would last forever, or, if it 
couldn't, that I would stop existing when it did. 

Edward stared right back at me, his dark eyes soft, and it was easy to pretend that he felt the 
same way. So that's what I did. I pretended, to make the moment sweeter. 

His fingertips traced the circles under my eyes. "You look so tired." 

"And you look thirsty," I whispered back, studying the purple bruises under his black irises. 

He shrugged. "It's nothing." 

"Are you sure? I could sit with Alice," I offered, unwilling; I'd rather he killed me now than 
move one inch from where I was. 

"Don't be ridiculous." He sighed; his sweet breath caressed my face. "I've never been in 
better control of that side of my nature than right now." 

I had a million questions for him. One of them bubbled to my lips now, but I held my tongue. 
I didn't want to ruin the moment, as imperfect as it was, here in this room that made me sick, 




under the eyes of the would-be monster. 



Here in his arms, it was so easy to fantasize that he wanted me. I didn't want to think about 
his motivations now-about whether he acted this way to keep me calm while we were still in 
danger, or if he just felt guilty for where we were and relieved that he wasn't responsible for 
my death. Maybe the time apart had been enough that I didn't bore him for the moment. But 
it didn't matter. I was so much happier pretending. 

I lay quiet in his arms, re-memorizing his face, pretending. . . 

He stared at my face like he was doing the same, while he and Alice discussed how to get 
home. Their voices were so quick and low that I knew Gianna couldn't understand. I missed 
half of it myself. It sounded l ik e more theft would be involved, though. I wondered idly if the 
yellow Porsche had made it back to its owner yet. 

"What was all that talk about singers ?" Alice asked at one point. 

" La tua cantante, " Edward said. His voice made the words into music. 

"Yes, that," Alice said, and I concentrated for a moment. I'd wondered about that, too, at the 
time. 

I felt Edward shrug around me. "They have a name for someone who smells the way Bella 
does to me. They call her my singer-becmse her blood sings for me." 

Alice laughed. 

I was tired enough to sleep, but I fought against the weariness. I wasn't going to miss a 
second of the time I had with him. Now and then, as he talked with Alice, he would lean 
down suddenly and kiss me-his glass- smooth lips brushing against my hair, my forehead, the 
tip of my nose. Each time it was l ik e an electric shock to my long dormant heart. The sound 
of its beating seemed to fill the entire room. 

It was heaven-right smack in the middle of hell. 

I lost track of the time completely. So when Edward's arms tightened around me, and both 
he and Alice looked to the back of the room with wary eyes, I panicked. I cringed into 
Edward's chest as Alec-his eyes now a vivid ruby, but still spotless in his light gray suit 
despite the afternoon meal-walked through the double doors. 

It was good news. 

"You're free to leave now," Alec told us, his tone so warm you'd think we were all lifelong 
friends. "We ask that you don't linger in the city." 

Edward made no answering pretence; his voice was ice cold. "That won't be a problem." 




Alec smiled, nodded, and disappeared again. 



"Follow the right hallway around the comer to the first set of elevators," Gianna told us as 
Edward helped me to my feet. "The lobby is two floors down, and exits to the street. 
Goodbye, now," she added pleasantly. I wondered if her competence would be enough to 
save her. 

Alice shot her a dark look. 

I was relieved there was another way out; I wasn't sure if I could handle another tour through 
the underground. 

We left through a tastefully luxurious lobby. I was the only one who glanced back at the 
medieval castle that housed the elaborate business facade I couldn't see the turret from here, 
for which I was grateful. 

The party was still in full swing in the streets. The street lamps were just coming on as we 
walked swiftly through the narrow, cobbled lanes. The sky was a dull, fading gray overhead, 
but the buildings crowded the streets so closely that it felt darker. 

The party was darker, too. Edward's long, trailing cloak did not stand out in the way it might 
have on a normal evening in Volterra. There were others in black satin cloaks now, and the 
plastic fangs I'd seen on the child in the square today seemed to be very popular with the 
adults. 

"Ridiculous," Edward muttered once. 

I didn't notice when Alice disappeared from beside me. I looked over to ask her a question, 
and she was gone. 

"Where's Alice?" I whispered in a panic. 

"She went to retrieve your bags from where she stashed them this morning." 

I'd forgotten that I had access to a toothbrush. It brightened my outlook considerably. 

"She's stealing a car, too, isn’t she?" I guessed. 

He grinned. "Not till we're outside." 

It seemed l ik e a very long way to the entryway. Edward could see that I was spent; he wound 
his arm around my waist and supported most of my weight as we walked. 

I shuddered as he pulled me through the dark stone archway. The huge, ancient portcullis 
above was like a cage door, threatening to drop on us, to lock us in. 

He led me toward a dark car, waiting in a pool of shadow to the right of the gate with the 




engine running. To my surprise, he slid into the backseat with me, instead of insisting on 
driving. 

Alice was apologetic. "I'm sorry." She gestured vaguely toward the dashboard. "There wasn't 
much to choose from." 

"It's fine, Alice." He grinned. "They can't all be 911 Turbos." 

She sighed. "I may have to acquire one of those legally. It was fabulous." 

"I'll get you one for Christmas," Edward promised. 

Alice turned to beam at him, which worried me, as she was already speeding down the dark 
and curvy hillside at the same time. 

"Yellow," she told h im . 

Edward kept me tight in his arms. Inside the gray cloak, I was warm and comfortable. More 
than comfortable. 

"You can sleep now, Bella," he murmured. "It's over." 

I knew he meant the danger, the nightmare in the ancient city, but I still had to swallow hard 
before I could answer. 

"I don't want to sleep. I'm not tired." Just the second part was a lie. I wasn't about to close 
my eyes. The car was only dimly lit by the dashboard controls, but it was enough that I could 
see his face. 

He pressed his lips to the hollow under my ear. "Try," he encouraged. 

I shook my head. 

He sighed. "You're still just as stubborn." 

I was stubborn; I fought with my heavy lids, and I won. 

The dark road was the hardest part; the bright lights at the airport in Florence made it easier, 
as did the chance to brush my teeth and change into clean clothes; Alice bought Edward new 
clothes, too, and he left the dark cloak on a pile of trash in an alley. The plane trip to Rome 
was so short that there wasn't really a chance for the fatigue to drag me under. I knew the 
flight from Rome to Atlanta would be another matter entirely, so I asked the flight attendant 
if she could bring me a Coke. 

"Bella," Edward said disapprovingly. He knew my low tolerance for caffeine. 

Alice was behind us. I could hear her murmuring to Jasper on the phone. 




"I don't want to sleep," I reminded him. I gave him an excuse that was believable because it 
was true. "If I close my eyes now. I'll see things I don't want to see. I'll have nightmares." 

He didn't argue with me after that. 

It would have been a very good time to talk, to get the answers I needed-needed but not 
really wanted; I was already despairing at the thought of what I might hear. We had an 
uninterrupted block of tirre ahead of us, and he couldn't escape me on an airplane-well, not 
easily, at least. No one would hear us except Alice; it was late, and most of the passengers 
were turning off lights and asking for pillows in muted voices. Talk would help me fight off 
the exhaustion. 

But, perversely, I bit my tongue against the flood of questions. My reasoning was probably 
flawed by exhaustion, but I hoped that by postponing the discussion, I could buy a few more 
hours with him at some later time-spin this out for another night, Scheherazade- style. 

So I kept drinking soda, and resisting even the urge to blink. Edward seemed perfectly 
content to hold me in his arms, his fingers tracing my face again and again. I touched his 
face, too. I couldn't stop myself, though I was afraid it would hurt me later, when I was alone 
again. He continued to kiss my hair, my forehead, my wrists... but never my lips, and that 
was good. After all, how many ways can one heart be mangled and still be expected to keep 
beating? I'd lived through a lot that should have finished me in the last few days, but it didn't 
make me feel strong. Instead, I felt horribly fragile, l ik e one word could shatter me. 

Edward didn't speak. Maybe he was hoping I would sleep. Maybe he had nothing to say. 

I won the fight against my heavy lids. I was awake when we reached the airport in Atlanta, 
and I even watched the sun beginning to rise over Seattle's cloud cover before Edward slid 
the window shut. I was proud of myself. I hadn't missed one minute. 

Neither Alice nor Edward was surprised by the reception that waited for us at Sea-Tac 
airport, but it caught me off guard. Jasper was the first one I saw-he didn't seem to see me at 
all. His eyes were only for Alice. She went quickly to his side; they didn't embrace l ik e other 
couples meeting there. They only stared into each other's faces, yet, somehow, the moment 
was so private that I still felt the need to look away. 

Carlisle and Esme waited in a quiet comer far from the line for the metal detectors, in the 
shadow of a wide pillar. Esme reached for me, hugging me fiercely, yet awkwardly, because 
Edward kept his arms around me, too. 

"Thank you so much," she said in my ear. 

Then she threw her arms around Edward, and she looked l ik e she would be crying if that 
were possible. 



You will never put me through :hat again," she nearly growled. 




Edward grinned, repentant. "Sorry, Mom." 

"Thank you, Bella," Carlisle said. "We owe you." 

"Hardly," I mumbled. The sleepless night was suddenly overpowering. My head felt 
disconnected from my body. 

"She's dead on her feet," Esme scolded Edward. "Let's get her home." 

Not sure if home was what I wanted at this point, I stumbled, half-blind, through the airport, 
Edward dragging me on one side and Esme on the other. I didn't know if Alice and Jasper 
were behind us or not, and I was too exhausted to look. 

I think I was mostly asleep, though I was still walking, when we reached their car. The 
surprise of seeing Emmett and Rosalie leaning against the black sedan under the dim lights of 
the parking garage revived me some. Edward stiffened. 

"Don't," Esme whispered. "She feels awful." 

"She should," Edward said, making no attempt to keep his voice down. 

"It's not her fault," I said, my words garbled with exhaustion. 

"Let her make amends," Esme pleaded. "We'll ride with Alice and Jasper." 

Edward glowered at the absurdly lovely blond vampire waiting for us. 

"Please, Edward," I said. I didn't want to ride with Rosalie any more than he seemed to, but 
I'd caused more than enough discord in his family. 

He sighed, and towed me toward the car. 

Emmett and Rosalie got in the front seat without speaking, while Edward pulled me in the 
back again. I knew I wasn't going to be able to fight my eyelids anymore, and I laid my head 
against his chest in defeat, letting them close. I felt the car purr to life. 

"Edward," Rosalie began. 

"I know." Edward's brusque tone was not generous. 

"Bella?" Rosalie asked softly. 

My eyelids fluttered open in shock. It was the first time she'd ever spoken directly to me. 

"Yes, Rosalie?" I asked, hesitant. 

"I'm so very sorry, Bella. I feel wretched about every part of this, and so grateful that you 
were brave enough to go save my brother after what I did. Please say you'll forgive me." 




The words were awkward, stilted because of her embarrassment, but they seemed sincere. 

"Of course, Rosalie," I mumbled, grasping at any chance to make her hate me a little less. 
"It's not your fault at all. I'm the one who jumped off the damn cliff. Of course I forgive you." 

The words came out l ik e mush. 

"It doesn't count until she's conscious, Rose," Emmett chuckled. 

"I'm conscious," I said; it just sounded like a garbled sigh. 

"Let her sleep," Edward insisted, but his voice was a little warmer. 

It was quiet then, except for the gentle thrum of the engine. I must have fallen asleep, 
because it seemed like seconds later when the door opened and Edward was carrying me 
from the car. My eyes wouldn't open. At first I thought we were still at the airport. 

And then I heard Charlie. 

"Bella!" he shouted from some distance. 

"Charlie," I mumbled, trying to shake off the stupor. 

"Shh," Edward whispered. "It's okay; you're home and safe. Just sleep." 

"I can't believe you have the nerve to show your face here." Charlie bellowed at Edward, his 
voice much closer now. 

"Stop it. Dad," I groaned. He didn't hear me. 

"What's wrong with her?" Charlie demanded. 

"She's just very tired, Charlie," Edward assured him quietly. "Please let her rest." 

"Don't tell me what to do!" Charlie yelled. "Give her to me. Get your hands off her!" 

Edward tried to pass me to Charlie, but I clung to him with locked, tenacious fingers. I could 
feel my dad yanking on my arm. 

"Cut it out, Dad," I said with more volume. I managed to drag my lids back to stare at 
Charlie with bleary eyes. "Be mad at me." 

We were in front of my house. The front door was standing open. The cloud cover overhead 
was too thick to guess at a time of day. 

"You bet I will be," Charlie promised. "Get inside." i'"Kay. Let me down," I sighed. 

Edward set me on my feet. I could see that I was upright, but I couldn't feel my legs. I 




trudged forward anyway, until the sidewalk swirled up toward my face. Edward's arms 
caught me before I hit the concrete. 

"Just let me get her upstairs," Edward said. "Then I'll leave." 

"No," I cried, panicking. I hadn't got my answers yet. He had to stay for at least that much, 
didn't he? 

"I won't be far," Edward promised, whispering so low in my ear that Charlie didn't have a 
hope of hearing. 

I didn't hear Charlie answer, but Edward headed into the house. My open eyes only made it 
till the stairs. The last thing I felt was Edward's cool hands prying my fingers loose from his 
shirt. 




23. THE TRUTH 



I HAD THE SENSE THAT I'D BEEN ASLEEP FOR A VERY long time-my body was 
stiff, l ik e I hadn't moved once through all that time, either. My mind was dazed and slow; 
strange, colorful dreams-dreams and nightmares-swirled dizzily around the inside of my 
head. They were so vivid. The horrible and the heavenly, all mixed together into a bizarre 
jumble. There was sharp impatience and fear, both part of that frustrating dream where your 
feet can't move fast enough... And there were plenty of monsters, red-eyed fiends that were 
all the more ghastly for their genteel civility. The dream was still strong-I could even 
remember the names. But the strongest, clearest part of the dream was not the horror. It was 
the angel that was most clear. 

It was hard to let him go and wake up. This dream did not want to be shoved away into the 
vault of dreams I refused to revisit. I struggled with it as my mind became more alert, 
focusing on reality. I couldn't remember what day of the week it was, but I was sure Jacob or 
school or work or something was waiting for me. I inhaled deeply, wondering how to face 
another day. 

Something cold touched my forehead with the softest pressure. 

I squeezed my eyes more tightly shut. I was still dreaming, it seemed, and it felt abnormally 
real. I was so close to waking. . . any second now, and it would be gone. 

But I realized that it felt too real, too real to be good for me. The stone arms I imagined 
wrapped around me were far too substantial. If I let this go any further, I'd be sorry for it 
later. With a resigned sigh, I wrenched back my eyelids to dispel the illusion. 

"Oh!" I gasped, and threw my fists over my eyes. 

Well, clearly, I'd gone too far; it must have been a mistake to let my imagination get so out of 
hand. Okay, so "let" was the wrong word. I'd forced it to get out of hand-pretty much 
stalked my hallucinations-and now my mind had snapped. 

It took less than half a second for me to realize that, as long as I was truly insane now, I 
might as well enjoy the delusions while they were pleasant. 

I opened my eyes again-and Edward was still there, his perfect face just inches away from 
mine. 

"Did I frighten you?" His low voice was anxious. This was very good, as delusions went. The 
face, the voice, the scent, everything-it was so much better than drowning. The beautiful 
figment of my imagination watched my changing expressions, with alarm. His irises were 
pitch-black, with bruise-l ik e shadows under them. This surprised me; my hallucinatory 
Edwards were usually better fed. 

I blinked twice, desperately trying to remember the last thing that I was sure was real. Alice 




was part of my dream, and I wondered if she had really come back at all, or if that was just 
the preamble. I thought she'd returned the day I'd nearly drowned. . . 

"Oh, crap" I croaked. My throat was thick with sleeping. 

"What's wrong, Bella?" 

I frowned at him unhappily. His face was even more anxious than before. 

"I'm dead, right?" I moaned. "I did drown. Crap, crap, crap! This is gonna kill Charlie." 
Edward frowned, too. "You're not dead." 

"Then why am I not waking up?" I challenged, raising my eyebrows. 

"You are awake, Bella." 

I shook my head. "Sure, sure. That's what you want me to think. And then it will be worse 
when I do wake up. If I wake up, which I won't, because I'm dead. This is awful. Poor 
Charlie. And Renee and Jake. . ." I trailed off in horror at what I had done. 

"I can see where you might confuse me with a nightmare." His short-lived smile was grim. 
"But I can't imagine what you could have done to wind up in hell. Did you commit many 
murders while I was away?" 

I grimaced. "Obviously not. If I was in hell, you wouldn't be with me." 

He sighed. 

My head was getting clearer. My eyes flickered away from his face-unwillingly-for one 
second, to the dark, open window, and then back to him. I started to remember details. . . and 
I felt a faint, unfamiliar blush warm the skin over my cheekbones as I slowly realized that 
Edward was really, truly here with me, and I was wasting time being an idiot. 

"Did all of that really happen, then?" It was almost impossible to reassign my dream as 
reality. I couldn't wrap my head around the concept. 

"That depends." Edward's smile was still hard. "If you're referring to us nearly being 
massacred in Italy, then, yes." 

"How strange," I mused. "I really went to Italy. Did you know I'd never been farther east 
than Albuquerque?" 

He rolled his eyes. "Maybe you should go back to sleep. You're not coherent." 



"I'm not tired anymore." It was all coming clear now. "What time is it? How long have I been 
sleeping?" 




"It's just after one in the morning. So, about fourteen hours." 

I stretched as he spoke. I was so stiff. 

"Charlie?" I asked. 

Edward frowned. "Sleeping. You should probably know that I'm breaking the rules right 
now. Well, not technically, since he said I was never to walk through his door again, and I 
came in the window. . . But, still, the intent was clear." 

"Charlie banned you from the house?" I asked, disbelief quickly melting into fury. 

His eyes were sad. "Did you expect anything else?" 

My eyes were mad. I was going to have a few words with my father-perhaps it would be a 
good time to remind h im that I was over the legal age of adulthood. It didn't matter so much, 
of course, except in principle. All too soon there would be no reason for the prohibition. I 
turned my thoughts to less painful avenues. 

"What's the story?" I asked, genuinely curious, but also trying desperately to keep the 
conversation casual, to keep a firm grip on myself, so I wouldn't scare him away with the 
frantic, gnawing craving that was raging inside me. 

"What do you mean?" 

"What am I telling Charlie? What's my excuse for disappearing for. . . how long was I gone, 
anyway?" I tried to count the hours in my head. 

"Just three days." His eyes tightened, but he smiled more naturally this time. "Actually, I was 
hoping you might have a good explanation. I've got nothing." 

I groaned. "Fabulous." 

"Well, maybe Alice will come up with something," he offered, trying to comfort me. 

And I was comforted. Who cared what I had to deal with later? Every second that he was 
here-so close, his flawless face glowing in the dim light from the numbers on my alarm 
clock-was precious and not to be wasted. 

"So," I began, picking the least important-though still vitally interesting-question to start 
with. I was safely delivered home, and he might decide to leave at any moment. I had to keep 
him talking. Besides, this temporary heaven wasn't entirely complete without the sound of 
his voice. "What have you been doing, up until three days ago?" 

His face turned wary in an instant. "Nothing terribly exciting." 

"Of course not," I mumbled. 




'Why are you making that face?’ 



"Well. . I pursed my lips, considering. "If you were, after all, just a dream, that's exactly the 
kind of thing you would say. My imagination must be used up." 

He sighed. "If I tell you, will you finally believe that you're not having a nightmare?" 

"Nightmare!" I repeated scornfully. He waited for my answer. "Maybe," I said after a second 
of thought. "If you tell me." 

"I was... hunting." 

"Is that the best you can do?" I criticized. "That definitely doesn't prove I'm awake." 

He hesitated, and then spoke slowly, choosing his words with care. "I wasn't hunting fot 
food. . . I was actually trying my hand at. . . tracking. I'm not very good at it." 

"What were you tracking?" I asked, intrigued. 

"Nothing of consequence." His words didn't match his expression; he looked upset, 
uncomfortable. 

"I don't understand." 

He hesitated; his face, shining with an odd green cast from the light of the clock, was tom. 

"I-" He took a deep breath. "I owe you an apology. No, of course I owe you much, much 
more than that. But you have to know, "-the words began to flow so fast, the way I 
remembered he spoke sometimes when he was agitated, that I really had to concentrate to 
catch them all-"that I had no idea. I didn't realize the mess I was leaving behind. I thought it 
was safe for you here. So safe. I had no idea that Victoria, "-his lips curled back when he said 
the name-"would come back. I'll admit, when I saw her that one time, I was paying much 
more attention to James's thoughts. But I just didn't see that she had this kind of response in 
her. That she even had such a tie to him. I think I realize why now-she was so sure of him, 
the thought of him failing never occurred to her. It was her overconfidence that clouded her 
feelings about him-that kept me from seeing the depth of them, the bond there. 

"Not that there's any excuse for what I left you to face. When I heard what you told 
Alice-what she saw herself-when I realized that you had to put your life in the hands of 
werewolves , immature, volatile, the worst thing out there besides Victoria herself-he 
shuddered and the gush of words halted for a short second. "Please know that I had no idea 
of any of this. I feel sick, sick to my core, even now, when I can see and feel you safe in my 
arms. I am the most miserable excuse for-" 

"Stop," I interrupted him. He stared at me with agonized eyes, and I tried to find the right 
words-the words that would free h im from this imagined obligation that caused him so much 
pain. They were very hard words to say. I didn't know if I could get them out without 




breaking down. But I had to try to do it right. I didn't want to be a source of guilt and 
anguish in his life. He should be happy, no matter what it cost me. 

I'd really been hoping to put off this part of our last conversation. It was going to bring 
things to an end so much sooner. 

Drawing on all my months of practice with trying to be normal for Charlie, I kept my face 
smooth. 

"Edward," I said. His name burned my throat a little on the way out. I could feel the ghost of 
the hole, waiting to rip itself wide again as soon as he disappeared. I didn't quite see how I 
was going to survive it this time. "This has to stop now. You can't think about things that 
way. You can't let this... this guilt... rule your life. You can't take responsibility for the 
things that happen to me here. None of it is your fault, it's just part of how life is for me. So, 
if I trip in front of a bus or whatever it is next time, you have to realize that it's not your job 
to take the blame. You can't just go running off to Italy because you feel bad that you didn't 
save me. Even if I had jumped off that cliff to die, that would have been my choice, and not 
your fault. I know it's your. . . your nature to shoulder the blame for everything, but you really 
can't let that make you go to such extremes! It's very irresponsible-think of Esme and 
Carlisle and-" 

I was on the edge of losing it. I stopped to take a deep breath, hoping to calm myself. I had 
to set him free. I had to make sure this never happened again. 

"Isabella Marie Swan," he whispered, the strangest expression crossing his face. He almost 
looked mad. "Do you believe that I asked the Volturi to kill me because I felt guilty?' 

I could feel the blank incomprehension on my face. "Didn't you?" 

"Feel guilty? Intensely so. More than you can comprehend." 

"Then. . . what are you saying? I don't understand." 

"Bella, I went to the Volturi because I thought you were dead," he said, voice soft, eyes 
fierce. "Even if I'd had no hand in your death"-he shuddered as he whispered the last 
word-"even if it wasn't my fault, I would have gone to Italy. Obviously, I should have been 
more careful-I should have spoken to Alice directly, rather than accepting it secondhand 
from Rosalie. But, really, what was I supposed to think when the boy said Charlie was at the 
funeral? What are the odds? 

"The odds..." he muttered then, distracted. His voice was so low I wasn't sure I beard it 
right. "The odds are always stacked against us. Mistake after mistake. I'll never criticize 
Romeo again." 

"But I still don't understand," I said. "That's my whole point. So what?" 



'Excuse me?’ 




So what if I was dead?' 



He stared at me dubiously for a long moment before answering. "Don't you remember 
anything I told you before?" 

"I remember everything that you told me." Including the words that had negated all the rest. 

He brushed the tip of his cool finger against my lower lip. "Bella, you seem to be under a 
misapprehension." He closed his eyes, shaking his head back and forth with half a smile on 
his beautiful face. It wasn't a happy smile. "I thought I'd explained it clearly before. Bella, I 
can't live in a world where you don't exist." 

"I am..." My head swam as I looked for the appropriate word. "Confused." That worked. I 
couldn't make sense of what he was saying. 

He stared deep into my eyes with his sincere, earnest gaze. "I'm a good liar, Bella, I have to 
be." 

I froze, my muscles locking down as if for impact. The fault line in my chest rippled; the pain 
of it took my breath away. 

He shook my shoulder, trying to loosen my rigid pose. "Let me finish! I'm a good liar, but 
still, for you to believe me so quickly." He winced. "That was... excruciating." 

I waited, still frozen. 

"When we were in the forest, when I was telling you goodbye-" 

I didn't allow myself to remember. I fought to keep myself in the present second only. 

"You weren't going to let go," he whispered. "I could see that. I didn't want to do it-it felt 
l ik e it would kill me to do it-but I knew that if I couldn't convince you that I didn't love you 
anymore, it would just take you that much longer to get on with your life. I hoped that, if you 
thought I'd moved on, so would you." 

"A clean break," I whispered through unmoving lips. 

"Exactly. But I never imagined it would be so easy to do! I thought it would be next to 
impossible-that you would be so sure of the truth that I would have to he through my teeth 
for hours to even plant the seed of doubt in your head. I lied, and I'm so sorry-sorry because I 
hurt you, sorry because it was a worthless effort. Sorry that I couldn't protect you from what 
I an. I lied to save you, and it didn't work. I'm sorry. 

"But how could you believe me? After all the thousand times I've told you I love you, how 
could you let one word break your faith in me?" 

I didn't answer. I was too shocked to form a rational response. 




"I could see it in your eyes, that you honestly believed that I didn't want you anymore. The 
most absurd, ridiculous concept-as if there were anu way that I could exist without needing 
you\" 

I was still frozen. His words were incomprehensible, because they were impossible. 

He shook my shoulder again, not hard, but enough that my teeth rattled a little. 

"Bella," he sighed. "Really, what were you thinking!" 

And so I started to cry. The tears welled up and then gushed miserably down my cheeks. 

"I knew it," I sobbed. "I knew I was dreaming." 

"You're impossible," he said, and he laughed once-a hard laugh, frustrated. "How can I put 
this so that you'll believe me? You're not asleep, and you're not dead. I'm here, and I love 
you. I have always loved you, and I will always love you. I was thinking of you, seeing your 
face in my mind, every second that I was away. When I told you that I didn't want you, it 
was the very blackest kind of blasphemy." 

I shook my head while the tears continued to ooze from the corners of my eyes. 

"You don't believe me, do you?" he whispered, his face paler than his usual pale-I could see 
that even in the dim light. "Why can you believe the lie, but not the truth?" 

"It never made sense for you to love me," I explained, my voice breaking twice. "I always 
knew that." 

His eyes narrowed, his jaw tightened. 

"I'll prove you're awake," he promised. 

He caught my face securely between his iron hands, ignoring my struggles when I tried to 
turn my head away. 

"Please don't," I whispered. 

He stopped, his lips just half an inch from mine. 

"Why not?" he demanded. His breath blew into my face, making my head whirl. 

"When I wake up"-He opened his mouth to protest, so I revised-"okay, forget that 
one-when you leave again, it's going to be hard enough without this, too." 

He pulled back an inch, to stare at my face. 

"Yesterday, when I would touch you, you were so... hesitant, so careful, and yet still the 
same. I need to know why. Is it because I'm too late? Because I've hurt you too much? 




Because you have moved on, as I meant for you to? That would be... quite fair. I won't 
contest your decision. So don't try to spare my feelings, please-just tell me now whether or 
not you can still love me, after everything I've done to you. Can you?" he whispered. 

"What kind of an idiotic question is that?" 

"Just answer it. Please." 

I stared at h im darkly for a long moment. "The way I feel about you will never change. Of 
course I love you-and there's nothing you can do about it!" 

"That's all I needed to hear." 

His mouth was on mine then, and I couldn't fight him. Not because he was so many 
thousand times stronger than me, but because my will crumbled into dust the second our lips 
met. This kiss was not quite as careful as others I remembered, which suited me just fine. If I 
was going to rip myself up further, I might as well get as much in trade as possible. 

So I kissed him back, my heart pounding out a jagged, disjointed rhythm while my breathing 
turned to panting and my fingers moved greedily to his face. I could feel his marble body 
against every line of mine, and I was so glad he hadn't listened to me-there was no pain in 
the world that would have justified missing this. His hands memorized my face, the same 
way mine were tracing his, and, in the brief seconds when his lips were free, he whispered 
my name. 

When I was starting to get dizzy, he pulled away, only to lay his ear against my heart. 

I lay there, dazed, waiting for my gasping to slow and quiet. 

"By the way," he said in a casual tone. "I'm not leaving you." 

I didn't say anything, and he seemed to hear skepticism in my silence. 

He lifted his face to lock my gaze in his. "I'm not going anywhere. Not without you," he 
added more seriously. 

"I only left you in the first place because I wanted you to have a chance at a normal, happy, 
human life. I could see what I was doing to you-keeping you constantly on the edge of 
danger, taking you away from the world you belonged in, risking your life every moment I 
was with you. So I had to try. I had to do something , and it seemed l ik e leaving was the only 
way. If I hadn't thought you would be better off, I could have never made myself leave. I'm 
much too selfish. Only you could be more important than what I wanted... what I needed. 
What I want and need is to be with you, and I know I'll never be strong enough to leave 
again. I have too many excuses to stay-thank heaven for that! It seems you can't be safe, no 
matter how many miles I put between us." 



Don't promise me anything," I whispered. If I let myself hope, and it came to nothing. . . that 




would kill me. Where all those merciless vampires had not been able to finish me off, hope 
would do the job. 

Anger glinted metallic in his black eyes. "You think I'm lying to you now?" 

"No-not lying." I shook my head, trying to think it through coherently. To examine the 
hypothesis that he did love me, while staying objective, clinical, so I wouldn't fall into the 
trap of hoping. "You could mean it... now. But what about tomorrow, when you think about 
all the reasons you left in the first place? Or next month, when Jasper takes a snap at me?" 

He flinched. 

I thought back over those last days of my life before he left me, tried to see them through the 
filter of what he was telling me now. From that perspective, imagining that he'd left me 
while loving me, left me for me, his brooding and cold silences took on a different meaning. 
"It isn't as if you hadn't thought the first decision through, is it?" I guessed. "You'll end up 
doing what you think is right." 

"I'm not as strong as you give me credit for," he said. "Right and wrong have ceased to mean 
much to me; I was coming back anyway. Before Rosalie told me the news, I was already past 
trying to live through one week at a time, or even one day. I was fighting to make it through 
a single hour. It was only a matter of time-and not much of it-before I showed up at your 
window and begged you to take me back. I'd be happy to beg now, if you'd like that." 

I grimaced. "Be serious, please." 

"Oh, I am," he insisted, glaring now. "Will you please try to hear what I'm telling you? Will 
you let me attempt to explain what you mean to me?" 

He waited, studying my face as he spoke to make sure I was really listening. 

"Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars-points 
of light and reason... And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything 
was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor 
had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were 
blinded by the light. I couldn't see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason for 
anything." 

I wanted to believe him. But this was my life without him that he was describing, not the 
other way around. 

"Your eyes will adjust," I mumbled. 

"That's just the problem-they can't." 

"What about your distractions?" 




He laughed without a trace of humor. "Just part of the lie, love. There was no distraction 
from the... the agony. My heart hasn't beat in almost ninety years, but this was different. It 
was like my heart was gone-like I was hollow. Like I'd left everything that was inside me 
here with you." 

"That's funny," I muttered. 

He arched one perfect eyebrow. "Funny? " 

"I meant strange-I thought it was just me. Lots of pieces of me went missing, too. I haven't 
been able to really breathe in so long." I filled my lungs, luxuriating in the sensation. "And my 
heart. That was definitely lost." 

He closed his eyes and laid his ear over my heart again. I let my cheek press against his hair, 
felt the texture of it on my skin, smelled the delicious scent of him. 

"Tracking wasn't a distraction then?" I asked, curious, and also needing to distract myself. I 
was very much in danger of hoping. I wouldn't be able to stop myself for long. My heart 
throbbed, singing in my chest. 

"No." He sighed. "That was never a distraction. It was an obligation." 

"What does that mean?" 

"It means that, even though I never expected any danger from Victoria, I wasn't going to let 
her get away with... Well, l ik e I said, I was horrible at it. I traced her as far as Texas, but 
then I followed a false lead down to Brazil-and really she came here." He groaned. "I wasn't 
even on the right continent! And all the while, worse than my worst fears-" 

"You were hunting Victoria ?" I half-shrieked as soon as I could find my voice, shooting 
through two octaves. 

Charlie's distant snores stuttered, and then picked up a regular rhythm again. 

"Not well," Edward answered, studying my outraged expression with a confused look. "But 
I'll do better this time. She won't be tainting perfectly good air by breathing in and out for 
much longer." 

"That is... out of the question," I managed to choke out. Insanity. Even if he had Emmett or 
Jasper help him. Even if he had Emmett and Jasper help. It was worse than my other 
imaginings: Jacob Black standing across a small space from Victoria's vicious and feline 
figure. I couldn't bear to picture Edward there, even though he was so much more durable 
than my half-human best friend. 

"It's too late for her. I might have let the other time slide, but not now, not after-" 



I interrupted him again, trying to sound calm. "Didn't you just promise that you weren't going 




to leave?" I asked, fighting the words as I said them, nor letting them plant themselves in my 
heart. "That isn't exactly compatible with an extended tracking expedition, is it?" 

He frowned. A snarl began to build low in his chest. "I will keep my promise, Bella. But 
Victoria"-the snarl became more pronounced-"is going to die. Soon." 

"Let's not be hasty," I said, trying to hide my panic. "Maybe she's not coming back. Jake's 
pack probably scared her off. There's really no reason to go looking for her. Besides, I've got 
bigger problems than Victoria." 

Edward's eyes narrowed, but he nodded. "It's true. The werewolves are a problem." 

I snorted. "I wasn't talking about Jacob. My problems are a lot worse that a handful of 
adolescent wolves getting themselves into trouble." 

Edward looked as if he were about to say something, and then thought better of it. His teeth 
clicked together, and he spoke through them. "Really?" he asked. "Then what would be your 
greatest problem? That would make Victoria's returning for you seem l ik e such an 
inconsequential matter in comparison?" 

"How about the second greatest?" I hedged. 

"All right," he agreed, suspicious. 

I paused. I wasn't sure I could say the name. "There are others who are coming to look for 
me," I reminded him in a subdued whisper. 

He sighed, but the reaction was not as strong as I would have imagined after his response to 
Victoria. 

"The Volturi are only the second greatest?" 

"You don't seem that upset about it," I noted. 

"Well, we have plenty of time to think it through. Time means something very different to 
them than it does to you, or even me. They count years the way you count days. I wouldn't 
be surprised if you were thirty before you crossed their minds again," he added lightly. 

Horror washed through me. 

Thirty. 

So his promises meant nothing, in the end. If I were going to turn thirty someday, then he 
couldn't be planning on staying long. The harsh pain of this knowledge made me realize that 
I'd already begun to hope, without giving myself permission to do 5.0. 



"You don't have to be afraid," he said, anxious as he watched the tears dew up again on the 
rims of my eyes. "I won't let them hurt you." 




'While you're here." Not that I cared what happened to me when he left. 



He took my face between his two stone hands, holding it tightly while his midnight eyes 
glared into mine with the gravitational force of a black hole. "I will never leave you again." 

"But you said thirty ," I whispered. The tears leaked over the edge. "What? You're going to 
stay, but let me get all old anyway? Right." 

His eyes softened, while his mouth went hard. "That's exactly what I'm going to do. What 
choice have I? I cannot be without you, but I will not destroy your soul." 

"Is this really. . ." I tried to keep my voice even, but this question was too hard. I remembered 
his face when Aro had almost begged him to consider making me immortal. The sick look 
there. Was this fixation with keeping me human really about my soul, or was it because he 
wasn't sure that he wanted me around that long? 

"Yes?" he asked, waiting for my question. 

I asked a different one. Almost-but not quite-as hard. 

"But what about when I get so old that people think I'm your mother? Your grandmother ?" 
My voice was pale with revulsion-I could see Gran's face again in the dream mirror. 

His whole face was soft now. He brushed the tears from my cheek with his lips. "That 
doesn't mean anything to me," he breathed against my s ki n. "You will always be the most 
beautiful thing in my world. Of course..." He hesitated, flinching slightly. "If you outgrew 
me - if you wanted something more-I would understand that, Bella. I promise I wouldn't 
stand in your way if you wanted to leave me." 

His eyes were liquid onyx and utterly sincere. He spoke as if he'd put endless amounts of 
thought into this asinine plan. 

"You do reali z e that I'll die eventually, right?" I demanded. 

He'd thought about this part, too. "I'll follow after as soon as I can." 

"That is seriously. . ."I looked for the right word. "Sick." 

"Bella, it's the only right way left-" 

"Let's just back up for a minute," I said; feeling angry made it so much easier to be clear, 
decisive. "You do remember the Volturi, right? I can't stay human forever. They'll kill me. 
Even if they don't think of me till I'm thirty "- 1 hissed the word-"do you really think they'll 
forget?" 

"No," he answered slowly, shaking his head. "They won't forget. But..." 




But? 



He grinned while I stared at him warily. Maybe I wasn't the only crazy one. 

"I have a few plans." 

"And these plans," I said, my voice getting more acidic with each word. "These plans all 
center around me staying human." 

My attitude hardened his expression. "Naturally." His tone was brusque, his divine face 
arrogant. 

We glowered at each other for a long minute. 

Then I took a deep breath, squared my shoulders, I pushed his arms away so that I could sit 
up. 

"Do you want me to leave?" he asked, and it made my heart flutter to see that this idea hurt 
him, though he tried not to show it. 

"No," I told him. " I'm leaving." 

He watched me suspiciously as I climbed out of the bed and fumbled around in the dark 
room, looking for my shoes. 

"May I ask where you are going."’ he asked. 

"I'm going to your house," I told him, still feeling around blindly. 

He got up and came to my side. "Here are your shoes. How did you plan to get there?" 

"My truck." 

"That will probably wake Charlie," he offered as a deterrent. 

I sighed. "I know. But honestly, I'll be grounded for weeks as it is. How much more trouble 
can I really get in?" 

"None. He'll blame me, not you." 

"If you have a better idea, I'm all ears." 

"Stay here," he suggested, but his expression wasn't hopeful. 

"No dice. But you go ahead and make yourself at home," I encouraged, surprised at how 
natural my teasing sounded, and headed for the door. 

He was there before me, blocking my way. 




I frowned, and turned for the window. It wasn't really that far to the ground, and it was 
mostly grass beneath. . . 

"Okay," he sighed. "I'll give you a ride." 

I shrugged. "Either way. But you probably should be there, too." 

"And why is that?" 

"Because you're extraordinarily opinionated, and I'm sure you'll want a chance to air your 
views." 

"My views on which subject?" He asked through his teeth. 

"This isn't just about you anymore. You're not the center of the universe, you know." My 
own personal universe was, of course, a different story. "If you're going to bring the Volturi 
down on us over something as stupid as leaving me human, then your family ought to have a 
say." 

"A say in what?" he asked, each word distinct. 

"My mortality. I'm putting it to a vote." 




24. VOTE 



HE WAS NOT PLEASED, THAT MUCH WAS EASY TO READ in his face. But, 
without further argument, he took me in his arms and sprang lithely from my window, 
landing without the slightest jolt, like a cat. It was a little bit farther down than I'd imagined. 

"All right then," he said, his voice seething with disapproval. "Up you go." 

He helped me onto his back, and took off running. Even after all this time, it felt routine. 
Easy. Evidently this was something you never forgot, l ik e riding a bicycle. 

It was so very quiet and dark as he ran through the forest, his breathing slow and even-dark 
enough that the trees flying past us were nearly invisible, and only the rush of air in my face 
truly gave away our speed. The air was damp; it didn't burn my eyes the way the wind in the 
big plaza had, and that was comforting. As was the night, too, after that terrifying brightness. 
Like the thick quilt I'd played under as a child, the dark felt familiar and protecting. 

I remembered that running through the forest like this used to frighten me, that I used to 
have to close my eyes. It seemed a silly reaction to me now. I kept my eyes wide, my chin 
resting on his shoulder, my cheek against his neck. The speed was exhilarating. A hundred 
times better than the motorcycle. 

I turned my face toward him and pressed my lips into the cold stone skin of his neck. 

"Thank you," he said, as the vague, black shapes of trees raced past us. "Does that mean 
you've decided you're awake?" 

I laughed. The sound was easy, natural, effortless. It sounded right. "Not really. More that, 
either way, I'm not trying to wake up. Not tonight." 

"I'll earn your trust back somehow," he murmured, mostly to himself. "If it's my final act." 

"I trust you," I assured him. "It's me I don't trust." 

"Explain that, please." 

He'd slowed to a walk-I could only tell because the wind ceased-and I guessed that we 
weren't far from the house. In fact, I thought I could make out the sound of the river rushing 
somewhere close by in the darkness. 

"Well-" I struggled to find the right way to phrase it. "I don't trust myself to be... enough. 
To deserve you. There's nothing about me that could hold you." 

He stopped and reached around to pull me from his back. His gentle hands did not release 
me; after he'd set me on my feet again, he wrapped his arms tightly around me, hugging me 
to his chest. 




"Your hold is permanent and unbreakable," he whispered. "Never doubt that. 
But how could I not? 



"You never did tell me. . ." he murmured. 

"What?" 

"What your greatest problem is." 

"I'll give you one guess." I sighed, and reached up to touch the tip of his nose with my index 
finger. 

He nodded. "I'm worse than the Volturi," he said grimly. "I guess I've earned that." 

I rolled my eyes. "The worst the Volturi can do is kill me." 

He waited with tense eyes. 

"You can leave me," I explained. "The Volturi, Victoria... they're nothing compared to that." 

Even in the darkness, I could see the anguish twist his face-it reminded me of his expression 
under Jane's torturing gaze; I felt sick, and regretted speaking the truth. 

"Don't," I whispered, touching his face. "Don't be sad." 

He pulled one comer of his mouth up halfheartedly, but the expression didn't touch his eyes. 
"If there was only some way to make you see that I can't leave you," he whispered. "Time, I 
suppose, will be the way to convince you." 

I l ik ed the idea of time. "Okay," I agreed. 

His face was still tormented. I tried to distract him with inconsequentials. 

"So-since you're staying. Can I have my stuff back?" I asked, making my tone as light as I 
could manage. 

My attempt worked, to an extent: he laughed. But his eyes retained the misery. "Your things 
were never gone," he told me. "I knew it was wrong, since I promised you peace without 
reminders. It was stupid and childish, but I wanted to leave something of myself with you. 
The CD, the pictures, the tickets-they're all under your floorboards." 

"Really?" 

He nodded, seeming slightly cheered by my obvious pleasure in this trivial fact. It wasn't 
enough to heal the pain in his face completely. 



'I think," I said slowly, "I'm not sure, but I wonder... I think maybe I knew it the whole 




time. 



"What did you know?" 

I only wanted to take away the agony in his eyes, but as I spoke the words, they sounded 
truer than I expected they would. 

"Some part of me, my subconscious maybe, never stopped believing that you still cared 
whether I lived or died. That's probably why I was hearing the voices." 

There was a very deep silence for a moment. "Voices?" he asked flatly. 

"Well, just one voice. Yours. It's a long story." The wary look on his face made me wish that 
I hadn't brought that up. Would he think I was crazy, like everyone else? Was everyone else 
right about that? But at least that expression-the one that made him look like something was 
burning him-faded. 

"I've got time." His voice was unnaturally even. 

"It's pretty pathetic." 

He waited. 

I wasn't sure how to explain. "Do you remember what Alice said about extreme sports?" 

He spoke the words without inflection or emphasis. "You jumped off a cliff for fun." 

"Er, right. And before that, with the motorcycle-" 

"Motorcycle?" he asked. I knew his voice well enough to hear something brewing behind the 
calm. 

"I guess I didn't tell Alice about that part." 

"No." 

"Well, about that. . . See, I found that. . . when I was doing something dangerous or stupid. . . I 
could remember you more clearly," I confessed, feeling completely mental. "I could remember 
how your voice sounded when you were angry. I could hear it, l ik e you were standing right 
there next to me. Mostly I tried not to think about you, but this didn't hurt so much-it was 
l ik e you were protecting me again. Like you didn't want me to be hurt. 

"And, well, I wonder if the reason I could hear you so clearly was because, underneath it all. I 
always knew that you hadn't stopped loving me." 

Again, as I spoke, the words brought with them a sense of conviction. Of rightness. Some 
deep place inside me recognized truth. 




His words came out half- strangled. "You. . . were. . . risking your life. . . to hear-" 

"Shh," I interrupted him. "Hold on a second. I think I'm having an epiphany here." 

I thought of that night in Port Angeles when I'd had my first delusion. I'd come up with two 
options. Insanity or wish fulfillment. I'd seen no third option. 

But what if... 

What if you sincerely believed something was true, but you were dead wrong? What if you 
were so stubbornly sure that you were right, that you wouldn't even consider the truth? 
Would the truth be silenced, or would it try to break through? 

Option three: Edward loved me. The bond forged between us was not one that could be 
broken by absence, distance, or time. And no matter how much more special or beautiful or 
brilliant or perfect than me he might be, he was as irreversibly altered as I was. As I would 
always belong to him, so would he always be mine. 

Was that what I'd been trying to tell myself? 

"Oh!" 

"Bella?" 

"Oh. Okay. I see." 

"Your epiphany?" he asked, his voice uneven and strained. 

"You love me," I marveled. The sense of conviction and Tightness washed through me again. 

Though his eyes were still anxious, the crooked smile I loved best flashed across his face. 
"Truly, I do." 

My heart inflated l ik e it was going to crack right through my ribs. It filled my chest and 
blocked my throat so that I could not speak. 

He really did want me the way I wanted him-forever. It was only fear for my soul, for the 
human things he didn't want to take from me, that made him so desperate to leave me 
mortal. Compared to the fear that he didn't want me, this hurdle-my soul-seemed almost 
insignificant. 

He took my face tightly between his cool hands and kissed me until I was so dizzy the forest 
was spinning. Then he leaned his forehead against mine, and I was not the only one 
breathing harder than usual. 

"You were better at it than I was, you know," he told me. 



Better at what? 




"Surviving. You, at least, made an effort. You got up in the morning, tried to be normal for 
Charlie, followed the pattern of your life. When I wasn't actively tracking, I was... totally 
useless. I couldn't be around my family-I couldn't be around anyone. I'm embarrassed to 
admit that I more or less curled up into a ball and let the misery have me." He grinned, 
sheepish. "It was much more pathetic than hearing voices. And, of course, you know I do 
that, too." 

I was deeply relieved that he really seemed to understand-comforted that this all made sense 
to him. At any rate, he wasn't looking at me l ik e I was crazy. He was looking at me like. . . he 
loved me. 

"I only heard one voice," I corrected him. 

He laughed and then pulled me tight against his right side and started to lead me forward. 

"I'm just humoring you with this." He motioned broadly with his hand toward the darkness in 
front of us as we walked. There was something pale and immense there-the house, I realized. 
"It doesn't matter in the slightest what they say." 

"This affects them now, too." 

He shrugged indifferently. 

He led me through the open front door into the dark house and flipped the lights on. The 
room was just as I'd remembered it-the piano and the white couches and the pale, massive 
staircase. No dust, no white sheets. 

Edward called out the names with no more volume than I'd use in regular conversation. 
"Carlisle? Esme? Rosalie? Emmett? Jasper? Alice?" They would hear. 

Carlisle was suddenly standing beside me, as if he'd been there all along. "Welcome back, 
Bella." He smiled. "What can we do for you this morning? I imagine, due to the hour, that 
this is not a purely social visit?" 

I nodded. "I'd like to talk to everyone at once, if that's okay. About something important." 

I couldn't help glancing up at Edward's face as I spoke. His expression was critical, but 
resigned. When I looked back to Carlisle, he was looking at Edward, too. 

"Of course," Carlisle said. "Why don't we talk in the other room?" 

Carlisle led the way through the bright living room, around the comer to the dining room, 
turning on lights as he went. The walls were white, the ceilings high, like the living room. In 
the center of the room, under the low-hanging chandelier, was a large, polished oval table 
surrounded by eight chairs. Carlisle held out a chair for me at the head. 



I'd never seen the Cullens use the dining room table before-it was just a prop. They didn't eat 




in the house. 



As soon as I turned to sit in the chair, I saw that we were not alone. Esme had followed 
Edward, and behind her the rest of the family filed in. 

Carlisle sat down on my right, and Edward on my left. Everyone else took their seats in 
silence. Alice was grinning at me, already in on the plot. Emmett and Jasper looked curious, 
and Rosalie smiled at me tentatively. My answering smile was just as timid. That was going 
to take some getting used to. 

Carlisle nodded toward me. "The floor is yours." 

I swallowed. Their gazing eyes made me nervous. Edward took my hand under the table. I 
peeked at him, but he was watching the others, his fate suddenly fierce. 

"Well," I paused. "I'm hoping Alice has already told you everything that happened in 
Volterra?" 

"Everything," Alice assured me. 

I threw her a meaningful look. "And on the way?" 

"That, too," she nodded. 

"Good," I sighed with relief. "Then we're all on the same page." 

They waited patiently while I tried to order my thoughts. 

"So, I have a problem," I began. "Alice promised the Volturi that I would become one of you. 
They're going to send someone to check, and I'm sure that's a bad thing-something to avoid. 

"And so, now, this involves you all. I'm sorry about that." I looked at each one of their 
beautiful faces, saving the most beautiful for last. Edward's mouth was turned down into a 
grimace. "But, if you don't want me, then I'm not going to force myself on you, whether 
Alice is willing or not." 

Esme opened her mouth to speak, but I held up one finger to stop her. 

"Please, let me finish. You all know what I want. And I'm sure you know what Edward 
thinks, too. I think the only fair way to decide is for everyone to have a vote. If you decide 
you don't want me, then. . . I guess I'll go back to Italy alone. I can't have them coming here." 
My forehead creased as I considered that. 

There was the faint rumble of a growl in Edward's chest. I ignored h im . 

"Taking into account, then, that I won't put any of you in danger either way, I want you to 
vote yes or no on the issue of me becoming a vampire." 




I half-smiled on the last word, and gestured toward Carlisle to begin. 

"Just a minute," Edward interrupted. 

I glared at him through narrowed eyes. He raised his eyebrows at me, squeezing my hand. 

"I have something to add before we vote." 

I sighed. 

"About the danger Bella's referring to," he continued. "I don't think we need to be overly 
anxious." 

His expression became more animated. He put his free hand on the shining table and leaned 
forward. 

"You see," he explained, looking around the table while he spoke, "there was more than one 
reason why I didn't want to shake Aro's hand there at the end. There's something they didn't 
think of, and I didn't want to cine them in." He grinned. 

"Which was?" Alice prodded. I was sure my expression was just as skeptical as hers. 

"The Volturi are overconfident, and with good reason. When they decide to find someone, 
it's not really a problem. Do you remember Demetri?" He glanced down at me. 

I shuddered. He took that as a yes. 

"He finds people-that's his talent, why they keep him. 

"Now, the whole time we were with any of them, I was picking their brains for anything that 
might save us, getting as much information as possible. So I saw how Demetri's talent 
works. He's a tracker-a tracker a thousand times more gifted than Jarres was. His ability is 
loosely related to what I do, or what Aro does. He catches the. . . flavor? I don't know how to 
describe it... the tenor... of someone's mind, and then he follows that. It works over 
immense distances. 

"But after Aro's little experiments, well..." Edward shrugged. 

"You think he won't be able to find me," I said flatly. 

He was smug. "I'm sure of it. He relies totally on that other sense. When it doesn't work with 
you, they'll all be blind." 

"And how does that solve anything?" 

"Quite obviously, Alice will be able to tell when they're planning a visit, and I'll hide you. 
They'll be helpless," he said with fierce enjoyment. "It will be l ik e looking for a piece of straw 
in a haystack!" 




He and Emmett exchanged a glance and a smirk. 

This made no sense. "But they can find you," I reminded h im . 

"And I can take care of myself." 

Emmett laughed, and reached across the table toward his brother, extending a fist. 

"Excellent plan, my brother," he said with enthusiasm. 

Edward stretched out his arm to smack Emmett's fist with his own. 

"No," Rosalie hissed. 

"Absolutely not," I agreed. 

"Nice." Jasper's voice was appreciative. 

"Idiots," Alice muttered. 

Esme just glared at Edward. 

I straightened up in my chair, focusing. This was my meeting. 

"All right, then. Edward has offered an alternative for you to consider," I said coolly. "Let's 
vote." 

I looked toward Edward this time; it would be better to get his opinion out of the way. "Do 
you want me to join your family?" 

His eyes were hard and black as flint. "Not that way. You're staying human." 

I nodded once, keeping my face businesslike, and then moved on. 

"Alice?" 

"Yes." 

"Jasper?" 

"Yes," he said, voice grave. I was a little surprised-I hadn't been at all sure of his vote-but I 
suppressed my reaction and moved on. 

"Rosalie?" 

She hesitated, biting down on her full, perfect bottom lip. "No." 

I kept my face blank and turned my head slightly to move on, but she held up both her hands, 
palms forward. 




"Let me explain," she pleaded. "I don't mean that I have any aversion to you as a sister. It's 
just that. . . this is not the life I would have chosen for myself. I wish there had been someone 
there to vote no for me." 

I nodded slowly, and then turned to Emmett. 

"Hell, yes!" He grinned. "We can find some other way to pick a fight with this Demetri." 

I was still grimacing at that when I looked at Esme. 

"Yes, of course, Bella. I already think of you as part of my family." 

"Thank you, Esme," I murmured as I turned toward Carlisle. 

I was suddenly nervous, wishing I had asked for his vote first. I was sure that this was the 
vote that mattered most, the vote that counted more than any majority. 

Carlisle wasn't looking at me. 

"Edward," he said. 

"No," Edward growled. His jaw was strained tight, his lips curled back from his teeth. 

"It's the only way that makes sense," Carlisle insisted. "You've chosen not to live without 
her, and that doesn't leave me a choice." 

Edward dropped my hand, shoving away from the table. He stalked out of the room, snarling 
under his breath. 

"I guess you know my vote." Carlisle sighed. 

I was still staring after Edward. "Thanks," I mumbled. 

An earsplitting crash echoed from the other room. 

I flinched, and spoke quickly. "That's all I needed. Thank you. For wanting to keep me. I feel 
exactly the same way about all of you, too." My voice was jagged with emotion by the end. 

Esme was at my side in a flash, her cold arms around me. 

"Dearest Bella," she breathed. 

I hugged her back. Out of the comer of my eye, I noticed Rosalie looking down at the table, 
and I realized that my words could be construed in two ways. 

"Well, Alice," I said when Esme released me. "Where do you want to do this?" 

Alice stared at me, her eyes widening with terror. 




"No! No! NO!" Edward roared, charging back into the room. He was in my face before I had 
time to blink, bending over me, his expression twisted in rage. "Are you insane?" he shouted. 
"Have you utterly lost your mind?" 

I cringed away, my hands over my ears. 

"Um, Bella," Alice interjected in an anxious voice. "I don't think I'm ready for that. I'll need 
to prepare..." 

"You promised," I reminded her, glaring under Edward's arm. 

"I know, but. . . Seriously, Bella! I don't have any idea how to not kill you." 

"You can do it," I encouraged. "I trust you." 

Edward snarled in fury. 

Alice shook her head quickly, looking panicked. 

"Carlisle?" I turned to look at him. 

Edward grabbed my face in his hand, forcing me to look at him. His other hand was out, 
palm toward Carlisle. 

Carlisle ignored that. "I'm able to do it," he answered my question. I wished I could see his 
expression. "You would be in no danger of me losing control." 

"Sounds good." I hoped he could understand; it was hard to talk clearly the way Edward held 
my jaw. 

"Hold on," Edward said between his teeth. "It doesn't have to be now." 

"There's no reason for it not to be now," I said, the words coming out distorted. 

"I can think of a few." 

"Of course you can," I said sourly. "Now let go of me." 

He freed my face, and folded his arms across his chest. "In about two hours, Charlie will be 
here looking for you. I wouldn't put it past h im to involve the police." 

"All three of them." But I frowned. 

This was always the hardest part. Charlie, Renee. Now Jacob, too. The people I would lose, 
the people I would hurt. I wished there was some way that I could be the only one to suffer, 
but I knew that was impossible. 

At the same time, I was hurting them more by staying human. Putting Charlie in constant 




danger through my proximity. Putting Jake in worse danger still by drawing his enemies 
across the land he felt bound to protect. And Renee-I couldn't even risk a visit to see my 
own mother for fear of bringing my deadly problems along with me! 

I was a danger magnet; I'd accepted that about myself. 

Accepting this, I knew I needed to be able to take care of myself and protect the ones I 
loved, even if that meant that I couldn't be with them. I needed to be strong. 

"In the interest of remaining inconspicuous ," Edward said, still talking through his gritted 
teeth, but looking at Carlisle now, "I suggest that we put this conversation off, at the very 
least until Bella finishes high school, and moves out of Charlie's house." 

"That's a reasonable request, Bella," Carlisle pointed out. 

I thought about Charlie's reaction when he woke up this morning, if-after all that life had put 
him through in the last week with Harry's loss, and then I had put him through with my 
unexplained disappearance-he were to find my bed empty. Charlie deserved better than that. 
It was just a little more time; graduation wasn't so far away . . . 

I pursed my lips. "I'll consider it." 

Edward relaxed. His jaw unclenched. 

"I should probably take you home," he said, more calm now, but clearly in a hurry to get me 
out of here. "Just in case Charlie wakes up early." 

I looked at Carlisle. "After graduation?" 

"You have my word." 

I took a deep breath, smiled, and turned back to Edward. "Okay. You can take me home." 

Edward rushed me out of the house before Carlisle could promise me anything else. He took 
me out the back, so I didn't get to see what was broken in the living room. 

It was a quiet trip home. I was feeling triumphant, and a little smug. Scared stiff, too, of 
course, but I tried not to think about that part. It did me no good to worry about the pain-the 
physical or the emotional-so I wouldn't. Not until I absolutely had to. 

When we got to my house, Edward didn't pause. He dashed up the wall and through my 
window in half a second. Then he pulled my arms frcm around his neck and set me on the 
bed. 

I thought I had a pretty good idea of what he was thinking, but his expression surprised me. 
Instead of furious, it was calculating. He paced silently back and forth across my dark room 
while I watched with growing suspicion. 




"Whatever you're planning, it's not going to work," I told him. 

"Shh. I'm thinking." 

"Ugh," I groaned, throwing myself back on the bed and pulling the quilt over my head. 

There was no sound, but suddenly he was there. He flipped the cover back so he could see 
me. He was lying next to me. His hand reached up to brush my hair from my cheek. 

"If you don't mind, I'd much rather you didn't hide your face. I've lived without it for as long 
as I can stand. Now. . . tell me something." 

"What?" I asked, unwilling. 

"If you could have anything in the world, anything at all, what would it be?" 

I could feel the skepticism in my eyes. "You." 

He shook his head impatiently. "Something you don't already have." 

I wasn't sure where he was trying to lead me, so I thought carefully before I answered. I came 
up with something that was both true, and also probably impossible. 

"I would want. . . Carlisle not to have to do it. I would want you to change me." 

I watched his reaction warily, expecting more of the fury I'd seen at his house. I was 
surprised that his expression didn't change. It was still calculating, thoughtful. 

"What would you be willing to trade for that?" 

I couldn't believe my ears. I gawked at his composed face and blurted out the answer before I 
could think about it. 

"Anything." 

He smiled faintly, and then pursed his lips. "Five years?" 

My face twisted into an expression somewhere between chagrin and horror. 

"You said anything," he reminded me. 

"Yes, but... you'll use the time to find a way out of it. I have to strike while the iron is hot. 
Besides, it's just too dangerous to be human-for me, at least. So, anything but that." 

He frowned. "Three years?" 

"No!" 



Isn't it worth anyrhing to you at all? 




I thought about how much I wanted this. Better to keep a poker face, I decided, and not let 
him know how very much that was. It would give me more leverage. "Six months?" 

He rolled his eyes. "Not good enough." 

"One year, then," I said. "That's my limit." 

"At least give me two." 

"No way. Nineteen I'll do. But I'm not going anywhere near twenty. If you're staying in your 
teens forever, then so am I." 

He thought for a minute. "All right. Forget time limits. If you want me to be the one-then 
you'll just have to meet one condition." 

"Condition?" My voice went flat. "What condition?" 

His eyes were cautious-he spoke slowly. "Marry me first." 

I stared at him, waiting. . . "Okay. What's the punch line?" 

He sighed. "You're wounding my ego, Bella. I just proposed to you, and you think it's a 
joke." 

"Edward, please be serious." 

"I am one hundred percent serious." He gazed at me with no hint of humor in his face. 

"Oh, c'mon," I said, an edge of hysteria in my voice. "I'm only eighteen." 

"Well, I'm nearly a hundred and ten. It's time I settled down." 

I looked away, out the dark window, trying to control the panic before it gave me away. 

"Look, marriage isn't exactly that high on my list of priorities, you know? It was sort of the 
kiss of death for Renee and Charlie." 

"Interesting choice of words." 

"You know what I mean." 

He inhaled deeply. "Please don't tell me that you're afraid of the commitment," his voice was 
disbelieving, and I understood what he meant. 

"That's not it exactly," I hedged. "I'm... afraid of Renee. She has some really intense opinions 
on getting married before you're thirty." 

"Because she'd rather you became one of the eternal damned than get married." He laughed 




darkly. 

"You think you're joking." 

"Bella, if you compare the level of commitment between a marital union as opposed to 
bartering your soul in exchange for an eternity as a vampire..." He shook his head. "If you're 
not brave enough to marry me, then-" 

"Well," I interrupted. "What if I did? What if I told you to take me to Vegas now? Would I 
be a vampire in three days?" 

He smiled, his teeth flashing in the dark. "Sure," he said, calling my bluff. "I'll get my car." 
"Dammit." I muttered. "I'll give you eighteen months." 

"No deal," he said, grinning. "I l ik e this condition." 

"Fine. I'll have Carlisle do it when I graduate." 

"If that's what you really want." He shrugged, and his smile became absolutely angelic. 
"You're impossible," I groaned. "A monster." 

He chuckled. "Is that why you won't marry me?" 

I groaned again. 

He leaned toward me; his night-dark eyes melted and smoldered and shattered my 
concentration. " Please , Bella?" he breathed. 

I forgot how to breathe for a moment. When I recovered, I shook my head quickly, trying to 
clear my suddenly clouded mind. 

"Would this have gone better if I d had time to get a ring.'" 

"No! No rings!" I very nearly snouted. 

"Now you've done it," he whispered. 

"Oops." 

"Charlie's getting up; I'd better leave," Edward said with resignation. 

My heart stopped beating. 

He gauged my expression for a second. "Would it be childish of me to hide in your closet, 
then?" 

"No," I whispered eagerly. "Stay. Please." 




Edward smiled and disappeared. 



I seethed in the darkness as I waited for Charlie to check on me. Edward knew exactly what 
he was doing, and I was willing to bet that all the injured surprise was part of the ploy. Of 
course, I still had the Carlisle option, but now that I knew there was a chance that Edward 
would change me himself, I wanted it bad. He was such a cheater. 

My door cracked open. 

"Morning, Dad." 

"Oh, hey, Bella." He sounded embarrassed at getting caught. "I didn't know you were 
awake." 

"Yeah. I've just been waiting ior you to wake up so I could take a shower." I started to get 
up. 

"Hold on," Charlie said, flipping the light on. I blinked in the sudden brightness, and carefully 
kept my eyes away from the closet. "Let's talk for a minute first." 

I couldn't control my grimace. I'd forgotten to ask Alice for a good excuse. 

"You know you're in trouble." 

"Yeah, I know." 

"I just about went crazy these last three days. I come home from Harry's funeral, and you're 
gone. Jacob could only tell me that you'd run off with Alice Cullen, and that he thought you 
were in trouble. You didn't leave me a number, and you didn't call. I didn't know where you 
were or when-or if-you were coming back. Do you have any idea how... how..." He 
couldn't finish the sentence. He sucked in a sharp breath and moved on. "Can you give me 
one reason why I shouldn't ship you off to Jacksonville this second?" 

My eyes narrowed. So it was going to be threats, was it? Two could play at that game. I sat 
up, pulling the quilt around me. "Because I won't go." 

"Now just one minute, young lady-" 

"Look, Dad, I accept complete responsibility for my actions, and you have the right to 
ground me for as long as you want. I will also do all the chores and laundry and dishes until 
you think I've learned my lesson. And I guess you're within your rights if you want to kick me 
out, too-but that won't make me to go to Florida." 

His face turned bright red. He took a few deep breaths before he answered. 

"Would you l ik e to explain where you've been?" 




Oh, crap. "There was... an emergency." 

He raised his eyebrows in expectation of my brilliant explanation. 

I filled my cheeks with air and then blew it out noisily. "I don't know what to tell you, Dad. 
It was mostly a misunderstanding. He said, she said. It got out of hand." 

He waited with a distmstful expression. 

"See, Alice told Rosalie about me jumping off the cliff..." I was scrambling frantically to 
make this work, to keep it as close to the truth as possible so that my inability to lie 
convincingly would not undermine the excuse, but before I could go on, Charlie's expression 
reminded me that he didn't know arything about the cliff. 

Major oops. As if I wasn't already toast. 

"I guess I didn't tell you about that," I choked out. "It was nothing. Just messing around, 
swimming with Jake. Anyway, Rosalie told Edward, and he was upset. She sort of 
accidentally made it sound l ik e I wa? trying to kill myself or something. He wouldn't answer 
his phone, so Alice dragged me to... L.A., to explain in person." I shrugged, desperately 
hoping that he would not be so distracted by my slip that he'd miss the brilliant explanation 
I'd provided. 

Charlie's face was frozen. "Were you trying to kill yourself, Bella?" 

"No, of course not. Just having fun with Jake. Cliff diving. The La Push kids do it all the 
time. Like I said, nothing." 

Charlie's face heated up-from frozen to hot with fury. "What's it to Edward Cullen anyway?" 
he barked. "All this time, he's just left you dangling without a word-" 

I interrupted him. "Another misunderstanding." 

His face flushed again. "So is he back then?" 

"I'm not sure what the exact plan is. I think they all are." 

He shook his head, the vein in his forehead pulsing. "I want you to stay away from him, 
Bella. I don't trust him. He's rotten for you. I won't let him mess you up like that again." 

"Line," I said curtly. 

Charlie rocked back onto his heels. "Oh." He scrambled for a second, exhaling loudly in 
surprise. "I thought you were going to be difficult." 

"I am." I stared straight into his eyes. "I meant, 'Line, I'll move out.'" 



His eyes bulged; his face turned puce. My resolve wavered as I started to worry about his 




health. He was no younger than Harry. . . 



"Dad, I don't want to move out," I said in a softer tone. "I love you. I know you're worried, 
but you need to trust me on this. And you're going to have to ease up on Edward if you want 
me to stay. Do you want me to live here or not?" 

"That's not fair, Bella. You know I want you to stay." 

"Then be nice to Edward, because he's going to be where I am." I said it with confidence. 
The conviction of my epiphany was still strong. 

"Not under my roof," Charlie stormed. 

I sighed a heavy sigh. "Look, I'm not going to give you any more ultimatums tonight-or I 
guess it's this morning. Just think about it for a few days, okay? But keep in mind that 
Edward and I are sort of a package deal." 

"Bella-" 

"Think it over," I insisted. "And while you're doing that, could you give me some privacy? I 
really need a shower." 

Charlie's face was a strange shade of purple, but he left, slamming the door behind him. I 
heard him stomp furiously down the stairs. 

I threw off my quilt, and Edward was already there, sitting in the rocking chair as if he d 
been present through the whole conversation. 

"Sorry about that," I whispered. 

"It's not as if I don't deserve far worse," he murmured. "Don't start anything with Charlie 
over me, please. " 

"Don't worry about it," I breathed as I gathered up my bathroom things and a set of clean 
clothes. "I will start exactly as much as is necessary, and no more than that. Or are you trying 
to tell me I have nowhere to go?" I widened my eyes with false alarm. 

"You'd move in with a house full of vampires?" 

"That's probably the safest place for someone like me. Besides. . . " I grinned. "If Charlie kicks 
me out, then there's no need for a graduation deadline, is there?" 

His jaw tightened. "So eager for eternal damnation," he muttered. 

"You know you don't really believe that." 

"Oh, don't I?" he fumed. 




No. You don't. 



He glowered at me and started to speak, but I cut him off. 

"If you really believed that you'd lost your soul, then when I found you in Volterra, you 
would have realized immediately what was happening, instead of thinking we were both 
dead together. But you didn't-you said 'Amazing. Carlisle was right,’" I reminded him, 
triumphant. "There's hope in you, after all." 

For once, Edward was speechless. 

"So let's both just be hopeful, all right?" I suggested. "Not that it matters. If you stay, I don't 
need heaven." 

He got up slowly, and came to put his hands on either side of my face as he stared into my 
eyes. "Forever," he vowed, still a little staggered. 

"That's all I'm asking for," I said, and stretched up on my toes so that I could press my lips to 
his. 




EPILOGUE TREATY 



ALMOST EVERYTHING WAS BACK TO NORMAL-THE GOOD, pre-zombie 
normal-in less time than I would have believed possible. The hospital welcomed Carlisle 
back with eager arms, not even bothering to conceal their delight that Esme had found life in 
L.A. so little to her liking. Thanks to the Calculus test I'd missed while abroad, Alice and 
Edward were in better to shape to graduate than I was at the moment. Suddenly, college was 
a priority (college was still plan B, on the off chance that Edward's offer swayed me from the 
post-graduation Carlisle option). Many deadlines had passed me by, but Edward had a new 
stack of applications for me to fill out every day. He'd already done the Harvard route, so it 
didn't bother him that, thanks to my procrastination, we might both end up at Peninsula 
Community College next year. 

Charlie was not happy with me, or speaking to Edward. But at least Edward was 
allowed-during my designated visiting hours-inside the house again. I just wasn't allowed 
out of it. 

School and work were the only exceptions, and the dreary, dull yellow walls of my 
classrooms had become oddly inviting to me of late. That had a lot to do with the person 
who sat in the desk beside me. 

Edward had resumed his schedule from the beginning of the year, which put him in most of 
my classes again. My behavior had been such last fall, after the Cullens' supposed move to 
L.A., that the seat beside me had never been filled. Even Mike, always eager to take any 
advantage, had kept a safe distance. With Edward back in place, it was almost as if the last 
eight months were just a disturbing nightmare. 

Almost, but not quite. There was the house arrest situation, for one thing. And for another, 
before the fall, I hadn't been best friends with Jacob Black. So, of course, I hadn't missed h im 
then. 

I wasn't at liberty to go to La Push, and Jacob wasn't coming to see me. He wouldn't even 
answer my phone calls. 

I made these calls mostly at night, after Edward had been kicked out-promptly at nine by a 
grimly gleeful Charlie-and before Edward snuck back through my window when Charlie was 
asleep. I chose that time to make my fruitless calls because I'd noticed that Edward made a 
certain face every time I mentioned Jacob's name. Sort of disapproving and wary... maybe 
even angry. I guessed that he had some reciprocal prejudice against the werewolves, though 
he wasn't as vocal as Jacob had been about the "bloodsuckers." 

So, I didn't mention Jacob much. 

With Edward near me, it was hard to think about unhappy things-even my former besi 
fnend, who was probably very unhappy right now, due to me. When I did think of Jake, I 




always felt guilty for not thinking of h im more. 



The fairy tale was back on. Prince returned, bad spell broken. I wasn't sure exactly what to 
do about the leftover, unresolved character. Where was his happily ever after? 

Weeks passed, and Jacob still wouldn't answer my calls. It started to become a constant 
worry. Like a dripping faucet in the back of my head that I couldn't shut off or ignore. Drip, 
drip, drip. Jacob, Jacob, Jacob. 

So, though I didn't mention Jacob much, sometimes my frustration and anxiety boiled over. 

"It's just plain rude!" I vented one Saturday afternoon when Edward picked me up from 
work. Being angry about things was easier than feeling guilty. "Downright insulting!" 

I'd varied my pattern, in hopes of a different response. I'd called Jake from work this time, 
only to get an unhelpful Billy. Again. 

"Billy said he didn't want to talk to me," I fumed, glaring at the rain oozing down the 
passenger window. 

"That he was there, and wouldn't walk three steps to get to the phone! Usually Billy just says 
he's out or busy or sleeping or something. I mean, it's not l ik e I didn't know he was lying to 
me, but at least it was a polite way to handle it. I guess Billy hates me now, too. It's not fair!" 

"It's not you, Bella," Edward said quietly. "Nobody hates you." 

"Feels that way," I muttered, folding my arms across my chest. It was no more than a 
stubborn gesture. There was no hole there now-I could barely remember the empty feeling 
anymore. 

"Jacob knows we're back, and I'm sure that he's ascertained that I'm with you," Edward said. 
"He won’t come anywhere near me. The enmity is rooted too deeply." 

"That's stupid. He knows you're not... l ik e other vampires." 

"There's still good reason to keep a safe distance." 

I glared blindly out the windshield, seeing only Jacob's face, set in the bitter mask I hated. 

"Bella, we are what we are," Edward said quietly. "I can control myself, but I doubt he can. 
He's very young. It would most likely turn into a fight, and I don't know if I could stop it 
before I k-" he broke off, and then quickly continued. "Before I hurt him. You would be 
unhappy. I don't want that to happen." 

I remembered what Jacob had said in the kitchen, hearing the words with perfect recall in his 
husky voice. I'm not sure that I'm even-tempered enough to handle that... You probably 
wouldn 7 like it so much if I killed your friend. But he'd been able to handle it, that time. . . 




Edward Cullen," I whispered. "Were you about to say 'killed him? Were you?' 



He looked away from me, staring into the rain. In front of us, the red light I hadn't noticed 
turned green and he started forward again, driving very slowly. Not his usual way of driving. 

"I would try. . . very hard. . . not to do that," Edward finally said. 

I stared at h im with my mouth hanging open, but he continued to look straight ahead. We 
were paused at the comer stop sign. 

Abruptly, I remembered what had happened to Paris when Romeo came back. The stage 
directions were simple: They fight. Paris falls. 

But that was ridiculous. Impossible. 

"Well," I said, and took a deep breath, shaking my head to dispel the words in my head. 
"Nothing l ik e that is ever going to happen, so there's no reason to worry about it. And you 
know Charlie's staring at the clock right now. You'd better get me home before I get in more 
trouble for being late." 

I turned my face up toward him, to smile halfheartedly. 

Every time I looked at his face, that impossibly perfect face, my heart pounded strong and 
healthy and very there in my chest. This time, the pounding raced ahead of its usual besotted 
pace. I recognized the expression on his statue-still face. 

"You're already in more trouble, Bella," he whispered through unmoving lips. 

I slid closer, clutching his arm as I followed his gaze to see what he was seeing. I don't know 
what I expected-maybe Victoria standing in the middle of the street, her flaming red hair 
blowing in the wind, or a line of tall black cloaks... or a pack of angry werewolves. But I 
didn't see anything at all. 

"What? What is it?" 

He took a deep breath. "Charlie. . ." 

"My dad?" I screeched. 

He looked down at me then, and his expression was calm enough to ease some of my panic. 

"Charlie... is probably not going to kill you, but he's thinking about it," he told me. He 
started to drive forward again, down my street, but he passed the house and parked by the 
edge of the trees. 

"What did I do?" I gasped. 

Edward glanced back at Charlie's house. I followed his gaze, and noticed for the first time 




what was parked in the driveway next to the cruiser. Shiny, bright red, impossible to miss. 
My motorcycle, flaunting itself in the driveway. 

Edward had said that Charlie was ready to kill me, so he must know that-that it was mine. 
There was only one person who could be behind this treachery. 

"No!" I gasped. "Why? Why would Jacob do this to me?" The sting of betrayal washed 
through me. I had trusted Jacob implicitly-trusted him with every single secret I had. He was 
supposed to be my safe harbor-the person I could always rely on. Of course things were 
strained right now, but I didn't think any of the underlying foundation had changed. I didn't 
think that was changeable! 

What had I done to deserve this? Charlie was going to be so mad-and worse than that, he 
was going to be hurt and worried. Didn't he have enough to deal with already? I would have 
never imagined that Jake could be so petty and just plain mean. Tears sprang, smarting, into 
my eyes, but they were not tears of sadness. I had been betrayed. I was suddenly so angry 
that my head throbbed l ik e it was going to explode. 

"Is he still here?" I hissed. 

"Yes. He's waiting for us there." Edward told me, nodding toward the slender path that 
divided the dark fringe of the forest in two. 

I jumped out of the car, launching myself toward the trees with my hands already balled into 
fists for the first punch. 

Why did Edward have to be so much faster than me? 

He caught me around the waist before I made the path. 

"Let me go! I'm going to murder him! Traitor!" I shouted the epithet toward the trees. 

"Charlie will hear you," Edward warned me. "And once he gets you inside, he may brick over 
the doorway." 

I glanced back at the house instinctively, and it seemed l ik e the glossy red bike was all I 
could see. I was seeing red. My head throbbed again. 

"Just give me one round with Jacob, and then I'll deal with Charlie." I struggled futilely to 
break free. 

"Jacob Black wants to see me. That's why he's still here." 

That stopped me cold-took the fight right out of me. My hands went limp. They fight; Paris 
falls. 



I was furious, but not that furious. 




Talk?" I asked. 



"More or less." 

"How much more?" My voice shook. 

Edward smoothed my hair back from my face. "Don't worry, he's not here to fight me. He's 
acting as. . . spokesperson for the pack." 

"Oh." 

Edward looked at the house again, then tightened his arm around my waist and pulled me 
toward the woods. "We should hurry. Charlie's getting impatient." 

We didn't have to go far; Jacob waited just a short ways up the path. He lounged against a 
mossy tree trunk as he waited, his face hard and bitter, exactly the way I knew it would be. 
He looked at me, and then at Edward. Jacob's mouth stretched into a humorless sneer, and 
he shrugged away from the tree. He stood on the balls of his bare feet, leaning slightly 
forward, with his trembling hands clenched into fists. He looked bigger than the last time I'd 
seen him. Somehow, impossibly, he was still growing. He would tower over Edward, if they 
stood next to each other. 

But Edward stopped as soon as we saw him, leaving a wide space between us and Jacob. 
Edward turned his body, shifting me so that I was behind him. I leaned around him to stare at 
Jacob-to accuse him with my eyes. 

I would have thought that seeing his resentful, cynical expression would only make me 
angrier. Instead, it reminded me of the last time I'd seen him, with tears in his eyes. My fury 
weakened, faltered, as I stared at Jacob. It had been so long since I'd seen him-I hated that 
our reunion had to be like this. 

"Bella," Jacob said as a greeting, nodding once toward me without looking away from 
Edward. 

"Why?" I whispered, trying to hide the sound of the lump in my throat. "How could you do 
this to me, Jacob?" 

The sneer vanished, but his face stayed hard and rigid. "It's for the best." 

"What is that supposed to mean? Do you want Charlie to strangle me? Or did you want h im 
to have a heart attack, l ik e Harry? No matter how mad you are at me, how could you do this 
to him?' 

Jacob winced, and his eyebrows pulled together, but he didn't answer. 

"He didn't want to hurt anyone-he just wanted to get you grounded, so that you wouldn't be 
allowed to spend time with me," Edward murmured, explaining the thoughts Jacob wouldn't 




say. 

Jacob's eyes sparked with hate as he glowered at Edward again. 

"Aw, Jake!" I groaned. "I'm already grounded! Why do you think I haven't been down to La 
Push to kick your butt for avoiding my phone calls?" 

Jacob's eyes flashed back to me, confused for the first time. "That's why?" he asked, and then 
locked his jaw, like he was sorry he'd said anything. 

"He thought / wouldn't let you, not Charlie," Edward explained again. 

"Stop that," Jacob snapped. 

Edward didn't answer. 

Jacob shuddered once, and then gritted his teeth as hard as his fists. "Bella wasn't 
exaggerating about your... abilities," he said through his teeth. "So you must already know 
why I'm here." 

"Yes," Edward agreed in a soft voice. "But, before you begin, I need to say something." 

Jacob waited, clenching and unclenching his hands as he tried to control the shivers rolling 
down his arms. 

"Thank you," Edward said, and his voice throbbed with the depth of his sincerity. "I will 
never be able to tell you how grateful I am. I will owe you for the rest of my. . . existence." 

Jacob stared at him blankly, his shudders stilled by surprise. He exchanged a quick glance 
with me, but my face was just as mystified. 

"For keeping Bella alive," Edward clarified, his voice rough and fervent. "When I. . . didn't." 

"Edward-," I started to say, but he held one hand up, his eyes on Jacob. 

Understanding washed over Jacob's face before the hard mask returned. "I didn't do it for 
your benefit." 

"I know. But that doesn't erase the gratitude I feel. I thought you should know. If there's ever 
anything in my power to do for you. . ." 

Jacob raised one black brow. 

Edward shook his head. "That's not in my power." 

"Whose, then?" Jacob growled. 

Edward looked down at me. "Hers. I'm a quick learner, Jacob Black, and I don't make the 




same mistake twice. I'm here until she orders me away. 



I was immersed momentarily in his golden gaze. It wasn't hard to understand what I'd missed 
in the conversation. The only thing that Jacob would want from Edward would be his 
absence. 

"Never," I whispered, still locked in Edward's eyes. 

Jacob made a gagging sound. 

I unwillingly broke free from Edward's gaze to frown at Jacob. "Was there something else 
you needed, Jacob? You wanted me in trouble-mission Accomplished. Charlie might just 
send me to military school. But that won't keep me away from Edward. There's nothing that 
can do that. What more do you want?" 

Jacob kept his eyes on Edward "I just needed to remind your bloodsucking friends of a few 
key points in the treaty they agreed to. The treaty chat is the only thing stopping me from 
ripping his throat out right this minute." 

"We haven't forgotten," Edward said at the same time that I demanded, "What key points?" 

Jacob still glowered at Edward, but he answered me. "The treaty is quite specific. If any of 
them bite a human, the truce is over. Bite, not kill," he emphasized. Finally, he looked at me. 
His eyes were cold. 

It only took me a second to grasp the distinction, and then my face was as cold as his. 

"That's none of your business." 

"The hell it-" was all he managed to choke out. 

I didn't expect my hasty words to bring on such a strong response. Despite the warning he'd 
come to give, he must not have known. He must have thought the warning was just a 
precaution. He hadn't realized-or didn't want to believe-that I had already made my choice. 
That I was really intending to become a member of the Cullen family. 

My answer sent Jacob into near convulsions. He pressed his fists hard against his temples, 
closing his eyes tight and curling in on himself as he tried to control the spasms. His face 
turned sallow green under the russet skin. 

"Jake? You okay?" I asked anxiously. 

I took a half-step toward him, then Edward caught me and yanked me back behind his own 
body. "Careful! He's not under control," he warned me. 

But Jacob was already somewhat himself again; only his arms were shaking now. He 
scowled at Edward with pure hate. "Ugh. / would never hurt her." 




Neither Edward or I missed the inflection, or the accusation it contained. A low hiss escaped 
Edward's lips. Jacob clenched his fists reflexively. 

"BELLA!" Charlie's roar echoed from the direction of the house. "YOU GET IN THIS 
HOUSE THIS INSTANT!" 

All of us froze, listening to the silence that followed. 

I was the first to speak; my voice trembled. "Crap." 

Jacob's furious expression faltered. "I am sorry about that," he muttered. "I had to do what I 
could-I had to try ... " 

"Thanks." The tremor in my voice ruined the sarcasm. I stared up the path, half-expecting 
Charlie to come barreling through the wet ferns l ik e an enraged bull. I would be the red flag 
in that scenario. 

"Just one more thing," Edward said to me, and then he looked at Jacob. "We've found no 
trace of Victoria on our side of the line-have you?" 

He knew the answer as soon as Jacob thought it, but Jacob spoke the answer anyway. "Trie 
last time was while Bella was... away. We let her think she was slipping through-we were 
tightening the circle, getting ready to ambush her-" 

Ice shot down my spine. 

"But then she took off like a bat out of hell. Near as we can tell, she caught your little 
female's scent and bailed. She hasn't come near our lands since." 

Edward nodded. "When she comes back, she's not your problem anymore. We'll-" 

"She killed on our turf," Jacob hissed. "She's ours!" 

"No-," I began to protest both declarations. 

"BELLA'. I SEE HIS CAR AND I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE! IF YOU AREN'T 
INSIDE THIS HOUSE IN ONE MINUTE. . . !" Charlie didn't bother to finish his threat. 

"Let's go," Edward said. 

I looked back at Jacob, torn. Would I see him again? 

"Sorry," he whispered so low that I had to read his lips to understand. "'Bye, Bells." 

"You promised," I reminded him desperately. "Still friends, right?" 

Jacob shook his head slowly, and the lump in my throat nearly strangled me. 




"You know how hard I've tried to keep that promise, but... I can't see how to keep trying. 
Not now..." He struggled to keep his hard mask in place, but it wavered, and then 
disappeared. "Miss you," he mouthed. One of his hands reached toward me, his fingers 
outstretched, like he wished they were long enough to cross the distance between us. 

"Me, too," I choked out. My hand reached toward his across the wide space. 

Like we were connected, the echo of his pain twisted inside me. His pain, my pain. 

"Jake. . ." I took a step toward him. I wanted to wrap my arms around his waist and erase the 
expression of misery on his face. 

Edward pulled me back again, his arms restraining instead of defending. 

"It's okay," I promised him, looking up to read his face with trust in my eyes. He would 
understand. 

His eyes were unreadable, his face expressionless. Cold. "No, it's not." 

"Let her go," Jacob snarled, furious again. "She wants to!" He took two long strides forward. 
A glint of anticipation flashed in his eyes. His chest seemed to swell as it shuddered. 

Edward pushed me behind himself, wheeling to face Jacob. 

"No! Edward-!" 

"ISABELLA SWAN\” 

"Come on! Charlie's mad!" My voice was panicked, but not because of Charlie now. "Hurry!" 

I tugged on him and he relaxed a little. He pulled me back slowly, always keeping his eyes on 
Jacob as we retreated. 

Jacob watched us with a dark scowl on his bitter face. The anticipation drained from his 
eyes, and then, just before the forest came between us, his face suddenly crumpled in pain. 

I knew that last glimpse of his face would haunt me until I saw him smile again. 

And right there I vowed that I would see him smile, and soon. I would find a way to keep my 
friend. 

Edward kept his arm tight around my waist, holding me close. That was the only thing that 
held the tears inside my eyes. 

I had some serious problems. 

My best friend counted me with his enemies. 




Victoria was still on the loose, putting everyone I loved in danger. 

If I didn't become a vampire soon, the Volturi would kill me. 

And now it seemed that if I did, the Quileute werewolves would try to do the job 
themselves-along with trying to kill my future family. I didn't think they had any chance 
really, but would my best friend get himself killed in the attempt? 

Very serious problems. So why did they all suddenly seem insignificant when we broke 
through the last of the trees and I caught sight of the expression on Charlie's purple face? 

Edward squeezed me gently. "I'm here." 

I drew in a deep breath. 

That was true. Edward was here, with his arms around me. 

I could face anything as long as that was true. 

I squared my shoulders and walked forward to meet my fate, with my destiny solidly at my 
side. 

ace 



All our attempts at subterfage had been in vain. 

With ice in my heart, I watched him prepare to defend 
me. His intense concentration betrayed no hint of 
doubt, though he was outnumbered. I knew that we 
could expect no help — at this moment, his family 
was fighting for their lives just as surely as he was for 
ours. 

Would I ever learn the outcome of that other fight? 
Find out who the winners and the losers were? Would 
I live long enough for that? 

The odds of that didn’t look so great. 

Black eyes, wild with their fierce craving for my death, 
watched for the moment when my protector’s 
attention would be diverted. The moment when I 
would surely die. 

Somewhere, far, far away in the cold forest, a wolf 
howled.

I ran my fingers across the page, feeling the dents 
where he had pressed the pen to the paper so hard 
that it had nearly broken through. I could picture him 
writing this — scrawling the angry letters in his rough 
handwriting, slashing through line after line when the 
words came out wrong, maybe even snapping the pen 
in his too-big hand; that would explain the ink 
splatters. I could imagine the frustration pulling his 
black eyebrows together and crumpling his forehead. 
If I’d been there, I might have laughed. Don’t give 
yourself a brain hemorrhage, Jacob, I would have told 
him. Just spit it out. 



3 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Laughing was the last thing I felt like doing now as I 
reread the words I’d already memorized. His answer 
to my pleading note — passed from Charlie to Billy to 
him, just like second grade, as he’d pointed out — 
was no surprise. I’d known the essence of what it 
would say before I’d opened it. 

What was surprising was how much each crossed-out 
line wounded me — as if the points of the letters had 
cutting edges. More than that, behind each angry 
beginning lurked a vast pool of hurt; Jacob’s pain cut 
me deeper than my own. 

While I was pondering this, I caught the 
unmistakable scent of a smoking burner rising from 
the kitchen. In another house, the fact that someone 
besides myself was cooking might not be a cause for 
panicking. 

I shoved the wrinkled paper into my back pocket and 
ran, making it downstairs in the nick of time. 

The jar of spaghetti sauce Charlie ’d stuck in the 
microwave was only on its first revolution when I 
yanked the door open and pulled it out. 

“What did I do wrong?” Charlie demanded. 

“You’re supposed to take the lid off first, Dad. Metal’s 
bad for microwaves.” I swiftly removed the lid as I 
spoke, poured half the sauce into a bowl, and then 
put the bowl inside the microwave and the jar back in 
the fridge; I fixed the time and pressed start. 

Charlie watched my adjustments with pursed lips. 
“Did I get the noodles right?” 

I looked in the pan on the stove — the source of the 
smell that had alerted me. “Stirring helps,” I said 

4 | Page Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




mildly. I found a spoon and tried to de-clump the 
mushy hunk that was scalded to the bottom. 

Charlie sighed. 

“So what’s all this about?” I asked him. 

He folded his arms across his chest and glared out 
the back windows into the sheeting rain. “Don’t know 
what you’re talking about,” he grumbled. 

I was mystified. Charlie cooking? And what was with 
the surly attitude? Edward wasn’t here yet; usually 
my dad reserved this kind of behavior for my 
boyfriend’s benefit, doing his best to illustrate the 
theme of “unwelcome” with every word and posture. 
Charlie’s efforts were unnecessary — Edward knew 
exactly what my dad was thinking without the show. 

The word boyfriend had me chewing on the inside of 
my cheek with a familiar tension while I stirred. It 
wasn’t the right word, not at all. I needed something 
more expressive of eternal commitment... . But words 
like destiny and fate sounded hokey when you used 
them in casual conversation. 

Edward had another word in mind, and that word 
was the source of the tension I felt. It put my teeth on 
edge just to think it to myself. 

Fiancee. Ugh. I shuddered away from the thought. 

“Did I miss something? Since when do you make 
dinner?” I asked Charlie. The pasta lump bobbed in 
the boiling water as I poked it. “Or try to make dinner, 
I should say.” 

Charlie shrugged. “There’s no law that says I can’t 
cook in my own house.” 

5 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You would know,” I replied, grinning as I eyed the 
badge pinned to his leather jacket. 

“Ha. Good one.” He shrugged out of the jacket as if 
my glance had reminded him he still had it on, and 
hung it on the peg reserved for his gear. His gun belt 
was already slung in place — he hadn’t felt the need 
to wear that to the station for a few weeks. There had 
been no more disturbing disappearances to trouble 
the small town of Forks, Washington, no more 
sightings of the giant, mysterious wolves in the ever- 
rainy woods... . 

I prodded the noodles in silence, guessing that 
Charlie would get around to talking about whatever 
was bothering him in his own time. My dad was not a 
man of many words, and the effort he had put into 
trying to orchestrate a sit-down dinner with me made 
it clear there were an uncharacteristic number of 
words on his mind. 

I glanced at the clock routinely — something I did 
every few minutes around this time. Less than a half 
hour to go now. 

Afternoons were the hardest part of my day. Ever 
since my former best friend (and werewolf), Jacob 
Black, had informed on me about the motorcycle I’d 
been riding on the sly — a betrayal he had devised in 
order to get me grounded so that I couldn’t spend 
time with my boyfriend (and vampire), Edward Cullen 
— Edward had been allowed to see me only from 
seven till nine-thirty p.m., always inside the confines 
of my home and under the supervision of my dad’s 
unfailingly crabby glare. 

This was an escalation from the previous, slightly less 
stringent grounding that I’d earned for an 



6 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




unexplained three-day disappearance and one 
episode of cliff diving. 



Of course, I still saw Edward at school, because there 
wasn’t anything Charlie could do about that. And 
then, Edward spent almost every night in my room, 
too, but Charlie wasn’t precisely aware of that. 
Edward’s ability to climb easily and silently through 
my second-story window was almost as useful as his 
ability to read Charlie’s mind. 

Though the afternoon was the only time I spent away 
from Edward, it was enough to make me restless, and 
the hours always dragged. Still, I endured my 
punishment without complaining because — for one 
thing — I knew I’d earned it, and — for another — 
because I couldn’t bear to hurt my dad by moving out 
now, when a much more permanent separation 
hovered, invisible to Charlie, so close on my horizon. 

My dad sat down at the table with a grunt and 
unfolded the damp newspaper there; within seconds 
he was clucking his tongue in disapproval. 

“I don’t know why you read the news, Dad. It only 
ticks you off.” 

He ignored me, grumbling at the paper in his hands. 
“This is why everyone wants to live in a small town! 
Ridiculous.” 

“What have big cities done wrong now?” 

“Seattle’s making a run for murder capital of the 
country. Five unsolved homicides in the last two 
weeks. Can you imagine living like that?” 

“I think Phoenix is actually higher up the homicide 
list, Dad. I have lived like that.” And I’d never come 

7 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




close to being a murder victim until after I moved to 
his safe little town. In fact, I was still on several hit 
lists... . The spoon shook in my hands, making the 
water tremble. 

“Well, you couldn’t pay me enough,” Charlie said. 

I gave up on saving dinner and settled for serving it; I 
had to use a steak knife to cut a portion of spaghetti 
for Charlie and then myself, while he watched with a 
sheepish expression. Charlie coated his helping with 
sauce and dug in. I disguised my own clump as well 
as I could and followed his example without much 
enthusiasm. We ate in silence for a moment. Charlie 
was still scanning the news, so I picked up my much- 
abused copy of Wuthering Heights from where I’d left 
it this morning at breakfast, and tried to lose myself 
in turn-of-the-century England while I waited for him 
to start talking. 

I was just to the part where Heathcliff returns when 
Charlie cleared his throat and threw the paper to the 
floor. 

“You’re right,” Charlie said. “I did have a reason for 
doing this.” He waved his fork at the gluey spread. “I 
wanted to talk to you.” 

I laid the book aside; the binding was so destroyed 
that it slumped flat to the table. “You could have just 
asked.” 

He nodded, his eyebrows pulling together. “Yeah. I’ll 
remember that next time. I thought taking dinner off 
your hands would soften you up.” 

I laughed. “It worked — your cooking skills have me 
soft as a marshmallow. What do you need, Dad?” 



8 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Well, it’s about Jacob.” 



I felt my face harden. “What about him?” I asked 
through stiff lips. 

“Easy, Bells. I know you’re still upset that he told on 
you, but it was the right thing. He was being 
responsible.” 

“Responsible,” I repeated scathingly, rolling my eyes. 
“Right. So, what about Jacob?” 

The careless question repeated inside my head, 
anything but trivial. What about Jacob? What was I 
going to do about him? My former best friend who 
was now ... what? My enemy? I cringed. 

Charlie’s face was suddenly wary. “Don’t get mad at 
me, okay?” 

“Mad?” 

“Well, it’s about Edward, too.” 

My eyes narrowed. 

Charlie’s voice got gruffer. “I let him in the house, 
don’t I?” 

“You do,” I admitted. “For brief periods of time. Of 
course, you might let me out of the house for brief 
periods now and then, too,” I continued — only 
jokingly; I knew I was on lockdown for the duration of 
the school year. “I’ve been pretty good lately.” 

“Well, that’s kind of where I was heading with this... .” 
And then Charlie’s face stretched into an unexpected 
eye-crinkling grin; for a second he looked twenty 
years younger. 

9 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I saw a dim glimmer of possibility in that smile, but I 
proceeded slowly. “I’m confused, Dad. Are we talking 
about Jacob, or Edward, or me being grounded?” 

The grin flashed again. “Sort of all three.” 

“And how do they relate?” I asked, cautious. 

“Okay.” He sighed, raising his hands as if in 
surrender. “So I’m thinking maybe you deserve a 
parole for good behavior. For a teenager, you’re 
amazingly non-whiney.” 

My voice and eyebrows shot up. “Seriously? I’m free?” 

Where was this coming from? I’d been positive I would 
be under house arrest until I actually moved out, and 
Edward hadn’t picked up any wavering in Charlie’s 
thoughts... . 

Charlie held up one finger. “Conditionally.” 

The enthusiasm vanished. “Fantastic,” I groaned. 

“Bella, this is more of a request than a demand, okay? 
You’re free. But I’m hoping you’ll use that freedom ... 
judiciously.” 

“What does that mean?” 

He sighed again. “I know you’re satisfied to spend all 
of your time with Edward — ” 

“I spend time with Alice, too,” I interjected. Edward’s 
sister had no hours of visitation; she came and went 
as she pleased. Charlie was putty in her capable 
hands. 



10 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“That’s true,” he said. “But you have other friends 
besides the Cullens, Bella. Or you used to.” 

We stared at each other for a long moment. 

“When was the last time you spoke to Angela Weber?” 
he threw at me. 

“Friday at lunch,” I answered immediately. 

Before Edward’s return, my school friends had 
polarized into two groups. I liked to think of those 
groups as good vs. evil. Us and them worked, too. The 
good guys were Angela, her steady boyfriend Ben 
Cheney, and Mike Newton; these three had all very 
generously forgiven me for going crazy when Edward 
left. Lauren Mallory was the evil core of the them side, 
and almost everyone else, including my first friend in 
Forks, Jessica Stanley, seemed content to go along 
with her anti-Bella agenda. 

With Edward back at school, the dividing line had 
become even more distinct. 

Edward’s return had taken its toll on Mike’s 
friendship, but Angela was unswervingly loyal, and 
Ben followed her lead. Despite the natural aversion 
most humans felt toward the Cullens, Angela sat 
dutifully beside Alice every day at lunch. After a few 
weeks, Angela even looked comfortable there. It was 
difficult not to be charmed by the Cullens — once one 
gave them the chance to be charming. 

“Outside of school?” Charlie asked, calling my 
attention back. 

“I haven’t seen anyone outside of school, Dad. 
Grounded, remember? And Angela has a boyfriend, 



11 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




too. She’s always with Ben. If I’m really free,” I added, 
heavy on the skepticism, “maybe we could double.” 

“Okay. But then ...” He hesitated. “You and Jake used 
to be joined at the hip, and now — ” 

I cut him off. “Can you get to the point, Dad? What’s 
your condition — exactly?” 

“I don’t think you should dump all your other friends 
for your boyfriend, Bella,” he said in a stern voice. 

“It’s not nice, and I think your life would be better 
balanced if you kept some other people in it. What 
happened last September ...” 

I flinched. 

“Well,” he said defensively. “If you’d had more of a life 
outside of Edward Cullen, it might not have been like 
that.” 

“It would have been exactly like that,” I muttered. 
“Maybe, maybe not.” 

“The point?” I reminded him. 

“Use your new freedom to see your other friends, too. 
Keep it balanced.” 

I nodded slowly. “Balance is good. Do I have specific 
time quotas to fill, though?” 

He made a face, but shook his head. “I don’t want to 
make this complicated. Just don’t forget your friends 



12 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




It was a dilemma I was already struggling with. My 
friends. People who, for their own safety, I would 
never be able to see again after graduation. 

So what was the better course of action? Spend time 
with them while I could? Or start the separation now 
to make it more gradual? I quailed at the idea of the 
second option. 

"... particularly Jacob,” Charlie added before I could 
think things through more than that. 

A greater dilemma than the first. It took me a moment 
to find the right words. “Jacob might be ... difficult.” 

“The Blacks are practically family, Bella,” he said, 
stern and fatherly again. “And Jacob has been a very, 
very good friend to you.” 

“I know that.” 

“Don’t you miss him at all?” Charlie asked, frustrated. 

My throat suddenly felt swollen; I had to clear it twice 
before I answered. “Yes, I do miss him,” I admitted, 
still looking down. “I miss him a lot.” 

“Then why is it difficult?” 

It wasn’t something I was at liberty to explain. It was 
against the rules for normal people — human people 
like me and Charlie — to know about the clandestine 
world full of myths and monsters that existed secretly 
around us. I knew all about that world — and I was in 
no small amount of trouble as a result. I wasn’t about 
to get Charlie in the same trouble. 

“With Jacob there is a ... conflict,” I said slowly. “A 
conflict about the friendship thing, I mean. 

13 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




Friendship doesn’t always seem to be enough for 
Jake.” I wound my excuse out of details that were 
true but insignificant, hardly crucial compared to the 
fact that Jacob’s werewolf pack bitterly hated 
Edward’s vampire family — and therefore me, too, as I 
fully intended to join that family. It just wasn’t 
something I could work out with him in a note, and 
he wouldn’t answer my calls. But my plan to deal 
with the werewolf in person had definitely not gone 
over well with the vampires. 

“Isn’t Edward up for a little healthy competition?” 
Charlie’s voice was sarcastic now. 

I leveled a dark look at him. “There’s no competition.” 

“You’re hurting Jake’s feelings, avoiding him like this. 
He’d rather be just friends than nothing.” 

Oh, now I was avoiding him? 

“I’m pretty sure Jake doesn’t want to be friends at 
all.” The words burned in my mouth. “Where ’d you 
get that idea, anyway?” 

Charlie looked embarrassed now. “The subject might 
have come up today with Billy... .” 

“You and Billy gossip like old women,” I complained, 
stabbing my fork viciously into the congealed 
spaghetti on my plate. 

“Billy’s worried about Jacob,” Charlie said. “Jake’s 
having a hard time right now... . He’s depressed.” 

I winced, but kept my eyes on the blob. 

“And then you were always so happy after spending 
the day with Jake.” Charlie sighed. 

14 | Page Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




‘Tm happy now,” I growled fiercely through my teeth. 

The contrast between my words and tone broke 
through the tension. Charlie burst into laughter, and 
I had to join in. 

“Okay, okay,” I agreed. “Balance.” 

“And Jacob,” he insisted. 

“Ill try.” 

“Good. Find that balance, Bella. And, oh, yeah, you’ve 
got some mail,” Charlie said, closing the subject with 
no attempt at subtlety. “It’s by the stove.” 

I didn’t move, my thoughts twisting into snarls 
around Jacob’s name. It was most likely junk mail; I’d 
just gotten a package from my mom yesterday and I 
wasn’t expecting anything else. 

Charlie shoved his chair away from the table and 
stretched as he got to his feet. He took his plate to the 
sink, but before he turned the water on to rinse it, he 
paused to toss a thick envelope at me. The letter 
skidded across the table and thunked into my elbow. 

“Er, thanks,” I muttered, puzzled by his pushiness. 
Then I saw the return address — the letter was from 
the University of Alaska Southeast. “That was quick. I 
guess I missed the deadline on that one, too.” 

Charlie chuckled. 

I flipped the envelope over and then glared up at him. 
“It’s open.” 

“I was curious.” 



15 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I’m shocked, Sheriff. That’s a federal crime.” 

“Oh, just read it.” 

I pulled out the letter, and a folded schedule of 
courses. 

“Congratulations,” he said before I could read 
anything. “Your first acceptance.” 

“Thanks, Dad.” 

“We should talk about tuition. I’ve got some money 
saved up — ” 

“Hey, hey, none of that. I’m not touching your 
retirement, Dad. I’ve got my college fund.” What was 
left of it — and there hadn’t been much to begin with. 

Charlie frowned. “Some of these places are pretty 
pricey, Bells. I want to help. You don’t have to go to 
all the way to Alaska just because it’s cheaper.” 

It wasn’t cheaper, not at all. But it was far away, and 
Juneau had an average of three hundred twenty-one 
overcast days per year. The first was my prerequisite, 
the second was Edward’s. 

“I’ve got it covered. Besides, there’s lots of financial 
aid out there. It’s easy to get loans.” I hoped my bluff 
wasn’t too obvious. I hadn’t actually done a lot of 
research on the subject. 

“So ... ,” Charlie began, and then he pursed his lips 
and looked away. 

“So what?” 



16 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Nothing. I was just ...” He frowned. “Just wondering 
what ... Edward’s plans are for next year?” 

“Oh.” 

“Well?” 

Three quick raps on the door saved me. Charlie rolled 
his eyes and I jumped up. 

“Coming!” I called while Charlie mumbled something 
that sounded like, “Go away.” I ignored him and went 
to let Edward in. 

I wrenched the door out of my way — ridiculously 
eager — and there he was, my personal miracle. 

Time had not made me immune to the perfection of 
his face, and I was sure that I would never take any 
aspect of him for granted. My eyes traced over his 
pale white features: the hard square of his jaw, the 
softer curve of his full lips — twisted up into a smile 
now, the straight line of his nose, the sharp angle of 
his cheekbones, the smooth marble span of his 
forehead — partially obscured by a tangle of rain- 
darkened bronze hair... . 

I saved his eyes for last, knowing that when I looked 
into them I was likely to lose my train of thought. 

They were wide, warm with liquid gold, and framed by 
a thick fringe of black lashes. Staring into his eyes 
always made me feel extraordinary — sort of like my 
bones were turning spongy. I was also a little 
lightheaded, but that could have been because I’d 
forgotten to keep breathing. Again. 

It was a face any male model in the world would trade 
his soul for. Of course, that might be exactly the 
asking price: one soul. 

17 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




No. I didn’t believe that. I felt guilty for even thinking 
it, and was glad — as I was often glad — that I was 
the one person whose thoughts were a mystery to 
Edward. 

I reached for his hand, and sighed when his cold 
fingers found mine. His touch brought with it the 
strangest sense of relief — as if I’d been in pain and 
that pain had suddenly ceased. 

“Hey.” I smiled a little at my anticlimactic greeting. 

He raised our interlaced fingers to brush my cheek 
with the back of his hand. “How was your afternoon?” 

“Slow.” 

“For me, as well.” 

He pulled my wrist up to his face, our hands still 
twisted together. His eyes closed as his nose skimmed 
along the skin there, and he smiled gently without 
opening them. Enjoying the bouquet while resisting 
the wine, as he’d once put it. 

I knew that the scent of my blood — so much sweeter 
to him than any other person’s blood, truly like wine 
beside water to an alcoholic — caused him actual 
pain from the burning thirst it engendered. But he 
didn’t seem to shy away from it as much as he once 
had. I could only dimly imagine the Herculean effort 
behind this simple gesture. 

It made me sad that he had to try so hard. I 
comforted myself with the knowledge that I wouldn’t 
be causing him pain much longer. 

I heard Charlie approaching then, stamping his feet 
on the way to express his customary displeasure with 

18 | Page Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




our guest. Edward’s eyes snapped open and he let our 
hands fall, keeping them twined. 

“Good evening, Charlie.” Edward was always 
flawlessly polite, though Charlie didn’t deserve it. 

Charlie grunted at him, and then stood there with his 
arms crossed over his chest. He was taking the idea of 
parental supervision to extremes lately. 

“I brought another set of applications,” Edward told 
me then, holding up a stuffed manila envelope. He 
was wearing a roll of stamps like a ring around his 
littlest finger. 

I groaned. How were there any colleges left that he 
hadn’t forced me to apply to already? And how did he 
keep finding these loophole openings? It was so late 
in the year. 

He smiled as if he could read my thoughts; they must 
have been very obvious on my face. “There are still a 
few open deadlines. And a few places willing to make 
exceptions.” 

I could just imagine the motivations behind such 
exceptions. And the dollar amounts involved. 

Edward laughed at my expression. 

“Shall we?” he asked, towing me toward the kitchen 
table. 

Charlie huffed and followed behind, though he could 
hardly complain about the activity on tonight’s 
agenda. He’d been pestering me to make a decision 
about college on a daily basis. 



19 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I cleared the table quickly while Edward organized an 
intimidating stack of forms. When I moved Wuthering 
Heights to the counter, Edward raised one eyebrow. I 
knew what he was thinking, but Charlie interrupted 
before Edward could comment. 

“Speaking of college applications, Edward,” Charlie 
said, his tone even more sullen — he tried to avoid 
addressing Edward directly, and when he had to, it 
exacerbated his bad mood. “Bella and I were just 
talking about next year. Have you decided where 
you’re going to school?” 

Edward smiled up at Charlie and his voice was 
friendly. “Not yet. I’ve received a few acceptance 
letters, but I’m still weighing my options.” 

“Where have you been accepted?” Charlie pressed. 

“Syracuse ... Harvard ... Dartmouth ... and I just got 
accepted to the University of Alaska Southeast today.” 
Edward turned his face slightly to the side so that he 
could wink at me. I stifled a giggle. 

“Harvard? Dartmouth?” Charlie mumbled, unable to 
conceal his awe. “Well that’s pretty ... that’s 
something. Yeah, but the University of Alaska ... you 
wouldn’t really consider that when you could go Ivy 
League. I mean, your father would want you to ...” 

“Carlisle’s always fine with whatever I choose to do,” 
Edward told him serenely. 

“Hmph.” 

“Guess what, Edward?” I asked in a bright voice, 
playing along. 

“What, Bella?” 

20 | P a g e

I pointed to the thick envelope on the counter. “I just 
got my acceptance to the University of Alaska!” 

“Congratulations!” He grinned. “What a coincidence.” 

Charlie’s eyes narrowed and he glared back and forth 
between the two of us. “Fine,” he muttered after a 
minute. “I’m going to go watch the game, Bella. Nine- 
thirty.” 

That was his usual parting command. 

“Er, Dad? Remember the very recent discussion about 
my freedom ... ?” 

He sighed. “Right. Okay, ten-thirty. You still have a 
curfew on school nights.” 

“Bella’s no longer grounded?” Edward asked. Though 
I knew he wasn’t really surprised, I couldn’t detect 
any false note to the sudden excitement in his voice. 

“Conditionally,” Charlie corrected through his teeth. 
“What’s it to you?” 

I frowned at my dad, but he didn’t see. 

“It’s just good to know,” Edward said. “Alice has been 
itching for a shopping partner, and I’m sure Bella 
would love to see some city lights.” He smiled at me. 

But Charlie growled, “No!” and his face flushed 
purple. 

“Dad! What’s the problem?” 

He made an effort to unclench his teeth. “I don’t want 
you going to Seattle right now.” 



21 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Huh?” 



“I told you about that story in the paper — there’s 
some kind of gang on a killing spree in Seattle and I 
want you to steer clear, okay?” 

I rolled my eyes. “Dad, there’s a better chance that I’ll 
get struck by lightning than that the one day I’m in 
Seattle — ” 

“No, that’s fine, Charlie,” Edward said, interrupting 
me. “I didn’t mean Seattle. I was thinking Portland, 
actually. I wouldn’t have Bella in Seattle, either. Of 
course not.” 

I looked at him in disbelief, but he had Charlie’s 
newspaper in his hands and he was reading the front 
page intently. 

He must have been trying to appease my father. The 
idea of being in danger from even the most deadly of 
humans while I was with Alice or Edward was 
downright hilarious. 

It worked. Charlie stared at Edward for one second 
more, and then shrugged. “Fine.” He stalked off 
toward the living room, in a bit of a hurry now — 
maybe he didn’t want to miss tip-off. 

I waited till the TV was on, so that Charlie wouldn’t 
be able to hear me. 

“What — ,” I started to ask. 

“Hold on,” Edward said without looking up from the 
paper. His eyes stayed focused on the page as he 
pushed the first application toward me across the 
table. “I think you can recycle your essays for this 
one. Same questions.” 

22 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Charlie must still be listening. I sighed and started to 
fill out the repetitive information: name, address, 
social... . After a few minutes I glanced up, but 
Edward was now staring pensively out the window. As 
I bent my head back to my work, I noticed for the first 
time the name of the school. 

I snorted and shoved the papers aside. 

“Bella?” 

“Be serious, Edward. Dartmouth?” 

Edward lifted the discarded application and laid it 
gently in front of me again. “I think you’d like New 
Hampshire,” he said. “There’s a full complement of 
night courses for me, and the forests are very 
conveniently located for the avid hiker. Plentiful 
wildlife.” He pulled out the crooked smile he knew I 
couldn’t resist. 

I took a deep breath through my nose. 

“I’ll let you pay me back, if that makes you happy,” he 
promised. “If you want, I can charge you interest.” 

“Like I could even get in without some enormous 
bribe. Or was that part of the loan? The new Cullen 
wing of the library? Ugh. Why are we having this 
discussion again?” 

“Will you just fill out the application, please, Bella? It 
won’t hurt you to apply.” 

My jaw flexed. “You know what? I don’t think I will.” 

I reached for the papers, planning to crumple them 
into a suitable shape for lobbing at the trashcan, but 
they were already gone. I stared at the empty table for 

23 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




a moment, and then at Edward. He didn’t appear to 
have moved, but the application was probably already 
tucked away in his jacket. 

“What are you doing?” I demanded. 

“I sign your name better than you do yourself. You’ve 
already written the essays.” 

“You’re going way overboard with this, you know.” I 
whispered on the off chance that Charlie wasn’t 
completely lost in his game. “I really don’t need to 
apply anywhere else. I’ve been accepted in Alaska. I 
can almost afford the first semester’s tuition. It’s as 
good an alibi as any. There’s no need to throw away a 
bunch of money, no matter whose it is.” 

A pained looked tightened his face. “Bella — ” 

“Don’t start. I agree that I need to go through the 
motions for Charlie’s sake, but we both know I’m not 
going to be in any condition to go to school next fall. 
To be anywhere near people.” 

My knowledge of those first few years as a new 
vampire was sketchy. Edward had never gone into 
details — it wasn’t his favorite subject — but I knew it 
wasn’t pretty. Self-control was apparently an acquired 
skill. Anything more than correspondence school was 
out of the question. 

“I thought the timing was still undecided,” Edward 
reminded me softly. “You might enjoy a semester or 
two of college. There are a lot of human experiences 
you’ve never had.” 

“I’ll get to those afterward.” 



24 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“They won’t be human experiences afterward. You 
don’t get a second chance at humanity, Bella.” 



I sighed. “You’ve got to be reasonable about the 
timing, Edward. It’s just too dangerous to mess 
around with.” 

“There’s no danger yet,” he insisted. 

I glared at him. No danger? Sure. I only had a sadistic 
vampire trying to avenge her mate’s death with my 
own, preferably through some slow and torturous 
method. Who was worried about Victoria? And, oh 
yeah, the Volturi — the vampire royal family with 
their small army of vampire warriors — who insisted 
that my heart stop beating one way or another in the 
near future, because humans weren’t allowed to know 
they existed. Right. No reason at all to panic. 

Even with Alice keeping watch — Edward was relying 
on her uncannily accurate visions of the future to give 
us advance warning — it was insane to take chances. 

Besides, I’d already won this argument. The date for 
my transformation was tentatively set for shortly after 
my graduation from high school, only a handful of 
weeks away. 

A sharp jolt of unease pierced my stomach as I 
realized how short the time really was. Of course this 
change was necessary — and the key to what I 
wanted more than everything else in the world put 
together — but I was deeply conscious of Charlie 
sitting in the other room enjoying his game, just like 
every other night. And my mother, Renee, far away in 
sunny Florida, still pleading with me to spend the 
summer on the beach with her and her new husband. 
And Jacob, who, unlike my parents, would know 
exactly what was going on when I disappeared to 
25 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




some distant school. Even if my parents didn’t grow 
suspicious for a long time, even if I could put off visits 
with excuses about travel expenses or study loads or 
illnesses, Jacob would know the truth. 

For a moment, the idea of Jacob’s certain revulsion 
overshadowed every other pain. 

“Bella,” Edward murmured, his face twisting when he 
read the distress in mine. “There’s no hurry. I won’t 
let anyone hurt you. You can take all the time you 
need.” 

“I want to hurry,” I whispered, smiling weakly, trying 
to make a joke of it. “I want to be a monster, too.” 

His teeth clenched; he spoke through them. “You 
have no idea what you’re saying.” Abruptly, he flung 
the damp newspaper onto the table in between us. 

His finger stabbed the headline on the front page: 

DEATH TOLL ON THE RISE, POLICE FEAR GANG 
ACTIVITY 

“What does that have to do with anything?” 

“Monsters are not a joke, Bella.” 

I stared at the headline again, and then up to his 
hard expression. “A ... a vampire is doing this?” I 
whispered. 

He smiled without humor. His voice was low and cold. 
“You’d be surprised, Bella, at how often my kind are 
the source behind the horrors in your human news. 
It’s easy to recognize, when you know what to look 
for. The information here indicates a newborn 
vampire is loose in Seattle. Bloodthirsty, wild, out of 
control. The way we all were.” 

26 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I let my gaze drop to the paper again, avoiding his 
eyes. 

“We’ve been monitoring the situation for a few weeks. 
All the signs are there — the unlikely disappearances, 
always in the night, the poorly disposed-of corpses, 
the lack of other evidence... . Yes, someone brand- 
new. And no one seems to be taking responsibility for 
the neophyte... .” He took a deep breath. “Well, it’s not 
our problem. We wouldn’t even pay attention to the 
situation if wasn’t going on so close to home. Like I 
said, this happens all the time. The existence of 
monsters results in monstrous consequences.” 

I tried not to see the names on the page, but they 
jumped out from the rest of the print like they were in 
bold. The five people whose lives were over, whose 
families were mourning now. It was different from 
considering murder in the abstract, reading those 
names. Maureen Gardiner, Geoffrey Campbell, Grace 
Razi, Michelle O’Connell, Ronald Albrook. People 
who’d had parents and children and friends and pets 
and jobs and hopes and plans and memories and 
futures... . 

“It won’t be the same for me,” I whispered, half to 
myself. “You won’t let me be like that. We’ll live in 
Antarctica.” 

Edward snorted, breaking the tension. “Penguins. 
Lovely.” 

I laughed a shaky laugh and knocked the paper off 
the table so I wouldn’t have to see those names; it hit 
the linoleum with a thud. Of course Edward would 
consider the hunting possibilities. He and his 
“vegetarian” family — all committed to protecting 
human life — preferred the flavor of large predators 
for satisfying their dietary needs. “Alaska, then, as 
27 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




planned. Only somewhere much more remote than 
Juneau — somewhere with grizzlies galore.” 

“Better,” he allowed. “There are polar bears, too. Very 
fierce. And the wolves get quite large.” 

My mouth fell open and my breath blew out in a 
sharp gust. 

“What’s wrong?” he asked. Before I could recover, the 
confusion vanished and his whole body seemed to 
harden. “Oh. Never mind the wolves, then, if the idea 
is offensive to you.” His voice was stiff, formal, his 
shoulders rigid. 

“He was my best friend, Edward,” I muttered. It stung 
to use the past tense. “Of course the idea offends me.” 

“Please forgive my thoughtlessness,” he said, still very 
formal. “I shouldn’t have suggested that.” 

“Don’t worry about it.” I stared at my hands, clenched 
into a double fist on the table. 

We were both silent for a moment, and then his cool 
finger was under my chin, coaxing my face up. His 
expression was much softer now. 

“Sorry. Really.” 

“I know. I know it’s not the same thing. I shouldn’t 
have reacted that way. It’s just that ... well, I was 
already thinking about Jacob before you came over.” I 
hesitated. His tawny eyes seemed to get a little bit 
darker whenever I said Jacob’s name. My voice 
turned pleading in response. “Charlie says Jake is 
having a hard time. He’s hurting right now, and ... it’s 
my fault.” 



28 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You’ve done nothing wrong, Bella.” 



I took a deep breath. “I need to make it better, 

Edward. I owe him that. And it’s one of Charlie’s 
conditions, anyway — ” 

His face changed while I spoke, turning hard again, 
statue-like. 

“You know it’s out of the question for you to be 
around a werewolf unprotected, Bella. And it would 
break the treaty if any of us cross over onto their 
land. Do you want us to start a war?” 

“Of course not!” 

“Then there’s really no point in discussing the matter 
further.” He dropped his hand and looked away, 
searching for a subject change. His eyes paused on 
something behind me, and he smiled, though his eyes 
stayed wary. 

“I’m glad Charlie has decided to let you out — you’re 
sadly in need of a visit to the bookstore. I can’t believe 
you’re reading Wuthering Heights again. Don’t you 
know it by heart yet?” 

“Not all of us have photographic memories,” I said 
curtly. 

“Photographic memory or not, I don’t understand why 
you like it. The characters are ghastly people who 
ruin each others’ lives. I don’t know how Heathcliff 
and Cathy ended up being ranked with couples like 
Romeo and Juliet or Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. 
It isn’t a love story, it’s a hate story.” 

“You have some serious issues with the classics,” I 
snapped. 

29 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Perhaps it’s because I’m not impressed by antiquity.” 
He smiled, evidently satisfied that he’d distracted me. 
“Honestly, though, why do you read it over and over?” 
His eyes were vivid with real interest now, trying — 
again — to unravel the convoluted workings of my 
mind. He reached across the table to cradle my face 
in his hand. “What is it that appeals to you?” 

His sincere curiosity disarmed me. “I’m not sure,” I 
said, scrambling for coherency while his gaze 
unintentionally scattered my thoughts. “I think it’s 
something about the inevitability. How nothing can 
keep them apart — not her selfishness, or his evil, or 
even death, in the end... .” 

His face was thoughtful as he considered my words. 
After a moment he smiled a teasing smile. “I still 
think it would be a better story if either of them had 
one redeeming quality.” 

“I think that may be the point,” I disagreed. “Their 
love is their only redeeming quality.” 

“I hope you have better sense than that — to fall in 
love with someone so ... malignant.” 

“It’s a bit late for me to worry about who I fall in love 
with,” I pointed out. “But even without the warning, I 
seem to have managed fairly well.” 

He laughed quietly. “I’m glad you think so.” 

“Well, I hope you’re smart enough to stay away from 
someone so selfish. Catherine is really the source of 
all the trouble, not Heathcliff.” 

“I’ll be on my guard,” he promised. 



I sighed. He was so good at distractions. 

30 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




I put my hand over his to hold it to my face. “I need to 
see Jacob.” 



His eyes closed. “No.” 

“It’s truly not dangerous at all,” I said, pleading again. 
“I used to spend all day in La Push with the whole lot 
of them, and nothing ever happened.” 

But I made a slip; my voice faltered at the end 
because I realized as I was saying the words that they 
were a lie. It was not true that nothing had ever 
happened. A brief flash of memory — an enormous 
gray wolf crouched to spring, baring his dagger-like 
teeth at me — had my palms sweating with an echo of 
remembered panic. 

Edward heard my heart accelerate and nodded as if 
I’d acknowledged the lie aloud. “Werewolves are 
unstable. Sometimes, the people near them get hurt. 
Sometimes, they get killed.” 

I wanted to deny it, but another image slowed my 
rebuttal. I saw in my head the once beautiful face of 
Emily Young, now marred by a trio of dark scars that 
dragged down the corner of her right eye and left her 
mouth warped forever into a lopsided scowl. 

He waited, grimly triumphant, for me to find my voice. 

“You don’t know them,” I whispered. 

“I know them better than you think, Bella. I was here 
the last time.” 

“The last time?” 

“We started crossing paths with the wolves about 
seventy years ago... . We had just settled near 

31 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




Hoquiam. That was before Alice and Jasper were with 
us. We outnumbered them, but that wouldn’t have 
stopped it from turning into a fight if not for Carlisle. 
He managed to convince Ephraim Black that 
coexisting was possible, and eventually we made the 
truce.” 

Jacob’s great-grandfather’s name startled me. 

“We thought the line had died out with Ephraim,” 
Edward muttered; it sounded like he was talking to 
himself now. “That the genetic quirk which allowed 
the transmutation had been lost... .” He broke off and 
stared at me accusingly. “Your bad luck seems to get 
more potent every day. Do you realize that your 
insatiable pull for all things deadly was strong enough 
to recover a pack of mutant canines from extinction? 

If we could bottle your luck, we’d have a weapon of 
mass destruction on our hands.” 

I ignored the ribbing, my attention caught by his 
assumption — was he serious? “But I didn’t bring 
them back. Don’t you know?” 

“Know what?” 

“My bad luck had nothing to do with it. The 
werewolves came back because the vampires did.” 

Edward stared at me, his body motionless with 
surprise. 

“Jacob told me that your family being here set things 
in motion. I thought you would already know... .” 

His eyes narrowed. “Is that what they think?” 

“Edward, look at the facts. Seventy years ago, you 
came here, and the werewolves showed up. You come 

32 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




back now, and the werewolves show up again. Do you 
think that’s a coincidence?” 

He blinked and his glare relaxed. “Carlisle will be 
interested in that theory.” 

“Theory,” I scoffed. 

He was silent for a moment, staring out the window 
into the rain; I imagined he was contemplating the 
fact that his family’s presence was turning the locals 
into giant dogs. 

“Interesting, but not exactly relevant,” he murmured 
after a moment. “The situation remains the same.” 

I could translate that easily enough: no werewolf 
friends. 

I knew I must be patient with Edward. It wasn’t that 
he was unreasonable, it was just that he didn’t 
understand. He had no idea how very much I owed 
Jacob Black — my life many times over, and possibly 
my sanity, too. 

I didn’t like to talk about that barren time with 
anyone, and especially not Edward. He had only been 
trying to save me when he’d left, trying to save my 
soul. I didn’t hold him responsible for all the stupid 
things I’d done in his absence, or the pain I had 
suffered. 

He did. 

So I would have to word my explanation very 
carefully. 



33 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I got up and walked around the table. He opened his 
arms for me and I sat on his lap, nestling into his cool 
stone embrace. I looked at his hands while I spoke. 

“Please just listen for a minute. This is so much more 
important than some whim to drop in on an old 
friend. Jacob is in pain.” My voice distorted around 
the word. “I can’t not try to help him — I can’t give up 
on him now, when he needs me. Just because he’s 
not human all the time... . Well, he was there for me 
when I was ... not so human myself. You don’t know 
what it was like... .” I hesitated. Edward’s arms were 
rigid around me; his hands were in fists now, the 
tendons standing out. “If Jacob hadn’t helped me ... 
I’m not sure what you would have come home to. I 
owe him better than this, Edward.” 

I looked up at his face warily. His eyes were closed, 
and his jaw was strained. 

“I’ll never forgive myself for leaving you,” he 
whispered. “Not if I live a hundred thousand years.” 

I put my hand against his cold face and waited until 
he sighed and opened his eyes. 

“You were just trying to do the right thing. And I’m 
sure it would have worked with anyone less mental 
than me. Besides, you’re here now. That’s the part 
that matters.” 

“If I’d never left, you wouldn’t feel the need to go risk 
your life to comfort a dog.” 

I flinched. I was used to Jacob and all his derogatory 
slurs — bloodsucker, leech, parasite... . Somehow it 
sounded harsher in Edward’s velvet voice. 



34 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I don’t know how to phrase this properly,” Edward 
said, and his tone was bleak. “It’s going to sound 
cruel, I suppose. But I’ve come too close to losing you 
in the past. I know what it feels like to think I have. I 
am not going to tolerate anything dangerous.” 

“You have to trust me on this. I’ll be fine.” 

His face was pained again. “Please, Bella,” he 
whispered. 

I stared into his suddenly burning golden eyes. 

“Please what?” 

“Please, for me. Please make a conscious effort to 
keep yourself safe. I’ll do everything I can, but I would 
appreciate a little help.” 

“I’ll work on it,” I murmured. 

“Do you really have any idea how important you are 
to me? Any concept at all of how much I love you?” He 
pulled me tighter against his hard chest, tucking my 
head under his chin. 

I pressed my lips against his snow-cold neck. “I know 
how much I love you,” I answered. 

“You compare one small tree to the entire forest.” 

I rolled my eyes, but he couldn’t see. “Impossible.” 

He kissed the top of my head and sighed. 

“No werewolves.” 

“I’m not going along with that. I have to see Jacob.” 

“Then 111 have to stop you.” 

35 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He sounded utterly confident that this wouldn’t be a 
problem. 

I was sure he was right. 

“Well see about that,” I bluffed anyway. “He’s still my 
friend.” 

I could feel Jacob’s note in my pocket, like it suddenly 
weighed ten pounds. I could hear the words in his 
voice, and he seemed to be agreeing with Edward — 
something that would never happen in reality. 

Doesn’t change anything. Sorry. 



36 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 





I felt oddly buoyant as I walked from Spanish toward 
the cafeteria, and it wasn’t just because I was holding 
hands with the most perfect person on the planet, 
though that was certainly part of it. 

Maybe it was the knowledge that my sentence was 
served and I was a free woman again. 

Or maybe it wasn’t anything to do with me 
specifically. Maybe it was the atmosphere of freedom 
that hung over the entire campus. School was 
winding down, and, for the senior class especially, 
there was a perceptible thrill in the air. 

Freedom was so close it was touchable, taste-able. 
Signs of it were everywhere. Posters crowded together 
on the cafeteria walls, and the trashcans wore a 
colorful skirt of spilled-over fliers: reminders to buy 
yearbooks, class rings, and announcements; 
deadlines to order graduation gowns, hats, and 
tassels; neon-bright sales pitches — the juniors 
campaigning for class office; ominous, rose-wreathed 
advertisements for this year’s prom. The big dance 
was this coming weekend, but I had an ironclad 
promise from Edward that I would not be subjected to 
that again. After all, I’d already had that human 
experience. 

No, it must be my personal freedom that lightened me 
today. The ending of the school year did not give me 
the pleasure it seemed to give the other students. 
Actually, I felt nervous to the point of nausea 
whenever I thought of it. I tried to not think of it. 



37 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



But it was hard to escape such an omnipresent topic 
as graduation. 

“Have you sent your announcements, yet?” Angela 
asked when Edward and I sat down at our table. She 
had her light brown hair pulled back into a sloppy 
ponytail instead of her usual smooth hairdo, and 
there was a slightly frantic look about her eyes. 

Alice and Ben were already there, too, on either side 
of Angela. Ben was intent over a comic book, his 
glasses sliding down his narrow nose. Alice was 
scrutinizing my boring jeans-and-a-t-shirt outfit in a 
way that made me self-conscious. Probably plotting 
another makeover. I sighed. My indifferent attitude to 
fashion was a constant thorn in her side. If I’d allow 
it, she’d love to dress me every day — perhaps several 
times a day — like some oversized three-dimensional 
paper doll. 

“No,” I answered Angela. “There’s no point, really. 
Renee knows when I’m graduating. Who else is 
there?” 

“How about you, Alice?” 

Alice smiled. “All done.” 

“Lucky you.” Angela sighed. “My mother has a 
thousand cousins and she expects me to hand- 
address one to everybody. I’m going to get carpal 
tunnel. I can’t put it off any longer and I’m just 
dreading it.” 

“I’ll help you,” I volunteered. “If you don’t mind my 
awful handwriting.” 

Charlie would like that. From the corner of my eye, I 
saw Edward smile. He must like that, too — me 

38 | Page Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




fulfilling Charlie’s conditions without involving 
werewolves. 

Angela looked relieved. “That’s so nice of you. I’ll come 
over any time you want.” 

“Actually, I’d rather go to your house if that’s okay — 
I’m sick of mine. Charlie un-grounded me last night.” 

I grinned as I announced my good news. 

“Really?” Angela asked, mild excitement lighting her 
always-gentle brown eyes. “I thought you said you 
were in for life.” 

“I’m more surprised than you are. I was sure I would 
at least have finished high school before he set me 
free.” 

“Well, this is great, Bella! We’ll have to go out to 
celebrate.” 

“You have no idea how good that sounds.” 

“What should we do?” Alice mused, her face lighting 
up at the possibilities. Alice’s ideas were usually a 
little grandiose for me, and I could see it in her eyes 
now — the tendency to take things too far kicking 
into action. 

“Whatever you’re thinking, Alice, I doubt I’m that 
free.” 

“Free is free, right?” she insisted. 

“I’m sure I still have boundaries — like the 
continental U.S., for example.” 

Angela and Ben laughed, but Alice grimaced in real 
disappointment. 

39 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“So what are we doing tonight?” she persisted. 

“Nothing. Look, let’s give it a couple of days to make 
sure he wasn’t joking. It’s a school night, anyway.” 

“Well celebrate this weekend, then.” Alice’s 
enthusiasm was impossible to repress. 

“Sure,” I said, hoping to placate her. I knew I wasn’t 
going to do anything too outlandish; it would be safer 
to take it slow with Charlie. Give him a chance to 
appreciate how trustworthy and mature I was before I 
asked for any favors. 

Angela and Alice started talking about options; Ben 
joined the conversation, setting his comics aside. My 
attention drifted. I was surprised to find that the 
subject of my freedom was suddenly not as gratifying 
as it had been just a moment ago. While they 
discussed things to do in Port Angeles or maybe 
Hoquiam, I began to feel disgruntled. 

It didn’t take long to determine where my restlessness 
stemmed from. 

Ever since I’d said goodbye to Jacob Black in the 
forest outside my home, I’d been plagued by a 
persistent, uncomfortable intrusion of a specific 
mental picture. It popped into my thoughts at regular 
intervals like some annoying alarm clock set to sound 
every half hour, filling my head with the image of 
Jacob’s face crumpled in pain. This was the last 
memory I had of him. 

As the disturbing vision struck again, I knew exactly 
why I was dissatisfied with my liberty. Because it was 
incomplete.

Sure, I was free to go to anywhere I wanted — except 
La Push; free to do anything I wanted — except see 
Jacob. I frowned at the table. There had to be some 
kind of middle ground. 

“Alice? Alice!” 

Angela’s voice yanked me from my reverie. She was 
waving her hand back and forth in front of Alice’s 
blank, staring face. Alice’s expression was something 
I recognized — an expression that sent an automatic 
shock of panic through my body. The vacant look in 
her eyes told me that she was seeing something very 
different from the mundane lunchroom scene that 
surrounded us, but something that was every bit as 
real in its own way. Something that was coming, 
something that would happen soon. I felt the blood 
slither from my face. 

Then Edward laughed, a very natural, relaxed sound. 
Angela and Ben looked toward him, but my eyes were 
locked on Alice. She jumped suddenly, as if someone 
had kicked her under the table. 

“Is it naptime already, Alice?” Edward teased. 

Alice was herself again. “Sorry, I was daydreaming, I 
guess.” 

“Daydreaming’s better than facing two more hours of 
school,” Ben said. 

Alice threw herself back into the conversation with 
more animation than before — just a little bit too 
much. Once I saw her eyes lock with Edward’s, only 
for a moment, and then she looked back to Angela 
before anyone else noticed. Edward was quiet, playing 
absentmindedly with a strand of my hair.

I waited anxiously for a chance to ask Edward what 
Alice had seen in her vision, but the afternoon passed 
without one minute of alone time. 

It felt odd to me, almost deliberate. After lunch, 
Edward slowed his pace to match Ben’s, talking about 
some assignment I knew he’d already finished. Then 
there was always someone else there between classes, 
though we usually had a few minutes to ourselves. 
When the final bell rang, Edward struck up a 
conversation with Mike Newton of all people, falling 
into step beside him as Mike headed for the parking 
lot. I trailed behind, letting Edward tow me along. 

I listened, confused, while Mike answered Edward’s 
unusually friendly queries. It seemed Mike was 
having car troubles. 

"... but I just replaced the battery,” Mike was saying. 
His eyes darted ahead and then back to Edward 
warily. Mystified, just like I was. 

“Perhaps it’s the cables?” Edward offered. 

“Maybe. I really don’t know anything about cars,” 

Mike admitted. “I need to have someone look at it, but 
I can’t afford to take it to Dowling’s.” 

I opened my mouth to suggest my mechanic, and 
then snapped it shut again. My mechanic was busy 
these days — busy running around as a giant wolf. 

“I know a few things — I could take a look, if you 
like,” Edward offered. “Just let me drop Alice and 
Bella at home.” 

Mike and I both stared at Edward with our mouths 
hanging open. 



42 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Er ... thanks,” Mike mumbled when he recovered. 
“But I have to get to work. Maybe some other time.” 

“Absolutely.” 

“See ya.” Mike climbed into his car, shaking his head 
in disbelief. 

Edward’s Volvo, with Alice already inside, was just 
two cars away. 

“What was that about?” I muttered as Edward held 
the passenger door for me. 

“Just being helpful,” Edward answered. 

And then Alice, waiting in the backseat, was babbling 
at top speed. 

“You’re really not that good a mechanic, Edward. 
Maybe you should have Rosalie take a look at it 
tonight, just so you look good if Mike decides to let 
you help, you know. Not that it wouldn’t be fun to 
watch his face if Rosalie showed up to help. But since 
Rosalie is supposed to be across the country 
attending college, I guess that’s not the best idea. Too 
bad. Though I suppose, for Mike’s car, you’ll do. It’s 
only within the finer tunings of a good Italian sports 
car that you’re out of your depth. And speaking of 
Italy and sports cars that I stole there, you still owe 
me a yellow Porsche. I don’t know that I want to wait 
for Christmas... .” 

I stopped listening after a minute, letting her quick 
voice become just a hum in the background as I 
settled into my patient mode. 



43 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




It looked to me like Edward was trying to avoid my 
questions. Fine. He would have to be alone with me 
soon enough. It was only a matter of time. 

Edward seemed to realize that, too. He dropped Alice 
at the mouth of the Cullens’ drive as usual, though by 
this point I half expected him to drive her to the door 
and walk her in. 

As she got out, Alice threw a sharp look at his face. 
Edward seemed completely at ease. 

“See you later,” he said. And then, ever so slightly, he 
nodded. 

Alice turned to disappear into the trees. 

He was quiet as he turned the car around and headed 
back to Forks. I waited, wondering if he would bring it 
up himself. He didn’t, and this made me tense. What 
had Alice seen today at lunch? Something he didn’t 
want to tell me, and I tried to think of a reason why 
he would keep secrets. Maybe it would be better to 
prepare myself before I asked. I didn’t want to freak 
out and have him think I couldn’t handle it, whatever 
it was. 

So we were both silent until we got to back to 
Charlie’s house. 

“Light homework load tonight,” he commented. 
“Mmm,” I assented. 

“Do you suppose I’m allowed inside again?” 

“Charlie didn’t throw a fit when you picked me up for 
school.” 



44 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




But I was sure Charlie was going to turn sulky fast 
when he got home and found Edward here. Maybe I 
should make something extra-special for dinner. 

Inside, I headed up the stairs, and Edward followed. 
He lounged on my bed and gazed out the window, 
seeming oblivious to my edginess. 

I stowed my bag and turned the computer on. There 
was an unanswered e-mail from my mom to attend to, 
and she got panicky when I took too long. I drummed 
my fingers as I waited for my decrepit computer to 
wheeze awake; they snapped against the desk, 
staccato and anxious. 

And then his fingers were on mine, holding them still. 

“Are we a little impatient today?” he murmured. 

I looked up, intending to make a sarcastic remark, 
but his face was closer than I’d expected. His golden 
eyes were smoldering, just inches away, and his 
breath was cool against my open lips. I could taste his 
scent on my tongue. 

I couldn’t remember the witty response I’d been about 
to make. I couldn’t remember my name. 

He didn’t give me a chance to recover. 

If I had my way, I would spend the majority of my 
time kissing Edward. There wasn’t anything I’d 
experienced in my life that compared to the feeling of 
his cool lips, marble hard but always so gentle, 
moving with mine. 

I didn’t often get my way. 



45 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




So it surprised me a little when his fingers braided 
themselves into my hair, securing my face to his. My 
arms locked behind his neck, and I wished I was 
stronger — strong enough to keep him prisoner here. 
One hand slid down my back, pressing me tighter 
against his stone chest. Even through his sweater, his 
skin was cold enough to make me shiver — it was a 
shiver of pleasure, of happiness, but his hands began 
to loosen in response. 

I knew I had about three seconds before he would 
sigh and slide me deftly away, saying something 
about how we’d risked my life enough for one 
afternoon. Making the most of my last seconds, I 
crushed myself closer, molding myself to the shape of 
him. The tip of my tongue traced the curve of his 
lower lip; it was as flawlessly smooth as if it had been 
polished, and the taste — 

He pulled my face away from his, breaking my hold 
with ease — he probably didn’t even realize that I was 
using all my strength. 

He chuckled once, a low, throaty sound. His eyes 
were bright with the excitement he so rigidly 
disciplined. 

“Ah, Bella.” He sighed. 

“I’d say I’m sorry, but I’m not.” 

“And I should feel sorry that you’re not sorry, but I 
don’t. Maybe I should go sit on the bed.” 

I exhaled a little dizzily. “If you think that’s 
necessary... .” 

He smiled crookedly and disentangled himself. 



46 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I shook my head a few times, trying to clear it, and 
turned back to my computer. It was all warmed up 
and humming now. Well, not as much humming as 
groaning. 

“Tell Renee I said hello.” 

“Sure thing.” 

I scanned through Renee’s e-mail, shaking my head 
now and then at some of the dippier things she’d 
done. I was just as entertained and horrified as the 
first time I’d read this. It was so like my mother to 
forget exactly how paralyzed she was by heights until 
she was already strapped to a parachute and a dive 
instructor. I felt a little frustrated with Phil, her 
husband of almost two years, for allowing that one. I 
would have taken better care of her. I knew her so 
much better. 

You have to let them go their own way eventually, I 
reminded myself. You have to let them have their own 
life... . 

I’d spent most of my life taking care of Renee, 
patiently guiding her away from her craziest plans, 
good-naturedly enduring the ones I couldn’t talk her 
out of. I’d always been indulgent with my mom, 
amused by her, even a little condescending to her. I 
saw her cornucopia of mistakes and laughed privately 
to myself. Scatterbrained Renee. 

I was a very different person from my mother. 

Someone thoughtful and cautious. The responsible 
one, the grown-up. That’s how I saw myself. That was 
the person I knew. 

With the blood still pounding in my head from 
Edward’s kiss, I couldn’t help but think of my 

47 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




mother’s most life-altering mistake. Silly and 
romantic, getting married fresh out of high school to a 
man she barely knew, then producing me a year later. 
She’d always promised me that she had no regrets, 
that I was the best gift her life had ever given her. And 
yet she’d drilled it into me over and over — smart 
people took marriage seriously. Mature people went to 
college and started careers before they got deeply 
involved in a relationship. She knew I would never be 
as thoughtless and goofy and small-town as she’d 
been... . 

I gritted my teeth and tried to concentrate as I 
answered her letter. 

Then I hit her parting line and remembered why I’d 
neglected to write sooner. 

You haven’t said anything about Jacob in a long time, 
she’d written. What’s he up to these days? 

Charlie was prompting her, I was sure. 

I sighed and typed quickly, tucking the answer to her 
question between two less sensitive paragraphs. 

Jacob is fine, I guess. I don’t see him much; he 
spends most of his time with a pack of his friends 
down at La Push these days. 

Smiling wryly to myself, I added Edward’s greeting 
and hit “send.” 

I didn’t realize that Edward was standing silently 
behind me again until after I’d turned off the 
computer and shoved away from the desk. I was 
about to scold him for reading over my shoulder when 
I realized that he wasn’t paying any attention to me. 
He was examining a flat black box with wires curling 
48 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




crookedly away from the main square in a way that 
didn’t look healthy for whatever it was. After a 
second, I recognized the car stereo Emmett, Rosalie, 
and Jasper had given me for my last birthday. I’d 
forgotten about the birthday presents hiding under a 
growing pile of dust on the floor of my closet. 

“What did you do to this?” he asked in a horrorstruck 
voice. 

“It didn’t want to come out of the dashboard.” 

“So you felt the need to torture it?” 

“You know how I am with tools. No pain was inflicted 
intentionally.” 

He shook his head, his face a mask of faux tragedy. 
“You killed it.” 

I shrugged. “Oh, well.” 

“It would hurt their feelings if they saw this,” he said. 
“I guess it’s a good thing that you’ve been on house 
arrest. I’ll have to get another one in place before they 
notice.” 

“Thanks, but I don’t need a fancy stereo.” 

“It’s not for your sake that I’m going to replace it.” 

I sighed. 

“You didn’t get much good out of your birthday 
presents last year,” he said in a disgruntled voice. 
Suddenly, he was fanning himself with a stiff 
rectangle of paper. 



49 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I didn’t answer, for fear my voice would shake. My 
disastrous eighteenth birthday — with all its far- 
reaching consequences — wasn’t something I cared to 
remember, and I was surprised that he would bring it 
up. He was even more sensitive about it than I was. 

“Do you realize these are about to expire?” he asked, 
holding the paper out to me. It was another present 
— the voucher for airplane tickets that Esme and 
Carlisle had given me so that I could visit Renee in 
Florida. 

I took a deep breath and answered in a flat voice. “No. 
I’d forgotten all about them, actually.” 

His expression was carefully bright and positive; there 
was no trace of any deep emotion as he continued. 
“Well, we still have a little time. You’ve been liberated 
. . . and we have no plans this weekend, as you refuse 
to go to the prom with me.” He grinned. “Why not 
celebrate your freedom this way?” 

I gasped. “By going to Florida?” 

“You did say something about the continental U.S. 
being allowable.” 

I glared at him, suspicious, trying to understand 
where this had come from. 

“Well?” he demanded. “Are we going to see Renee or 
not?” 

“Charlie will never allow it.” 

“Charlie can’t keep you from visiting your mother. 

She still has primary custody.” 

“Nobody has custody of me. I’m an adult.” 

50 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




He flashed a brilliant smile. “Exactly.” 



I thought it over for a short minute before deciding 
that it wasn’t worth the fight. Charlie would be 
furious — not that I was going to see Renee, but that 
Edward was going with me. Charlie wouldn’t speak to 
me for months, and I’d probably end up grounded 
again. It was definitely smarter not to even bring it 
up. Maybe in a few weeks, as a graduation favor or 
something. 

But the idea of seeing my mother now, not weeks 
from now, was hard to resist. It had been so long 
since I’d seen Renee. And even longer since I’d seen 
her under pleasant circumstances. The last time I’d 
been with her in Phoenix, I’d spent the whole time in 
a hospital bed. The last time she’d come here, I’d been 
more or less catatonic. Not exactly the best memories 
to leave her with. 

And maybe, if she saw how happy I was with Edward, 
she would tell Charlie to ease up. 

Edward scrutinized my face while I deliberated. 

I sighed. “Not this weekend.” 

“Why not?” 

“I don’t want to fight with Charlie. Not so soon after 
he’s forgiven me.” 

His eyebrows pulled together. “I think this weekend is 
perfect,” he muttered. 

I shook my head. “Another time.” 

“You aren’t the only one who’s been trapped in this 
house, you know.” He frowned at me. 

51 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




Suspicion returned. This kind of behavior was unlike 
him. He was always so impossibly selfless; I knew it 
was making me spoiled. 

“You can go anywhere you want,” I pointed out. 

“The outside world holds no interest for me without 
you.” 

I rolled my eyes at the hyperbole. 

“I’m serious,” he said. 

“Let’s take the outside world slowly, all right? For 
example, we could start with a movie in Port 
Angeles... .” 

He groaned. “Never mind. We’ll talk about it later.” 
“There’s nothing left to talk about.” 

He shrugged. 

“Okay, then, new subject,” I said. I’d almost forgotten 
my worries about this afternoon — had that been his 
intention? “What did Alice see today at lunch?” 

My eyes were fixed on his face as I spoke, measuring 
his reaction. 

His expression was composed; there was only the 
slightest hardening of his topaz eyes. “She’s been 
seeing Jasper in a strange place, somewhere in the 
southwest, she thinks, near his former ... family. But 
he has no conscious intentions to go back.” He 
sighed. “It’s got her worried.” 

“Oh.” That was nothing close to what I’d been 
expecting. But of course it made sense that Alice 

52 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




would be watching out for Jasper’s future. He was her 
soul mate, her true other half, though they weren’t as 
flamboyant about their relationship as Rosalie and 
Emmett were. “Why didn’t you tell me before?” 

“I didn’t realize you’d noticed,” he said. “It’s probably 
nothing important, in any case.” 

My imagination was sadly out of control. I’d taken a 
perfectly normal afternoon and twisted it until it 
looked like Edward was going out of his way to keep 
things from me. I needed therapy. 

We went downstairs to work on our homework, just in 
case Charlie showed up early. Edward finished in 
minutes; I slogged laboriously through my calculus 
until I decided it was time to fix Charlie’s dinner. 
Edward helped, making faces every so often at the 
raw ingredients — human food was mildly repulsive 
to him. I made stroganoff from Grandma Swan’s 
recipe, because I was sucking up. It wasn’t one of my 
favorites, but it would please Charlie. 

Charlie seemed to already be in a good mood when he 
got home. He didn’t even go out of his way to be rude 
to Edward. Edward excused himself from eating with 
us, as usual. The sound of the nightly news drifted 
from the front room, but I doubted Edward was really 
watching. 

After forcing down three helpings, Charlie kicked his 
feet up on the spare chair and folded his hands 
contentedly across his distended stomach. 

“That was great, Bells.” 

“I’m glad you liked it. How was work?” He’d been 
eating with too much concentration for me to make 
conversation before. 

53 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Sort of slow. Well, dead slow really. Mark and I 
played cards for a good part of the afternoon,” he 
admitted with a grin. “I won, nineteen hands to seven. 
And then I was on the phone with Billy for a while.” 

I tried to keep my expression the same. “How is he?” 

“Good, good. His joints are bothering him a little.” 

“Oh. That’s too bad.” 

“Yeah. He invited us down to visit this weekend. He 
was thinking of having the Clearwaters and the Uleys 
over too. Sort of a playoff party... .” 

“Huh,” was my genius response. But what could I 
say? I knew I wouldn’t be allowed to hit a werewolf 
party, even with parental supervision. I wondered if 
Edward would have a problem with Charlie hanging 
out in La Push. Or would he suppose that, since 
Charlie was mostly spending time with Billy, who was 
only human, my father wouldn’t be in danger? 

I got up and piled the dishes together without looking 
at Charlie. I dumped them into the sink and started 
the water. Edward appeared silently and grabbed a 
dishtowel. 

Charlie sighed and gave up for the moment, though I 
imagined he would revisit the subject when we were 
alone again. He heaved himself to his feet and headed 
for the TV, just like every other night. 

“Charlie,” Edward said in a conversational tone. 

Charlie stopped in the middle of his little kitchen. 
“Yeah?” 



54 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Did Bella ever tell you that my parents gave her 
airplane tickets on her last birthday, so that she 
could visit Renee?” 

I dropped the plate I was scrubbing. It glanced off the 
counter and clattered noisily to the floor. It didn’t 
break, but it spattered the room, and all three of us, 
with soapy water. Charlie didn’t even seem to notice. 

“Bella?” he asked in a stunned voice. 

I kept my eyes on the plate as I retrieved it. “Yeah, 
they did.” 

Charlie swallowed loudly, and then his eyes narrowed 
as he turned back to Edward. “No, she never 
mentioned it.” 

“Hmm,” Edward murmured. 

“Was there a reason you brought it up?” Charlie 
asked in a hard voice. 

Edward shrugged. “They’re about to expire. I think it 
might hurt Esme’s feelings if Bella doesn’t use her 
gift. Not that she’d say anything.” 

I stared at Edward in disbelief. 

Charlie thought for a minute. “It’s probably a good 
idea for you to visit your mom, Bella. She’d love that. 
I’m surprised you didn’t say anything about this, 
though.” 

“I forgot,” I admitted. 

He frowned. “You forgot that someone gave you plane 
tickets?” 



55 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Mmm,” I murmured vaguely, and turned back to the 
sink. 

“I noticed that you said they’re about to expire, 
Edward,” Charlie went on. “How many tickets did 
your parents give her?” 

“Just one for her ... and one for me.” 

The plate I dropped this time landed in the sink, so it 
didn’t make as much noise. I could easily hear the 
sharp huff as my father exhaled. The blood rushed 
into my face, fueled by irritation and chagrin. Why 
was Edward doing this? I glared at the bubbles in the 
sink, panicking. 

“That’s out of the question!” Charlie was abruptly in a 
rage, shouting the words. 

“Why?” Edward asked, his voice saturated with 
innocent surprise. “You just said it was a good idea 
for her to see her mother.” 

Charlie ignored him. “You’re not going anywhere with 
him, young lady!” he yelled. I spun around and he 
was jabbing a finger at me. 

Anger pulsed through me automatically, an 
instinctive reaction to his tone. 

“I’m not a child, Dad. And I’m not grounded anymore, 
remember?” 

“Oh yes, you are. Starting now.” 

“For what?!” 

“Because I said so.” 



56 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Do I need to remind you that I’m a legal adult, 
Charlie?” 



“This is my house — you follow my rules!” 

My glare turned icy. “If that’s how you want it. Do you 
want me to move out tonight? Or can I have a few 
days to pack?” 

Charlie’s face went bright red. I instantly felt horrible 
for playing the move-out card. 

I took a deep breath and tried to make my tone more 
reasonable. “I’ll do my time without complaining when 
I’ve done something wrong, Dad, but I’m not going to 
put up with your prejudices.” 

He sputtered, but managed nothing coherent. 

“Now, I know that you know that I have every right to 
see Mom for the weekend. You can’t honestly tell me 
you’d object to the plan if I was going with Alice or 
Angela.” 

“Girls,” he grunted, with a nod. 

“Would it bother you if I took Jacob?” 

I’d only picked the name because I knew of my 
father’s preference for Jacob, but I quickly wished I 
hadn’t; Edward’s teeth clenched together with an 
audible snap. 

My father struggled to compose himself before he 
answered. “Yes,” he said in an unconvincing voice. 
“That would bother me.” 

“You’re a rotten liar, Dad.” 



57 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Bella — ” 



“It’s not like I’m headed off to Vegas to be a showgirl 
or anything. I’m going to see Mom,” I reminded him. 
“She’s just as much my parental authority as you 
are.” 

He threw me a withering look. 

“Are you implying something about Mom’s ability to 
look after me?” 

Charlie flinched at the threat implicit in my question. 

“You’d better hope I don’t mention this to her,” I said. 

“You’d better not,” he warned. “I’m not happy about 
this, Bella.” 

“There’s no reason for you to be upset.” 

He rolled his eyes, but I could tell the storm was over. 

I turned to pull the plug out of the sink. “So my 
homework is done, your dinner is done, the dishes 
are done, and I’m not grounded. I’m going out. I’ll be 
back before ten-thirty.” 

“Where are you going?” His face, almost back to 
normal, flushed light red again. 

“I’m not sure,” I admitted. “I’ll keep it within a ten- 
mile radius, though. Okay?” 

He grunted something that did not sound like 
approval, and stalked out of the room. Naturally, as 
soon as I’d won the fight, I began to feel guilty.

“We’re going out?” Edward asked, his voice low but 
enthusiastic. 

I turned to glower at him. “Yes. I think I’d like to 
speak to you alone.” 

He didn’t look as apprehensive as I thought he 
should. 

I waited to begin until we were safely in his car. 
“What was that?” I demanded. 

“I know you want to see your mother, Bella — you’ve 
been talking about her in your sleep. Worrying 
actually.” 

“I have?” 

He nodded. “But, clearly, you were too much of a 
coward to deal with Charlie, so I interceded on your 
behalf.” 

“Interceded? You threw me to the sharks!” 

He rolled his eyes. “I don’t think you were in any 
danger.” 

“I told you I didn’t want to fight with Charlie.” 
“Nobody said that you had to.” 

I glowered at him. “I can’t help myself when he gets 
all bossy like that — my natural teenage instincts 
overpower me.” 

He chuckled. “Well, that’s not my fault.”

I stared at him, speculating. He didn’t seem to notice. 
His face was serene as he gazed out the windshield. 
Something was off, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. 
Or maybe it was just my imagination again, running 
wild like it had this afternoon. 

“Does this sudden urge to see Florida have anything 
to do with the party at Billy’s place?” 

His jaw flexed. “Nothing at all. It wouldn’t matter if 
you were here or on the other side of the world, you 
still wouldn’t be going.” 

It was just like with Charlie before — just like being 
treated as a misbehaving child. I gritted my teeth 
together so I wouldn’t start shouting. I didn’t want to 
fight with Edward, too. 

Edward sighed, and when he spoke his voice was 
warm and velvet again. “So what do you want to do 
tonight?” he asked. 

“Can we go to your house? I haven’t seen Esme in so 
long.” 

He smiled. “She’ll like that. Especially when she hears 
what we’re doing this weekend.” 

I groaned in defeat. 

We didn’t stay out late, as I’d promised. I was not 
surprised to see the lights still on when we pulled up 
in front of the house — I knew Charlie would be 
waiting to yell at me some more. 

“You’d better not come inside,” I said. “It will only 
make things worse.”

“His thoughts are relatively calm,” Edward teased. His 
expression made me wonder if there was some 
additional joke I was missing. The corners of his 
mouth twitched, fighting a smile. 

“I’ll see you later,” I muttered glumly. 

He laughed and kissed the top of my head. “I’ll be 
back when Charlie’s snoring.” 

The TV was loud when I got inside. I briefly 
considered trying to sneak past him. 

“Could you come in here, Bella?” Charlie called, 
sinking that plan. 

My feet dragged as I took the five necessary steps. 
“What’s up, Dad?” 

“Did you have a nice time tonight?” he asked. He 
seemed ill at ease. I looked for hidden meanings in his 
words before I answered. 

“Yes,” I said hesitantly. 

“What did you do?” 

I shrugged. “Hung out with Alice and Jasper. Edward 
beat Alice at chess, and then I played Jasper. He 
buried me.” 

I smiled. Edward and Alice playing chess was one of 
the funniest things I’d ever seen. They’d sat there 
nearly motionless, staring at the board, while Alice 
foresaw the moves he would make and he picked the 
moves she would make in return out of her head. 

They played most of the game in their minds; I think 
they’d each moved two pawns when Alice suddenly

flicked her king over and surrendered. It took all of 
three minutes. 

Charlie hit the mute button — an unusual action. 

“Look, there’s something I need to say.” He frowned, 
looking very uncomfortable. 

I sat still, waiting. He met my gaze for a second before 
shifting his eyes to the floor. He didn’t say anything 
more. 

“What is it, Dad?” 

He sighed. “I’m not good at this kind of thing. I don’t 
know how to start... .” 

I waited again. 

“Okay, Bella. Here’s the thing.” He got up from the 
couch and started pacing back and forth across the 
room, looking as his feet all the time. “You and 
Edward seem pretty serious, and there are some 
things that you need to be careful about. I know 
you’re an adult now, but you’re still young, Bella, and 
there are a lot of important things you need to know 
when you ... well, when you’re physically involved 
with — ” 

“Oh, please, please no!” I begged, jumping to my feet. 
“Please tell me you are not trying to have a sex talk 
with me, Charlie.” 

He glared at the floor. “I am your father. I have 
responsibilities. Remember, I’m just as embarrassed 
as you are.”

“I don’t think that’s humanly possible. Anyway, Mom 
beat you to the punch about ten years ago. You’re off 
the hook.” 

“Ten years ago you didn’t have a boyfriend,” he 
muttered unwillingly. I could tell he was battling with 
his desire to drop the subject. We were both standing 
up, looking at the floor, and facing away from each 
other. 

“I don’t think the essentials have changed that 
much,” I mumbled, and my face had to be as red as 
his. This was beyond the seventh circle of Hades; 
even worse was realizing that Edward had known this 
was coming. No wonder he’d seemed so smug in the 
car. 

“Just tell me that you two are being responsible,” 
Charlie pled, obviously wishing a pit would open in 
the floor so that he could fall in. 

“Don’t worry about it, Dad, it’s not like that.” 

“Not that I don’t trust you, Bella, but I know you don’t 
want to tell me anything about this, and you know I 
don’t really want to hear it. I will try to be open- 
minded, though. I know the times have changed.” 

I laughed awkwardly. “Maybe the times have, but 
Edward is very old-fashioned. You have nothing to 
worry about.” 

Charlie sighed. “Sure he is,” he muttered. 

“Ugh!” I groaned. “I really wish you were not forcing 
me to say this out loud, Dad. Really. But ... I am a ... 
virgin, and I have no immediate plans to change that 
status.” 



63 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




We both cringed, but then Charlie’s face smoothed 
out. He seemed to believe me. 



“Can I go to bed, now? Please.” 

“In a minute,” he said. 

“Aw, please, Dad? I’m begging you.” 

“The embarrassing part’s over, I promise,” he assured 
me. 

I shot a glance at him, and was grateful to see that he 
looked more relaxed, that his face was back to its 
regular color. He sank down onto the sofa, sighing 
with relief that he was past the sex speech. 

“What now?” 

“I just wanted to know how the balance thing is 
coming along.” 

“Oh. Good, I guess. I made plans with Angela today. 
I’m going to help her with her graduation 
announcements. Just us girls.” 

“That’s nice. And what about Jake?” 

I sighed. “I haven’t figured that one out yet, Dad.” 

“Keep trying, Bella. I know you’ll do the right thing. 
You’re a good person.” 

Nice. So if I didn’t figure out some way to make things 
right with Jacob, then I was a bad person? That was 
below the belt. 

“Sure, sure,” I agreed. The automatic response almost 
made me smile — it was something I’d picked up from 

64 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jacob. I even said it in the same patronizing tone he 
used with his own father. 



Charlie grinned and turned the sound back on. He 
slumped lower into the cushions, pleased with his 
night’s work. I could tell he would be up with the 
game for a while. 

“’Night, Bells.” 

“See you in the morning!” I sprinted for the stairs. 

Edward was long gone and he wouldn’t be back until 
Charlie was asleep — he was probably out hunting or 
something to pass the time — so I was in no hurry to 
undress for bed. I wasn’t in the mood to be alone, but 
I certainly wasn’t going to go back downstairs to hang 
out with my Dad, just in case he thought of some 
topic of sex education that he hadn’t touched on 
before; I shuddered. 

So, thanks to Charlie, I was wound up and anxious. 
My homework was done and I didn’t feel mellow 
enough for reading or just listening to music. I 
considered calling Renee with the news of my visit, 
but then I realized that it was three hours later in 
Florida, and she would be asleep. 

I could call Angela, I supposed. 

But suddenly I knew that it wasn’t Angela that I 
wanted to talk to. That I needed to talk to. 

I stared at the blank black window, biting my lip. I 
don’t know how long I stood there weighing the pros 
against the cons — doing the right thing by Jacob, 
seeing my closest friend again, being a good person, 
versus making Edward furious with me. Ten minutes 
maybe. Long enough to decide that the pros were 
65 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




valid while the cons were not. Edward was only 
concerned about my safety, and I knew that there was 
really no problem on that count. 

The phone wasn’t any help; Jacob had refused to 
answer my phone calls since Edward’s return. 

Besides, I needed to see him — see him smiling again 
the way he used to. I needed to replace that awful last 
memory of his face warped and twisted by pain if I 
was ever going to have any peace of mind. 

I had an hour probably. I could make a quick run 
down to La Push and be back before Edward realized 
I had gone. It was past my curfew, but would Charlie 
really care about that when Edward wasn’t involved? 
One way to find out. 

I grabbed my jacket and shoved my arms through the 
sleeves as I ran down the stairs. 

Charlie looked up from the game, instantly 
suspicious. 

“You care if I go see Jake tonight?” I asked 
breathlessly. “I won’t stay long.” 

As soon as I said Jake’s name, Charlie’s expression 
relaxed into a smug smile. He didn’t seem surprised 
at all that his lecture had taken effect so quickly. 
“Sure, kid. No problem. Stay as long as you like.” 

“Thanks, Dad,” I said as I darted out the door. 

Like any fugitive, I couldn’t help looking over my 
shoulder a few times while I jogged to my truck, but 
the night was so black that there really was no point. 

I had to feel my way along the side of the truck to the 
handle. 



66 | P a g e

My eyes were just beginning to adjust as I shoved my 
keys in the ignition. I twisted them hard to the left, 
but instead of roaring deafeningly to life, the engine 
just clicked. I tried it again with the same results. 

And then a small motion in my peripheral vision 
made me jump. 

“Gah!” I gasped in shock when I saw that I was not 
alone in the cab. 

Edward sat very still, a faint bright spot in the 
darkness, only his hands moving as he turned a 
mysterious black object around and around. He 
stared at the object as he spoke. 

“Alice called,” he murmured. 

Alice! Damn. I’d forgotten to account for her in my 
plans. He must have her watching me. 

“She got nervous when your future rather abruptly 
disappeared five minutes ago.” 

My eyes, already wide with surprise, popped wider. 

“Because she can’t see the wolves, you know,” he 
explained in the same low murmur. “Had you 
forgotten that? When you decide to mingle your fate 
with theirs, you disappear, too. You couldn’t know 
that part, I realize that. But can you understand why 
that might make me a little . . . anxious? Alice saw you 
disappear, and she couldn’t even tell if you’d come 
home or not. Your future got lost, just like theirs. 

“We’re not sure why this is. Some natural defense 
they’re born with?” He spoke as if he were talking to 
himself now, still looking at the piece of my truck’s 
engine as he twirled it in his hands. “That doesn’t

seem entirely likely, since I haven’t had any trouble 
reading their thoughts. The Blacks’ at least. Carlisle 
theorizes that it’s because their lives are so ruled by 
their transformations. It’s more an involuntary 
reaction than a decision. Utterly unpredictable, and it 
changes everything about them. In that instant when 
they shift from one form to the other, they don’t really 
even exist. The future can’t hold them... .” 

I listened to his musing in stony silence. 

“I’ll put your car back together in time for school, in 
case you’d like to drive yourself,” he assured me after 
a minute. 

With my lips mashed together, I retrieved my keys 
and stiffly climbed out of the truck. 

“Shut your window if you want me to stay away 
tonight. I’ll understand,” he whispered just before I 
slammed the door. 

I stomped into the house, slamming that door, too. 
“What’s wrong?” Charlie demanded from the couch. 
“Truck won’t start,” I growled. 

“Want me to look at it?” 

“No. I’ll try it in the morning.” 

“Want to use my car?” 

I wasn’t supposed to drive his police cruiser. Charlie 
must be really desperate to get me to La Push. Nearly 
as desperate as I was. 

“No. I’m tired,” I grumbled. “’Night.” 

68 | Page Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I stamped my way up the stairs, and went straight to 
my window. I shoved the metal frame roughly — it 
crashed shut and the glass trembled. 

I stared at the shivering black glass for a long 
moment, until it was still. Then I sighed, and opened 
the window as wide as it would go.

The sun was so deeply buried behind the clouds that 
there was no way to tell if it had set or not. After the 
long flight — chasing the sun westward so that it 
seemed unmoving in the sky — it was especially 
disorienting; time seemed oddly variable. It took me 
by surprise when the forest gave way to the first 
buildings, signaling that we were nearly home. 

“You’ve been very quiet,” Edward observed. “Did the 
plane make you sick?” 

“No, I’m okay.” 

“Are you sad to leave?” 

“More relieved than sad, I think.” 

He raised one eyebrow at me. I knew it was useless 
and — much as I hated to admit it — unnecessary to 
ask him to keep his eyes on the road. 

“Renee is so much more ... perceptive than Charlie in 
some ways. It was making me jumpy.” 

Edward laughed. “Your mother has a very interesting 
mind. Almost childlike, but very insightful. She sees 
things differently than other people.” 

Insightful. It was a good description of my mother — 
when she was paying attention. Most of the time 
Renee was so bewildered by her own life that she 
didn’t notice much else. But this weekend she’d been 
paying plenty of attention to me. 



70 | Page 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



Phil was busy — the high school baseball team he 
coached was in the playoffs — and being alone with 
Edward and me had only sharpened Renee’s focus. As 
soon as the hugs and squeals of delight were out of 
the way, Renee began to watch. And as she’d 
watched, her wide blue eyes had become first 
confused and then concerned. 

This morning we’d gone for a walk along the beach. 
She wanted to show off all the beauties of her new 
home, still hoping, I think, that the sun might lure 
me away from Forks. She’d also wanted to talk with 
me alone, and that was easily arranged. Edward had 
fabricated a term paper to give himself an excuse to 
stay indoors during the day. 

In my head, I went through the conversation again... . 

Renee and I ambled along the sidewalk, trying to stay 
in the range of the infrequent palm tree shadows. 
Though it was early, the heat was smothering. The air 
was so heavy with moisture that just breathing in and 
out was giving my lungs a workout. 

“Bella?” my mother asked, looking out past the sand 
to the lightly crashing waves as she spoke. 

“What is it, Mom?” 

She sighed, not meeting my gaze. “I’m worried... .” 

“What’s wrong?” I asked, anxious at once. “What can I 
do?” 

“It’s not me.” She shook her head. “I’m worried about 
you ... and Edward.” 

Renee finally looked at me when she said his name, 
her face apologetic. 

71 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Oh,” I mumbled, fixing my eyes on a pair of joggers 
as they passed us, drenched with sweat. 



“You two are more serious than I’d been thinking,” 
she went on. 

I frowned, quickly reviewing the last two days in my 
head. Edward and I had barely touched — in front of 
her, at least. I wondered if Renee was about to give 
me a lecture on responsibility, too. I didn’t mind that 
the way I had with Charlie. It wasn’t embarrassing 
with my mom. After all, I’d been the one giving her 
that lecture time and time again in the last ten years. 

“There’s something ... strange about the way you two 
are together,” she murmured, her forehead creasing 
over her troubled eyes. “The way he watches you — 
it’s so ... protective. Like he’s about to throw himself 
in front of a bullet to save you or something.” 

I laughed, though I was still not able to meet her gaze. 
“That’s a bad thing?” 

“No.” She frowned as she struggled for the words. “It’s 
just different. He’s very intense about you ... and very 
careful. I feel like I don’t really understand your 
relationship. Like there’s some secret I’m missing... .” 

“I think you’re imagining things, Mom,” I said quickly, 
struggling to keep my voice light. There was a flutter 
in my stomach. I’d forgotten how much my mother 
saw. Something about her simple view of the world 
cut through all the distractions and pierced right to 
the truth of things. This had never been a problem 
before. Until now, there had never been a secret I 
couldn’t tell her. 

“It’s not just him.” She set her lips defensively. “I wish 
you could see how you move around him.” 

72 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“What do you mean?” 



“The way you move — you orient yourself around him 
without even thinking about it. When he moves, even 
a little bit, you adjust your position at the same time. 
Like magnets ... or gravity. You’re like a ... satellite, or 
something. I’ve never seen anything like it.” 

She pursed her lips and stared down. 

“Don’t tell me,” I teased, forcing a smile. “You’re 
reading mysteries again, aren’t you? Or is it sci-fi this 
time?” 

Renee flushed a delicate pink. “That’s beside the 
point.” 

“Found anything good?” 

“Well, there was one — but that doesn’t matter. We’re 
talking about you right now.” 

“You should stick to romance, Mom. You know how 
you freak yourself out.” 

Her lips turned up at the corners. “I’m being silly, 
aren’t I?” 

For half a second I couldn’t answer. Renee was so 
easily swayed. Sometimes it was a good thing, 
because not all of her ideas were practical. But it 
pained me to see how quickly she caved in to my 
trivializing, especially since she was dead right this 
time. 

She looked up, and I controlled my expression. 

“Not silly — just being a mom.” 



73 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




She laughed and then gestured grandly toward the 
white sands stretching to the blue water. 

“And all this isn’t enough to get you to move back in 
with your silly mom?” 

I wiped my hand dramatically across my forehead, 
and then pretended to wring my hair out. 

“You get used to the humidity,” she promised. 

“You can get used to rain, too,” I countered. 

She elbowed me playfully and then took my hand as 
we walked back to her car. 

Other than her worries about me, she seemed happy 
enough. Content. She still looked at Phil with goo-goo 
eyes, and that was comforting. Surely her life was full 
and satisfying. Surely she didn’t miss me that much, 
even now... . 

Edward’s icy fingers brushed my cheek. I looked up, 
blinking, coming back to the present. He leaned down 
and kissed my forehead. 

“We’re home, Sleeping Beauty. Time to awake.” 

We were stopped in front of Charlie’s house. The 
porch light was on and the cruiser was parked in the 
driveway. As I examined the house, I saw the curtain 
twitch in the living room window, flashing a line of 
yellow light across the dark lawn. 

I sighed. Of course Charlie was waiting to pounce. 

Edward must have been thinking the same thing, 
because his expression was stiff and his eyes remote 
as he came to get my door for me. 

74 | Page 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“How bad?” I asked. 



“Charlie’s not going to be difficult,” Edward promised, 
his voice level with no hint of humor. “He missed 
you.” 

My eyes narrowed in doubt. If that was the case, then 
why was Edward tensed as if for a battle? 

My bag was small, but he insisted on carrying it into 
the house. Charlie held the door open for us. 

“Welcome home, kid!” Charlie shouted like he really 
meant it. “How was Jacksonville?” 

“Moist. And buggy.” 

“So Renee didn’t sell you on the University of 
Florida?” 

“She tried. But I’d rather drink water than inhale it.” 

Charlie’s eyes flickered unwillingly to Edward. “Did 
you have a nice time?” 

“Yes,” Edward answered in a serene voice. “Renee was 
very hospitable.” 

“That’s ... um, good. Glad you had fun.” Charlie 
turned away from Edward and pulled me in for an 
unexpected hug. 

“Impressive,” I whispered in his ear. 

He rumbled a laugh. “I really missed you, Bells. The 
food around here sucks when you’re gone.” 

“I’ll get on it,” I said as he let me go. 



75 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Would you call Jacob first? He’s been bugging me 
every five minutes since six o’clock this morning. I 
promised I’d have you call him before you even 
unpacked.” 

I didn’t have to look at Edward to feel that he was too 
still, too cold beside me. So this was the cause of his 
tension. 

“Jacob wants to talk to me?” 

“Pretty bad, I’d say. He wouldn’t tell me what it was 
about — just said it was important.” 

The phone rang then, shrill and demanding. 

“That’s him again, I’d bet my next paycheck,” Charlie 
muttered. 

“I got it.” I hurried to the kitchen. 

Edward followed after me while Charlie disappeared 
into the living room. 

I grabbed the phone mid-ring, and twisted around so 
that I was facing the wall. “Hello?” 

“You’re back,” Jacob said. 

His familiar husky voice sent a wave of wistfulness 
through me. A thousand memories spun in my head, 
tangling together — a rocky beach strewn with 
driftwood trees, a garage made of plastic sheds, warm 
sodas in a paper bag, a tiny room with one too-small 
shabby loveseat. The laughter in his deep-set black 
eyes, the feverish heat of his big hand around mine, 
the flash of his white teeth against his dark skin, his 
face stretching into the wide smile that had always 



76 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




been like a key to a secret door where only kindred 
spirits could enter. 

It felt sort of like homesickness, this longing for the 
place and person who had sheltered me through my 
darkest night. 

I cleared the lump from my throat. “Yes,” I answered. 

“Why didn’t you call me?” Jacob demanded. 

His angry tone instantly got my back up. “Because 
I’ve been in the house for exactly four seconds and 
your call interrupted Charlie telling me that you’d 
called.” 

“Oh. Sorry.” 

“Sure. Now, why are you harassing Charlie?” 

“I need to talk to you.” 

“Yeah, I figured out that part all by myself. Go ahead.” 

There was a short pause. 

“You going to school tomorrow?” 

I frowned to myself, unable to make sense of this 
question. “Of course I am. Why wouldn’t I?” 

“I dunno. Just curious.” 

Another pause. 

“So what did you want to talk about, Jake?” 

He hesitated. “Nothing really, I guess. I ... wanted to 
hear your voice.” 

77 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Yeah, I know. I’m so glad you called me, Jake. I ...” 
But I didn’t know what more to say. I wanted to tell 
him I was on my way to La Push right now. And I 
couldn’t tell him that. 

“I have to go,” he said abruptly. 

“What?” 

“I’ll talk to you soon, okay?” 

“But Jake — ” 

He was already gone. I listened to the dial tone with 
disbelief. 

“That was short,” I muttered. 

“Is everything all right?” Edward asked. His voice was 
low and careful. 

I turned slowly to face him. His expression was 
perfectly smooth — impossible to read. 

“I don’t know. I wonder what that was about.” It 
didn’t make sense that Jacob had been hounding 
Charlie all day just to ask me if I was going to school. 
And if he’d wanted to hear my voice, then why did he 
hang up so quickly? 

“Your guess is probably better than mine,” Edward 
said, the hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his 
mouth. 

“Mmm,” I murmured. That was true. I knew Jake 
inside and out. It shouldn’t be that complicated to 
figure out his motivations. 



78 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




With my thoughts miles away — about fifteen miles 
away, up the road to La Push — I started combing 
through the fridge, assembling ingredients for 
Charlie’s dinner. Edward leaned against the counter, 
and I was distantly aware that his eyes were on my 
face, but too preoccupied to worry about what he saw 
there. 

The school thing seemed like the key to me. That was 
the only real question Jake had asked. And he had to 
be after an answer to something, or he wouldn’t have 
been bugging Charlie so persistently. 

Why would my attendance record matter to him, 
though? 

I tried to think about it in a logical way. So, if I hadn’t 
been going to school tomorrow, what would be the 
problem with that, from Jacob’s perspective? Charlie 
had given me a little grief about missing a day of 
school so close to finals, but I’d convinced him that 
one Friday wasn’t going to derail my studies. Jake 
would hardly care about that. 

My brain refused to come up with any brilliant 
insights. Maybe I was missing some vital piece of 
information. 

What could have changed in the past three days that 
was so important that Jacob would break his long 
streak of refusing to answer my phone calls and 
contact me? What difference could three days make? 

I froze in the middle of the kitchen. The package of icy 
hamburger in my hands slipped through my numb 
fingers. It took me a slow second to miss the thud it 
should have made against the floor. 



79 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Edward had caught it and thrown it onto the counter. 
His arms were already around me, his lips at my ear. 

“What’s wrong?” 

I shook my head, dazed. 

Three days could change everything. 

Hadn’t I just been thinking about how impossible 
college was? How I couldn’t be anywhere near people 
after I’d gone through the painful three-day 
conversion that would set me free from mortality, so 
that I could spend eternity with Edward? The 
conversion that would make me forever a prisoner to 
my own thirst... . 

Had Charlie told Billy that I’d vanished for three 
days? Had Billy jumped to conclusions? Had Jacob 
really been asking me if I was still human? Making 
sure that the werewolves’ treaty was unbroken — that 
none of the Cullens had dared to bite a human . . . 
bite, not kill ... ? 

But did he honestly think I would come home to 
Charlie if that was the case? 

Edward shook me. “Bella?” he asked, truly anxious 
now. 

“I think ... I think he was checking,” I mumbled. 
“Checking to make sure. That I’m human, I mean.” 

Edward stiffened, and a low hiss sounded in my ear. 

“Well have to leave,” I whispered. “Before. So that it 
doesn’t break the treaty. We won’t ever be able to 
come back.” 



80 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




His arms tightened around me. “I know.” 

“Ahem.” Charlie cleared his voice loudly behind us. 

I jumped, and then pulled free of Edward’s arms, my 
face getting hot. Edward leaned back against the 
counter. His eyes were tight. I could see worry in 
them, and anger. 

“If you don’t want to make dinner, I can call for a 
pizza,” Charlie hinted. 

“No, that’s okay, I’m already started.” 

“Okay,” Charlie said. He propped himself against the 
doorframe, folding his arms. 

I sighed and got to work, trying to ignore my 
audience. 

“If I asked you to do something, would you trust me?” 
Edward asked, an edge to his soft voice. 

We were almost to school. Edward had been relaxed 
and joking just a moment ago, and now suddenly his 
hands were clenched tight on the steering wheel, his 
knuckles straining in an effort not to snap it into 
pieces. 

I stared at his anxious expression — his eyes were far 
away, like he was listening to distant voices. 

My pulse sped in response to his stress, but I 
answered carefully. “That depends.” 

We pulled into the school lot. 

“I was afraid you would say that.” 



81 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“What do you want me to do, Edward?” 

“I want you to stay in the car.” He pulled into his 
usual spot and turned the engine off as he spoke. “I 
want you to wait here until I come back for you.” 

“But ... why?” 

That was when I saw him. He would have been hard 
to miss, towering over the students the way he did, 
even if he hadn’t been leaning against his black 
motorcycle, parked illegally on the sidewalk. 

“Oh.” 

Jacob’s face was a calm mask that I recognized well. 

It was the face he used when he was determined to 
keep his emotions in check, to keep himself under 
control. It made him look like Sam, the oldest of the 
wolves, the leader of the Quileute pack. But Jacob 
could never quite manage the perfect serenity Sam 
always exuded. 

I’d forgotten how much this face bothered me. Though 
I’d gotten to know Sam pretty well before the Cullens 
had come back — to like him, even — I’d never been 
able to completely shake the resentment I felt when 
Jacob mimicked Sam’s expression. It was a stranger’s 
face. He wasn’t my Jacob when he wore it. 

“You jumped to the wrong conclusion last night,” 
Edward murmured. “He asked about school because 
he knew that I would be where you were. He was 
looking for a safe place to talk to me. A place with 
witnesses.” 

So I’d misinterpreted Jacob’s motives last night. 
Missing information, that was the problem. 



82 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Information like why in the world Jacob would want 
to talk to Edward. 

“I’m not staying in the car,” I said. 

Edward groaned quietly. “Of course not. Well, let’s get 
this over with.” 

Jacob’s face hardened as we walked toward him, 
hand in hand. 

I noticed other faces, too — the faces of my 
classmates. I noticed how their eyes widened as they 
took in all six foot seven inches of Jacob’s long body, 
muscled up the way no normal sixteen-and-a-half- 
year-old ever had been. I saw those eyes rake over his 
tight black t-shirt — short-sleeved, though the day 
was unseasonably cool — his ragged, grease-smeared 
jeans, and the glossy black bike he leaned against. 
Their eyes didn’t linger on his face — something 
about his expression had them glancing quickly away. 
And I noticed the wide berth everyone gave him, the 
bubble of space that no one dared to encroach on. 

With a sense of astonishment, I realized that Jacob 
looked dangerous to them. How odd. 

Edward stopped a few yards away from Jacob, and I 
could tell that he was uncomfortable having me so 
close to a werewolf. He drew his hand back slightly, 
pulling me halfway behind his body. 

“You could have called us,” Edward said in a steel- 
hard voice. 

“Sorry,” Jacob answered, his face twisting into a 
sneer. “I don’t have any leeches on my speed dial.”

“You could have reached me at Bella’s house, of 
course.” 

Jacob’s jaw flexed, and his brows pulled together. He 
didn’t answer. 

“This is hardly the place, Jacob. Could we discuss 
this later?” 

“Sure, sure. I’ll stop by your crypt after school.” Jacob 
snorted. “What’s wrong with now?” 

Edward looked around pointedly, his eyes resting on 
the witnesses who were just barely out of hearing 
range. A few people were hesitating on the sidewalk, 
their eyes bright with expectation. Like they were 
hoping a fight might break out to alleviate the tedium 
of another Monday morning. I saw Tyler Crowley 
nudge Austin Marks, and they both paused on their 
way to class. 

“I already know what you came to say,” Edward 
reminded Jacob in voice so low that I could barely 
make it out. “Message delivered. Consider us 
warned.” 

Edward glanced down at me for a fleeting second with 
worried eyes. 

“Warned?” I asked blankly. “What are you talking 
about?” 

“You didn’t tell her?” Jacob asked, his eyes widening 
with disbelief. “What, were you afraid she’d take our 
side?” 

“Please drop it, Jacob,” Edward said in an even voice. 

“Why?” Jacob challenged. 

84 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I frowned in confusion. “What don’t I know? Edward?” 



Edward just glared at Jacob as if he hadn’t heard me. 
“Jake?” 

Jacob raised his eyebrow at me. “He didn’t tell you 
that his big . . . brother crossed the line Saturday 
night?” he asked, his tone thickly layered with 
sarcasm. Then his eyes flickered back to Edward. 
“Paul was totally justified in — ” 

“It was no-man’s land!” Edward hissed. 

“Was not!” 

Jacob was fuming visibly. His hands trembled. He 
shook his head and sucked in two deep lungfuls of 
air. 

“Emmett and Paul?” I whispered. Paul was Jacob’s 
most volatile pack brother. He was the one who’d lost 
control that day in the woods — the memory of the 
snarling gray wolf was suddenly vivid in my head. 
“What happened? Were they fighting?” My voice 
strained higher in panic. “Why? Did Paul get hurt?” 

“No one fought,” Edward said quietly, only to me. “No 
one got hurt. Don’t be anxious.” 

Jacob was staring at us with incredulous eyes. “You 
didn’t tell her anything at all, did you? Is that why 
you took her away? So she wouldn’t know that — ?” 

“Leave now.” Edward cut him off mid-sentence, and 
his face was abruptly frightening — truly frightening. 
For a second, he looked like ... like a vampire. He 
glared at Jacob with vicious, unveiled loathing. 



85 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jacob raised his eyebrows, but made no other move. 
“Why haven’t you told her?” 

They faced each other in silence for a long moment. 
More students gathered behind Tyler and Austin. I 
saw Mike next to Ben — Mike had one hand on Ben’s 
shoulder, like he was holding him in place. 

In the dead silence, all the details suddenly fell into 
place for me with a burst of intuition. 

Something Edward didn’t want me to know. 

Something that Jacob wouldn’t have kept from me. 

Something that had the Cullens and the wolves both 
in the woods, moving in hazardous proximity to each 
other. 

Something that would cause Edward to insist that I 
fly across the country. 

Something that Alice had seen in a vision last week — 
a vision Edward had lied to me about. 

Something I’d been waiting for anyway. Something I 
knew would happen again, as much as I might wish it 
never would. It was never going to end, was it? 

I heard the quick gasp, gasp, gasp, gasp of the air 
dragging through my lips, but I couldn’t stop it. It 
looked like the school was shaking, like there was an 
earthquake, but I knew it was my own trembling that 
caused the illusion. 

“She came back for me,” I choked out. 

Victoria was never going to give up till I was dead. She 
would keep repeating the same pattern — feint and 

86 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




run, feint and run — until she found a hole through 
my defenders. 

Maybe I’d get lucky. Maybe the Volturi would come for 
me first — they’d kill me quicker, at least. 

Edward held me tight to his side, angling his body so 
that he was still between me and Jacob, and stroked 
my face with anxious hands. “It’s fine,” he whispered 
to me. “It’s fine. I’ll never let her get close to you, it’s 
fine.” 

Then he glared at Jacob. “Does that answer your 
question, mongrel?” 

“You don’t think Bella has a right to know?” Jacob 
challenged. “It’s her life.” 

Edward kept his voice muted; even Tyler, edging 
forward by inches, would be unable to hear. “Why 
should she be frightened when she was never in 
danger?” 

“Better frightened than lied to.” 

I tried to pull myself together, but my eyes were 
swimming in moisture. I could see it behind my lids 
— I could see Victoria’s face, her lips pulled back over 
her teeth, her crimson eyes glowing with the 
obsession of her vendetta; she held Edward 
responsible for the demise of her love, James. She 
wouldn’t stop until his love was taken from him, too. 

Edward wiped the tears from my cheek with his 
fingertips. 

“Do you really think hurting her is better than 
protecting her?” he murmured. 



87 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“She’s tougher than you think,” Jacob said. “And 
she’s been through worse.” 

Abruptly, Jacob’s expression shifted, and he was 
staring at Edward with an odd, speculative 
expression. His eyes narrowed like he was trying to do 
a difficult math problem in his head. 

I felt Edward cringe. I glanced up at him, and his face 
was contorted in what could only be pain. For one 
ghastly moment, I was reminded of our afternoon in 
Italy, in the macabre tower room of the Volturi, where 
Jane had tortured Edward with her malignant gift, 
burning him with her thoughts alone... . 

The memory snapped me out of my near hysteria and 
put everything in perspective. Because I’d rather 
Victoria killed me a hundred times over than watch 
Edward suffer that way again. 

“That’s funny,” Jacob said, laughing as he watched 
Edward’s face. 

Edward winced, but smoothed his expression with a 
little effort. He couldn’t quite hide the agony in his 
eyes. 

I glanced, wide-eyed, from Edward’s grimace to 
Jacob’s sneer. 

“What are you doing to him?” I demanded. 

“It’s nothing, Bella,” Edward told me quietly. “Jacob 
just has a good memory, that’s all.” 

Jacob grinned, and Edward winced again. 

“Stop it! Whatever you’re doing.” 



88 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Sure, if you want.” Jacob shrugged. “It’s his own 
fault if he doesn’t like the things I remember, 
though.” 

I glared at him, and he smiled back impishly — like a 
kid caught doing something he knows he shouldn’t by 
someone who he knows won’t punish him. 

“The principal’s on his way to discourage loitering on 
school property,” Edward murmured to me. “Let’s get 
to English, Bella, so you’re not involved.” 

“Overprotective, isn’t he?” Jacob said, talking just to 
me. “A little trouble makes life fun. Let me guess, 
you’re not allowed to have fun, are you?” 

Edward glowered, and his lips pulled back from his 
teeth ever so slightly. 

“Shut up, Jake,” I said. 

Jacob laughed. “That sounds like a no. Hey, if you 
ever feel like having a life again, you could come see 
me. I’ve still got your motorcycle in my garage.” 

This news distracted me. “You were supposed to sell 
that. You promised Charlie you would.” If I hadn’t 
begged on Jake’s behalf — after all, he’d put weeks of 
labor into both motorcycles, and he deserved some 
kind of payback — Charlie would have thrown my 
bike in a Dumpster. And possibly set that Dumpster 
on fire. 

“Yeah, right. Like I would do that. It belongs to you, 
not me. Anyway, I’ll hold on to it until you want it 
back.” 

A tiny hint of the smile I remembered was suddenly 
playing around the edges of his lips. 

89 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Jake ...” 



He leaned forward, his face earnest now, the bitter 
sarcasm fading. “I think I might have been wrong 
before, you know, about not being able to be friends. 
Maybe we could manage it, on my side of the line. 
Come see me.” 

I was vividly conscious of Edward, his arms still 
wrapped protectively around me, motionless as a 
stone. I shot a look at his face — it was calm, patient. 

“I, er, don’t know about that, Jake.” 

Jacob dropped the antagonistic fapade completely. It 
was like he’d forgotten Edward was there, or at least 
he was determined to act that way. “I miss you every 
day, Bella. It’s not the same without you.” 

“I know and I’m sorry, Jake, I just ...” 

He shook his head, and sighed. “I know. Doesn’t 
matter, right? I guess I’ll survive or something. Who 
needs friends?” He grimaced, trying to cover the pain 
with a thin attempt at bravado. 

Jacob’s suffering had always triggered my protective 
side. It was not entirely rational — Jacob was hardly 
in need of any physical protection I could offer. But 
my arms, pinned beneath Edward’s, yearned to reach 
out to him. To wrap around his big, warm waist in a 
silent promise of acceptance and comfort. 

Edward’s shielding arms had become restraints. 

“Okay, get to class,” a stern voice sounded behind us. 
“Move along, Mr. Crowley.” 



90 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Get to school, Jake,” I whispered, anxious as soon as 
I recognized the principal’s voice. Jacob went to the 
Quileute school, but he might still get in trouble for 
trespassing or the equivalent. 

Edward released me, taking just my hand and pulling 
me behind his body again. 

Mr. Greene pushed through the circle of spectators, 
his brows pressing down like ominous storm clouds 
over his small eyes. 

“I mean it,” he was threatening. “Detention for anyone 
who’s still standing here when I turn around again.” 

The audience melted away before he was finished 
with his sentence. 

“Ah, Mr. Cullen. Do we have a problem here?” 

“Not at all, Mr. Greene. We were just on our way to 
class.” 

“Excellent. I don’t seem to recognize your friend.” Mr. 
Greene turned his glower on Jacob. “Are you a new 
student here?” 

Mr. Greene’s eyes scrutinized Jacob, and I could see 
that he’d come to the same conclusion everyone else 
had: dangerous. A troublemaker. 

“Nope,” Jacob answered, half a smirk on his broad 
lips. 

“Then I suggest you remove yourself from school 
property at once, young man, before I call the police.” 

Jacob’s little smirk became a full-blown grin, and I 
knew he was picturing Charlie showing up to arrest 

91 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




him. This grin was too bitter, too full of mocking to 
satisfy me. This wasn’t the smile I’d been waiting to 
see. 

Jacob said, “Yes, sir,” and snapped a military salute 
before he climbed on his bike and kicked it to a start 
right there on the sidewalk. The engine snarled and 
then the tires squealed as he spun it sharply around. 
In a matter of seconds, Jacob raced out of sight. 

Mr. Greene gnashed his teeth together while he 
watched the performance. 

“Mr. Cullen, I expect you to ask your friend to refrain 
from trespassing again.” 

“He’s no friend of mine, Mr. Greene, but I’ll pass along 
the warning.” 

Mr. Greene pursed his lips. Edward’s perfect grades 
and spotless record were clearly a factor in Mr. 
Greene’s assessment of the incident. “I see. If you’re 
worried about any trouble, I’d be happy to — ” 

“There’s nothing to worry about, Mr. Greene. There 
won’t be any trouble.” 

“I hope that’s correct. Well, then. On to class. You, 
too, Miss Swan.” 

Edward nodded, and pulled me quickly along toward 
the English building. 

“Do you feel well enough to go to class?” he whispered 
when we were past the principal. 

“Yes,” I whispered back, not quite sure if this was a 
lie. 



92 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Whether I felt well or not was hardly the most 
important consideration. I needed to talk to Edward 
right away, and English class wasn’t the ideal place 
for the conversation I had in mind. 



But with Mr. Greene right behind us, there weren’t a 
lot of other options. 

We got to class a little late and took our seats quickly. 
Mr. Berty was reciting a Frost poem. He ignored our 
entrance, refusing to let us break his rhythm. 



I yanked a blank page out of my notebook and started 
writing, my handwriting more illegible than normal 
thanks to my agitation.

I shoved the note at Edward. He sighed, and then 
began writing. It took him less time than me, though 
he wrote an entire paragraph in his own personal 
calligraphy before he slipped the paper back.

I frowned at the letters on the page. All of them had 
been in on it — Emmett, Jasper, Alice, Rosalie, and 
Carlisle. Maybe even Esme, though he hadn’t 
mentioned her. And then Paul and the rest of the 
Quileute pack. It might so easily have turned into a 
fight, pitting my future family and my old friends 
against each other. Any one of them could have been 
hurt. I imagined the wolves would be in the most 
danger, but picturing tiny Alice next to one of the 
huge werewolves, fighting ... 

I shuddered. 

Carefully, I scrubbed out the entire paragraph with 
my eraser and then I wrote over the top:

Edward was shaking his head before I finished, 
obviously going to downplay any danger on Charlie’s 
behalf. He held a hand out, but I ignored that and 
started again.

That wasn’t what I’d meant at all; I hadn’t thought of 
going without him. I’d meant that we should have 
stayed here together. But I was sidetracked by his 
response, and a little miffed. Like I couldn’t fly cross 
country without bringing the plane down. Very funny.

I stared at him wordlessly. 

“What?” he whispered.

I scrubbed out the disconcerting conversation and 
wrote one more line.

I knew there would be a next time. The pattern would 
continue until someone lost. 

Edward stared into my eyes for a long moment. I 
wondered what my face looked like — it felt cold, so 
the blood hadn’t returned to my cheeks. My eyelashes 
were still wet. 

He sighed and then nodded once.

The paper disappeared from under my hand. I looked 
up, blinking in surprise, just as Mr. Berty came down 
the aisle. 

“Is that something you’d like to share there, Mr. 
Cullen?” 

Edward looked up innocently and held out the sheet 
of paper on top of his folder. “My notes?” he asked, 
sounding confused. 

Mr. Berty scanned the notes — no doubt a perfect 
transcription of his lecture — and then walked away 
frowning. 

It was later, in Calculus — my one class without 
Edward — that I heard the gossip. 

“My money’s on the big Indian,” someone was saying. 

I peeked up to see that Tyler, Mike, Austin, and Ben 
had their heads bent together, deep in conversation. 

“Yeah,” Mike whispered. “Did you see the size of that 
Jacob kid? I think he could take Cullen down.” Mike 
sounded pleased by the idea. 

“I don’t think so,” Ben disagreed. “There’s something 
about Edward. He’s always so ... confident. I have a 
feeling he can take care of himself.” 

“I’m with Ben,” Tyler agreed. “Besides, if that other 
kid messed Edward up, you know those big brothers 
of his would get involved.” 

“Have you been down to La Push lately?” Mike asked. 
“Lauren and I went to the beach a couple of weeks 
ago, and believe me, Jacob’s friends are all just as big 
as he is.” 

97 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Huh,” Tyler said. “Too bad it didn’t turn into 
anything. Guess we’ll never know how it would have 
turned out.” 

“It didn’t look over to me,” Austin said. “Maybe we’ll 
get to see.” 

Mike grinned. “Anyone in the mood for a bet?” 

“Ten on Jacob,” Austin said at once. 

“Ten on Cullen,” Tyler chimed in. 

“Ten on Edward,” Ben agreed. 

“Jacob,” Mike said. 

“Hey, do you guys know what it was about?” Austin 
wondered. “That might affect the odds.” 

“I can guess,” Mike said, and then he shot a glance at 
me at the same time that Ben and Tyler did. 

From their expressions, none of them had realized I 
was in easy hearing distance. They all looked away 
quickly, shuffling the papers on their desks. 

“I still say Jacob,” Mike muttered under his breath.

I was having a bad week. 

I knew that essentially nothing had changed. Okay, 
so Victoria had not given up, but had I ever dreamed 
for one moment that she had? Her reappearance had 
only confirmed what I’d already known. No reason for 
fresh panic. 

In theory. Not panicking was easier said than done. 

Graduation was only a few weeks away, but I 
wondered if it wasn’t a little foolish to sit around, 
weak and tasty, waiting for the next disaster. It 
seemed too dangerous to be human — just begging 
for trouble. Someone like me shouldn’t be human. 
Someone with my luck ought to be a little less 
helpless. 

But no one would listen to me. 

Carlisle had said, “There are seven of us, Bella. And 
with Alice on our side, I don’t think Victoria’s going to 
catch us off guard. I think it’s important, for Charlie’s 
sake, that we stick with the original plan.” 

Esme had said, “We’d never allow anything to happen 
to you, sweetheart. You know that. Please don’t be 
anxious.” And then she’d kissed my forehead. 

Emmett had said, “I’m really glad Edward didn’t kill 
you. Everything’s so much more fun with you 
around.” 



Rosalie had glared at him. 

99 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



Alice had rolled her eyes and said, “I’m offended. 
You’re not honestly worried about this, are you?” 

“If it’s no big deal, then why did Edward drag me to 
Florida?” I’d demanded. 

“Haven’t you noticed yet, Bella, that Edward is just 
the teeniest bit prone to overreaction?” 

Jasper had silently erased all the panic and tension 
in my body with his curious talent of controlling 
emotional atmospheres. I’d felt reassured, and let 
them talk me out of my desperate pleading. 

Of course, that calm had worn off as soon as Edward 
and I had walked out of the room. 

So the consensus was that I was just supposed to 
forget that a deranged vampire was stalking me, 
intent on my death. Go about my business. 

I did try. And surprisingly, there were other things 
almost as stressful to dwell on besides my status on 
the endangered species list... . 

Because Edward’s response had been the most 
frustrating of them all. 

“That’s between you and Carlisle,” he’d said. “Of 
course, you know that I’m willing to make it between 
you and me at any time that you wish. You know my 
condition.” And he had smiled angelically. 

Ugh. I did know his condition. Edward had promised 
that he would change me himself whenever I wanted 
... just as long as I was married to him first. 

Sometimes I wondered if he was only pretending that 
he couldn’t read my mind. How else had he struck 

100 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




upon the one condition that I would have trouble 
accepting? The one condition that would slow me 
down. 

All in all, a very bad week. And today was the worst 
day in it. 

It was always a bad day when Edward was away. 

Alice had foreseen nothing out of the ordinary this 
weekend, and so I’d insisted that he take the 
opportunity to go hunting with his brothers. I knew 
how it bored him to hunt the easy, nearby prey. 

“Go have fun,” I’d told him. “Bag a few mountain lions 
for me.” 



I would never admit to him how hard it was for me 
when he was gone — how it brought back the 
abandonment nightmares. If he knew that, it would 
make him feel horrible and he would be afraid to ever 
leave me, even for the most necessary reasons. It had 
been like that in the beginning, when he’d first 
returned from Italy. His golden eyes had turned black 
and he’d suffered from his thirst more than it was 
already necessary that he suffer. So I put on a brave 
face and all but kicked him out the door whenever 
Emmett and Jasper wanted to go. 

I think he saw through me, though. A little. This 
morning there had been a note left on my pillow: 



J He back so soon you won t have time to miss me. £ook 
^ajtcr my heart vejlcfe it with you. 



So now I had a big empty Saturday with nothing but 
my morning shift at Newton’s Olympic Outfitters to 



101 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




distract me. And, of course, the oh-so-comforting 
promise from Alice. 

“I’m staying close to home to hunt. I’ll only be fifteen 
minutes away if you need me. I’ll keep an eye out for 
trouble.” 

Translation: don’t try anything funny just because 
Edward is gone. 

Alice was certainly just as capable of crippling my 
truck as Edward was. 

I tried to look on the bright side. After work, I had 
plans to help Angela with her announcements, so that 
would be a distraction. And Charlie was in an 
excellent mood due to Edward’s absence, so I might 
as well enjoy that while it lasted. Alice would spend 
the night with me if I was pathetic enough to ask her 
to. And then tomorrow, Edward would be home. I 
would survive. 

Not wanting to be ridiculously early for work, I ate my 
breakfast slowly, one Cheerio at a time. Then, when 
I’d washed the dishes, I arranged the magnets on the 
fridge into a perfect line. Maybe I was developing 
obsessive-compulsive disorder. 

The last two magnets — round black utilitarian pieces 
that were my favorites because they could hold ten 
sheets of paper to the fridge without breaking a sweat 
— did not want to cooperate with my fixation. Their 
polarities were reversed; every time I tried to line the 
last one up, the other jumped out of place. 

For some reason — impending mania, perhaps — this 
really irritated me. Why couldn’t they just play nice? 
Stupid with stubbornness, I kept shoving them 
together as if I was expecting them to suddenly give 

102 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




up. I could have flipped one over, but that felt like 
losing. Finally, exasperated at myself more than the 
magnets, I pulled them from the fridge and held them 
together with two hands. It took a little effort — they 
were strong enough to put up a fight — but I forced 
them to coexist side-by-side. 

“See,” I said out loud — talking to inanimate objects, 
never a good sign — “That’s not so horrible, is it?” 

I stood there like an idiot for a second, not quite able 
to admit that I wasn’t having any lasting effect 
against scientific principles. Then, with a sigh, I put 
the magnets back on the fridge, a foot apart. 

“There’s no need to be so inflexible,” I muttered. 

It was still too early, but I decided I’d better get out of 
the house before the inanimate objects started talking 
back. 

When I got to Newton’s, Mike was methodically dry 
mopping the aisles while his mom arranged a new 
counter display. I caught them in the middle of an 
argument, unaware that I had arrived. 

“But it’s the only time that Tyler can go,” Mike 
complained. “You said after graduation — ” 

“You’re just going to have to wait,” Mrs. Newton 
snapped. “You and Tyler can think of something else 
to do. You are not going to Seattle until the police 
stop whatever it is that is going on there. I know Beth 
Crowley has told Tyler the same thing, so don’t act 
like I’m the bad guy — oh, good morning, Bella,” she 
said when she caught sight of me, brightening her 
tone quickly. “You’re early.”

Karen Newton was the last person I’d think to ask for 
help in an outdoor sports equipment store. Her 
perfectly highlighted blond hair was always smoothed 
into an elegant twist on the back of her neck, her 
fingernails were polished by professionals, as were 
her toenails — visible through the strappy high heels 
that didn’t resemble anything Newton’s offered on the 
long row of hiking boots. 

“Light traffic,” I joked as I grabbed my hideous 
fluorescent orange vest out from under the counter. I 
was surprised that Mrs. Newton was as worked up 
about this Seattle thing as Charlie. I’d thought he was 
going to extremes. 

“Well, er ...” Mrs. Newton hesitated for a moment, 
playing uncomfortably with a stack of flyers she was 
arranging by the register. 

I stopped with one arm in my vest. I knew that look. 

When I’d let the Newtons know that I wouldn’t be 
working here this summer — abandoning them in 
their busiest season, in effect — they’d started 
training Katie Marshall to take my place. They 
couldn’t really afford both of us on the payroll at the 
same time, so when it looked like a slow day ... 

“I was going to call,” Mrs. Newton continued. “I don’t 
think we’re expecting a ton of business today. Mike 
and I can probably handle things. I’m sorry you got 
up and drove out... .” 

On a normal day, I would be ecstatic with this turn of 
events. Today ... not so much. 

“Okay,” I sighed. My shoulders slumped. What was I 
going to do now?

“That’s not fair, Mom,” Mike said. “If Bella wants to 
work — ” 

“No, it’s okay, Mrs. Newton. Really, Mike. I’ve got 
finals to study for and stuff... .” I didn’t want to be a 
source of familial discord when they were already 
arguing. 

“Thanks, Bella. Mike, you missed aisle four. Um, 
Bella, do you mind throwing these flyers in a 
Dumpster on the way out? I told the girl who left 
them here that I’d put them on the counter, but I 
really don’t have the room.” 

“Sure, no problem.” I put my vest away, and then 
tucked the flyers under my arm and headed out into 
the misty rain. 

The Dumpster was around the side of Newton’s, next 
to where we employees were supposed to park. I 
shuffled along, kicking pebbles petulantly on my way. 
I was about to fling the stack of bright yellow papers 
into the trash when the heading printed in bold 
across the top caught my eye. One word in particular 
seized my attention. 

I clutched the papers in both hands as I stared at the 
picture beneath the caption. A lump rose in my 
throat. 

SAVE THE OLYMPIC WOLF 

Under the words, there was a detailed drawing of a 
wolf in front of a fir tree, its head thrown back in the 
act of baying at the moon. It was a disconcerting 
picture; something about the wolf’s plaintive posture 
made him look forlorn. Like he was howling in grief. 



105 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




And then I was running to my truck, the flyers still 
locked in my grip. 

Fifteen minutes — that’s all I had. But it should be 
long enough. It was only fifteen minutes to La Push, 
and surely I would cross the boundary line a few 
minutes before I hit the town. 

My truck roared to life without any difficulty. 

Alice couldn’t have seen me doing this, because I 
hadn’t been planning it. A snap decision, that was the 
key! And as long as I moved fast enough, I should be 
able to capitalize on it. 

I’d thrown the damp flyers in my haste and they were 
scattered in a bright mess across the passenger seat 
— a hundred bolded captions, a hundred dark 
howling wolves outlined against the yellow 
background. 

I barreled down the wet highway, turning the 
windshield wipers on high and ignoring the groan of 
the ancient engine. Fifty-five was the most I could 
coax out of my truck, and I prayed it would be 
enough. 

I had no clue where the boundary line was, but I 
began to feel safer as I passed the first houses outside 
La Push. This must be beyond where Alice was 
allowed to follow. 

I’d call her when I got to Angela’s this afternoon, I 
reasoned, so that she’d know I was fine. There was no 
reason for her to get worked up. She didn’t need to be 
mad at me — Edward would be angry enough for two 
when he got back.

Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




My truck was positively wheezing by the time it grated 
to a stop in front of the familiar faded red house. The 
lump came back to my throat as I stared at the little 
place that had once been my refuge. It had been so 
long since I’d been here. 

Before I could cut the engine, Jacob was standing in 
the door, his face blank with shock. 

In the sudden silence when the truck-roar died, I 
heard him gasp. 

“Bella?” 

“Hey, Jake!” 

“Bella!” he yelled back, and the smile I’d been waiting 
for stretched across his face like the sun breaking free 
of the clouds. His teeth gleamed bright against his 
russet skin. “I can’t believe it!” 

He ran to the truck and half-yanked me through the 
open door, and then we were both jumping up and 
down like kids. 

“How did you get here?” 

“I snuck out!” 

“Awesome!” 

“Hey, Bella!” Billy had rolled himself into the doorway 
to see what all the commotion was about. 

“Hey, Bil — !” 

Just then my air choked off — Jacob grabbed me up 
in a bear hug too tight to breathe and swung me 
around in a circle. 

107 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Wow, it’s good to see you here!” 

“Can’t ... breathe,” I gasped. 

He laughed and put me down. 

“Welcome back, Bella,” he said, grinning. And the way 
he said the words made it sound like welcome home. 

We started walking, too keyed up to sit still in the 
house. Jacob was practically bouncing as he moved, 
and I had to remind him a few times that my legs 
weren’t ten feet long. 

As we walked, I felt myself settling into another 
version of myself, the self I had been with Jacob. A 
little younger, a little less responsible. Someone who 
might, on occasion, do something really stupid for no 
good reason. 

Our exuberance lasted through the first few topics of 
conversation: how we were doing, what we were up to, 
how long I had, and what had brought me here. When 
I hesitantly told him about the wolf flyer, his 
bellowing laugh echoed back from the trees. 

But then, as we ambled past the back of the store and 
shoved through the thick scrub that ringed the far 
edge of First Beach, we got to the hard parts. All too 
soon we had to talk about the reasons behind our 
long separation, and I watched as the face of my 
friend hardened into the bitter mask that was already 
too familiar. 

“So what’s the story, anyway?” Jacob asked me, 
kicking a piece of driftwood out of his way with too 
much force. It sailed over the sand and then clattered 
against the rocks. “I mean, since the last time we ... 
well, before, you know ...” He struggled for the words. 
108 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




He took a deep breath and tried again. “What I’m 
asking is ... everything is just back to the way it was 
before he left? You forgave him for all of that?” 

I took a deep breath. “There was nothing to forgive.” 

I wanted to skip past this part, the betrayals, the 
accusations, but I knew that we had to talk it through 
before we’d be able to move on to anything else. 

Jacob’s face puckered up like he’d just licked a 
lemon. “I wish Sam had taken a picture when he 
found you that night last September. It would be 
exhibit A.” 

“Nobody’s on trial.” 

“Maybe somebody should be.” 

“Not even you would blame him for leaving, if you 
knew the reason why.” 

He glared at me for a few seconds. “Okay,” he 
challenged acidly. “Amaze me.” 

His hostility was wearing on me — chafing against the 
raw; it hurt to have him angry with me. It reminded 
me of the bleak afternoon, long ago, when — under 
orders from Sam — he’d told me we couldn’t be 
friends. I took a second to compose myself. 

“Edward left me last fall because he didn’t think I 
should be hanging out with vampires. He thought it 
would be healthier for me if he left.” 

Jacob did a double take. He had to scramble for a 
minute. Whatever he’d been planning to say, it clearly 
no longer applied. I was glad he didn’t know the 
catalyst behind Edward’s decision. I could only 

109 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




imagine what he’d think if he knew Jasper had tried 
to kill me. 



“He came back, though, didn’t he?” Jacob muttered. 
“Too bad he can’t stick to a decision.” 

“If you remember, I went and got him.” 

Jacob stared at me for a moment, and then he backed 
off. His face relaxed, and his voice was calmer when 
he spoke. 

“That’s true. So I never did get the story. What 
happened?” 

I hesitated, biting my lip. 

“Is it a secret?” His voice took on a taunting edge. 

“Are you not allowed to tell me?” 

“No,” I snapped. “It’s just a really long story.” 

Jacob smiled, arrogant, and turned to walk up the 
beach, expecting me to follow. 

It was no fun being with Jacob if he was going to act 
like this. I trailed behind him automatically, not sure 
if I shouldn’t turn around and leave. I was going to 
have to face Alice, though, when I got home... . I 
supposed I wasn’t in any rush. 

Jacob walked to a huge, familiar piece of driftwood — 
an entire tree, roots and all, bleached white and 
beached deep in the sand; it was our tree, in a way. 

Jacob sat down on the natural bench, and patted the 
space next to him. 

“I don’t mind long stories. Is there any action?” 

110 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




I rolled my eyes as I sat next to him. “There’s some 
action,” I allowed. 

“It wouldn’t be real horror without action.” 

“Horror!” I scoffed. “Can you listen, or will you be 
interrupting me with rude comments about my 
friends?” 

He pretended to lock his lips and then threw the 
invisible key over his shoulder. I tried not to smile, 
and failed. 

“I’ll have to start with the stuff you were already there 
for,” I decided, working to organize the stories in my 
head before I began. 

Jacob raised his hand. 

“Go ahead.” 

“That’s good,” he said. “I didn’t understand much that 
was going on at the time.” 

“Yeah, well, it gets complicated, so pay attention. You 
know how Alice sees things?” 

I took his scowl — the wolves weren’t thrilled that the 
legends of vampires possessing supernatural gifts 
were true — for a yes, and proceeded with the 
account of my race through Italy to rescue Edward. 

I kept it as succinct as possible — leaving out 
anything that wasn’t essential. I tried to read Jacob’s 
reactions, but his face was enigmatic as I explained 
how Alice had seen Edward plan to kill himself when 
he’d heard that I was dead. Sometimes Jacob seemed 
so deep in thought, I wasn’t sure if he was listening. 
He only interrupted one time.

“The fortune-telling bloodsucker can’t see us?” he 
echoed, his face both fierce and gleeful. “Seriously? 
That’s excellent!” 

I clenched my teeth together, and we sat in silence, 
his face expectant as he waited for me to continue. I 
glared at him until he realized his mistake. 

“Oops!” he said. “Sorry.” He locked his lips again. 

His response was easier to read when I got to the part 
about the Volturi. His teeth clenched together, goose 
bumps rose on his arms, and his nostrils flared. I 
didn’t go into specifics, I just told him that Edward 
had talked us out of trouble, without revealing the 
promise we’d had to make, or the visit we were 
anticipating. Jacob didn’t need to have my 
nightmares. 

“Now you know the whole story,” I concluded. “So it’s 
your turn to talk. What happened while I was with my 
mom this weekend?” I knew Jacob would give me 
more details than Edward had. He wasn’t afraid of 
scaring me. 

Jacob leaned forward, instantly animated. “So Embry 
and Quil and I were running patrol on Saturday 
night, just routine stuff, when out of nowhere — 
bam!” He threw his arms out, impersonating an 
explosion. “There it is — a fresh trail, not fifteen 
minutes old. Sam wanted us to wait for him, but I 
didn’t know you were gone, and I didn’t know if your 
bloodsuckers were keeping an eye on you or not. So 
we took off after her at full speed, but she’d crossed 
the treaty line before we caught up. We spread out 
along the line, hoping she’d cross back over. It was 
frustrating, let me tell you.” He wagged his head and 
his hair — growing out from the short crop he’d 
adopted when he’d joined the pack — flopped into his 
112 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




eyes. “We ended up too far south. The Cullens chased 
her back to our side just a few miles north of us. 
Would have been the perfect ambush if we’d known 
where to wait.” 

He shook his head, grimacing now. “That’s when it 
got dicey. Sam and the others caught up to her before 
we did, but she was dancing right along the line, and 
the whole coven was right there on the other side. The 
big one, what’s-his-name — ” 

“Emmett.” 

“Yeah, him. He made a lunge for her, but that 
redhead is fast! He flew right behind her and almost 
rammed into Paul. So, Paul ... well, you know Paul.” 

“Yeah.” 

“Lost his focus. Can’t say that I blame him — the big 
bloodsucker was right on top of him. He sprang — 
hey, don’t give me that look. The vampire was on our 
land.” 

I tried to compose my face so that he would go on. My 
nails were digging into my palms with the stress of 
the story, even though I knew it had turned out fine. 

“Anyway, Paul missed, and the big one got back on 
his side. But by then the, er, well the, uh, blonde ...” 
Jacob’s expression was a comical mix of disgust and 
unwilling admiration as he tried to come up with a 
word to describe Edward’s sister. 

“Rosalie.” 

“Whatever. She got real territorial, so Sam and I fell 
back to get Paul’s flanks. Then their leader and the 
other blond male — ” 

113 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Carlisle and Jasper.” 



He gave me an exasperated look. “You know I don’t 
really care. Anyway, so Carlisle spoke to Sam, trying 
to calm things down. Then it was weird, because 
everyone got really calm really fast. It was that other 
one you told me about, messing with our heads. But 
even though we knew what he was doing, we couldn’t 
not be calm.” 

“Yeah, I know how it feels.” 

“Really annoying, that’s how it feels. Only you can’t be 
annoyed until afterwards.” He shook his head angrily. 
“So Sam and the head vamp agreed that Victoria was 
the priority, and we started after her again. Carlisle 
gave us the line, so that we could follow the scent 
properly, but then she hit the cliffs just north of 
Makah country, right where the line hugs the coast 
for a few miles. She took off into the water again. The 
big one and the calm one wanted permission to cross 
the line to go after her, but of course we said no.” 

“Good. I mean, you were being stupid, but I’m glad. 
Emmett’s never cautious enough. He could have 
gotten hurt.” 

Jacob snorted. “So did your vampire tell you we 
attacked for no reason and his totally innocent coven 



“No,” I interrupted. “Edward told me the same story, 
just without quite as many details.” 

“Huh,” Jacob said under his breath, and he bent over 
to pick up a rock from among the millions of pebbles 
at our feet. With a casual flick, he sent it flying a good 
hundred meters out into the bay. “Well, she’ll be 
back, I guess. We’ll get another shot at her.” 

114 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




I shuddered; of course she would be back. Would 
Edward really tell me next time? I wasn’t sure. I’d 
have to keep an eye on Alice, to look for the signs that 
the pattern was about to repeat... . 

Jacob didn’t seem to notice my reaction. He was 
staring across the waves with a thoughtful expression 
on his face, his broad lips pursed. 

“What are you thinking about?” I asked after a long, 
quiet time. 

“I’m thinking about what you told me. About when 
the fortune-teller saw you cliff jumping and thought 
you’d committed suicide, and how it all got out of 
control... . Do you realize that if you had just waited 
for me like you were supposed to, then the bl — Alice 
wouldn’t have been able to see you jump? Nothing 
would have changed. We’d probably be in my garage 
right now, like any other Saturday. There wouldn’t be 
any vampires in Forks, and you and me ...” He trailed 
off, deep in thought. 

It was disconcerting the way he said this, like it would 
be a good thing to have no vampires in Forks. My 
heart thumped unevenly at the emptiness of the 
picture he painted. 

“Edward would have come back anyway.” 

“Are you sure about that?” he asked, belligerent again 
as soon as I spoke Edward’s name. 

“Being apart ... It didn’t work out so well for either of 
us.” 



He started to say something, something angry from 
his expression, but he stopped himself, took a breath, 
and began again. 

115 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Did you know Sam is mad at you?” 

“Me?” It took me a second. “Oh. I see. He thinks they 
would have stayed away if I wasn’t here.” 

“No. That’s not it.” 

“What’s his problem then?” 

Jacob leaned down to scoop up another rock. He 
turned it over and over in his fingers; his eyes were 
riveted on the black stone while he spoke in a low 
voice. 

“When Sam saw . . . how you were in the beginning, 
when Billy told them how Charlie worried when you 
didn’t get better, and then when you started jumping 
off cliffs ...” 

I made a face. No one was ever going to let me forget 
that. 

Jacob’s eyes flashed up to mine. “He thought you 
were the one person in the world with as much 
reason to hate the Cullens as he does. Sam feels sort 
of ... betrayed that you would just let them back into 
your life like they never hurt you.” 

I didn’t believe for a second that Sam was the only 
one who felt that way. And the acid in my voice now 
was for both of them. 

“You can tell Sam to go right to — ” 

“Look at that,” Jacob interrupted me, pointing to an 
eagle in the act of plummeting down toward the ocean 
from an incredible height. It checked itself at the last 
minute, only its talons breaking the surface of the 
waves, just for an instant. Then it flapped away, its 
116 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




wings straining against the load of the huge fish it 
had snagged. 

“You see it everywhere,” Jacob said, his voice 
suddenly distant. “Nature taking its course — hunter 
and prey, the endless cycle of life and death.” 

I didn’t understand the point of the nature lecture; I 
guessed that he was just trying to change the subject. 
But then he looked down at me with dark humor in 
his eyes. 

“And yet, you don’t see the fish trying to plant a kiss 
on the eagle. You never see that.” He grinned a 
mocking grin. 

I grinned back tightly, though the acid taste was still 
in my mouth. “Maybe the fish was trying,” I 
suggested. “It’s hard to tell what a fish is thinking. 
Eagles are good-looking birds, you know.” 

“Is that what it comes down to?” His voice was 
abruptly sharper. “Good looks?” 

“Don’t be stupid, Jacob.” 

“Is it the money, then?” he persisted. 

“That’s nice,” I muttered, getting up from the tree. 

“I’m flattered that you think so much of me.” I turned 
my back on him and paced away. 

“Aw, don’t get mad.” He was right behind me; he 
caught my wrist and spun me around. “I’m serious! 
I’m trying to understand here, and I’m coming up 
blank.” 

His eyebrows pushed together angrily, and his eyes 
were black in their deep shadow. 

117 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I love him. Not because he’s beautiful or because he’s 
rich!” I spat the word at Jacob. “I’d much rather he 
weren’t either one. It would even out the gap between 
us just a little bit — because he’d still be the most 
loving and unselfish and brilliant and decent person 
I’ve ever met. Of course I love him. How hard is that 
to understand?” 

“It’s impossible to understand.” 

“Please enlighten me, then, Jacob.” I let the sarcasm 
flow thick. “What is a valid reason for someone to love 
someone else? Since apparently I’m doing it wrong.” 

“I think the best place to start would be to look within 
your own species. That usually works.” 

“Well, that just sucks!” I snapped. “I guess I’m stuck 
with Mike Newton after all.” 

Jacob flinched back and bit his lip. I could see that 
my words had hurt him, but I was too mad to feel bad 
about that yet. He dropped my wrist and folded his 
arms across his chest, turning from me to glare 
toward the ocean. 

“I’m human,” he muttered, his voice almost inaudible. 

“You’re not as human as Mike,” I continued 
ruthlessly. “Do you still think that’s the most 
important consideration?” 

“It’s not the same thing.” Jacob didn’t look away from 
the gray waves. “I didn’t choose this.” 

I laughed once in disbelief. “Do you think Edward 
did? He didn’t know what was happening to him any 
more than you did. He didn’t exactly sign up for this.” 



118 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jacob was shaking his head back and forth with a 
small, quick movement. 

“You know, Jacob, you’re awfully self-righteous — 
considering that you’re a werewolf and all.” 

“It’s not the same,” Jacob repeated, glowering at me. 

“I don’t see why not. You could be a bit more 
understanding about the Cullens. You have no idea 
how truly good they are — to the core, Jacob.” 

He frowned more deeply. “They shouldn’t exist. Their 
existence goes against nature.” 

I stared at him for a long moment with one eyebrow 
raised incredulously. It was a while before he noticed. 

“What?” 

“Speaking of unnatural ... ,” I hinted. 

“Bella,” he said, his voice slow and different. Aged. I 
realized that he sounded suddenly older than me — 
like a parent or a teacher. “What I am was born in 
me. It’s a part of who I am, who my family is, who we 
all are as a tribe — it’s the reason why we’re still here. 

“Besides that” — he looked down at me, his black 
eyes unreadable — “I am still human.” 

He picked up my hand and pressed it to his fever- 
warm chest. Through his t-shirt, I could feel the 
steady beating of his heart under my palm. 

“Normal humans can’t throw motorcycles around the 
way you can.” 



119 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He smiled a faint, half-smile. “Normal humans run 
away from monsters, Bella. And I never claimed to be 
normal. Just human.” 

Staying angry with Jacob was too much work. I 
started to smile as I pulled my hand away from his 
chest. 

“You look plenty human to me,” I allowed. “At the 
moment.” 

“I feel human.” He stared past me, his face far away. 
His lower lip trembled, and he bit down on it hard. 

“Oh, Jake,” I whispered, reaching for his hand. 

This was why I was here. This was why I would take 
whatever reception waited for me when I got back. 
Because, underneath all the anger and the sarcasm, 
Jacob was in pain. Right now, it was very clear in his 
eyes. I didn’t know how to help him, but I knew I had 
to try. It was more than that I owed him. It was 
because his pain hurt me, too. Jacob had become a 
part of me, and there was no changing that now.

IMPRINT 



“Are you okay, Jake? Charlie said you were having a 
hard time... . Isn’t it getting any better?” 

His warm hand curled around mine. “’S not so bad,” 
he said, but he wouldn’t meet my eyes. 

He walked slowly back to the driftwood bench, staring 
at the rainbow-colored pebbles, and pulling me along 
at his side. I sat back down on our tree, but he sat on 
the wet, rocky ground rather than next to me. I 
wondered if it was so that he could hide his face more 
easily. He kept my hand. 

I started babbling to fill the silence. “It’s been so long 
since I was here. I’ve probably missed a ton of things. 
How are Sam and Emily? And Embry? Did Quil — ?” 

I broke off mid-sentence, remembering that Jacob’s 
friend Quil had been a sensitive subject. 

“Ah, Quil,” Jacob sighed. 

So then it must have happened — Quil must have 
joined the pack. 

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled. 

To my surprise, Jacob snorted. “Don’t say that to 
him.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Quil’s not looking for pity. Just the opposite — he’s 
jazzed. Totally thrilled.” 

121 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



This made no sense to me. All the other wolves had 
been so depressed at the idea of their friend sharing 
their fate. “Huh?” 



Jacob tilted his head back to look at me. He smiled 
and rolled his eyes. 

“Quil thinks it’s the coolest thing that’s ever 
happened to him. Part of it is finally knowing what’s 
going on. And he’s excited to have his friends back — 
to be part of the ‘in crowd.’” Jacob snorted again. 
“Shouldn’t be surprised, I guess. It’s so Quil.” 

“He likes it?” 

“Honestly ... most of them do,” Jacob admitted slowly. 
“There are definitely good sides to this — the speed, 
the freedom, the strength ... the sense of — of 
family. . . . Sam and I are the only ones who ever felt 
really bitter. And Sam got past that a long time ago. 

So I’m the crybaby now.” Jacob laughed at himself. 

There were so many things I wanted to know. “Why 
are you and Sam different? What happened to Sam 
anyway? What’s his problem?” The questions tumbled 
out without room to answer them, and Jacob laughed 
again. 

“That’s a long story.” 

“I told you a long story. Besides, I’m not in any hurry 
to get back,” I said, and then I grimaced as I thought 
of the trouble I would be in. 

He looked up at me swiftly, hearing the double edge 
in my words. “Will he be mad at you?” 

“Yes,” I admitted. “He really hates it when I do things 
he considers ... risky.” 

122 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Like hanging out with werewolves.” 



“Yeah.” 

Jacob shrugged. “So don’t go back. I’ll sleep on the 
couch.” 

“That’s a great idea,” I grumbled. “Because then he 
would come looking for me.” 

Jacob stiffened, and then smiled bleakly. “Would he?” 

“If he was afraid I was hurt or something — 
probably.” 

“My idea’s sounding better all the time.” 

“Please, Jake. That really bugs me.” 

“What does?” 

“That you two are so ready to kill each other!” I 
complained. “It makes me crazy. Why can’t you both 
just be civilized?” 

“Is he ready to kill me?” Jacob asked with a grim 
smile, unconcerned by my anger. 

“Not like you seem to be!” I realized I was yelling. “At 
least he can be a grown-up about this. He knows that 
hurting you would hurt me — and so he never would. 
You don’t seem to care about that at all!” 

“Yeah, right,” Jacob muttered. “I’m sure he’s quite the 
pacifist.” 

“Ugh!” I ripped my hand out of his and shoved his 
head away. Then I pulled my knees up to my chest 
and wrapped my arms tightly around them. 

123 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I glared out toward the horizon, fuming. 

Jacob was quiet for a few minutes. Finally, he got up 
off the ground and sat beside me, putting his arm 
around my shoulders. I shook it off. 

“Sorry,” he said quietly. “Ill try to behave myself.” 

I didn’t answer. 

“Do you still want to hear about Sam?” he offered. 

I shrugged. 

“Like I said, it’s a long story. And very ... strange. 
There ’re so many strange things about this new life. I 
haven’t had time to tell you the half of it. And this 
thing with Sam — well, I don’t know if I’ll even be able 
to explain it right.” 

His words pricked my curiosity in spite of my 
irritation. 

“I’m listening,” I said stiffly. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the side of his face 
pull up in a smile. 

“Sam had it so much harder than the rest of us. 
Because he was the first, and he was alone, and he 
didn’t have anyone to tell him what was happening. 
Sam’s grandfather died before he was born, and his 
father has never been around. There was no one there 
to recognize the signs. The first time it happened — 
the first time he phased — he thought he’d gone 
insane. It took him two weeks to calm down enough 
to change back.

“This was before you came to Forks, so you wouldn’t 
remember. Sam’s mother and Leah Clearwater had 
the forest rangers searching for him, the police. 

People thought there had been an accident or 
something... .” 

“Leah?” I asked, surprised. Leah was Harry’s 
daughter. Hearing her name sent an automatic surge 
of pity through me. Harry Clearwater, Charlie’s life- 
long friend, had died of a heart attack this past 
spring. 

His voice changed, became heavier. “Yeah. Leah and 
Sam were high school sweethearts. They started 
dating when she was just a freshman. She was frantic 
when he disappeared.” 

“But he and Emily — ” 

“I’ll get to that — it’s part of the story,” he said. He 
inhaled slowly, and then exhaled in a gust. 

I supposed it was silly for me to imagine that Sam 
had never loved anyone before Emily. Most people fall 
in and out of love many times in their lives. It was 
just that I’d seen Sam with Emily, and I couldn’t 
imagine him with someone else. The way he looked at 
her ... well, it reminded me of a look I’d seen 
sometimes in Edward’s eyes — when he was looking 
at me. 

“Sam came back,” Jacob said, “but he wouldn’t talk 
to anyone about where he’d been. Rumors flew — that 
he was up to no good, mostly. And then Sam 
happened to run in to Quil’s grandfather one 
afternoon when Old Quil Ateara came to visit Mrs. 
Uley. Sam shook his hand. Old Quil just about had a 
stroke.” Jacob paused to laugh. 



125 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Why?” 



Jacob put his hand on my cheek and pulled my face 
around to look at him — he was leaning toward me, 
his face was just a few inches away. His palm burned 
my skin, like he had a fever. 

“Oh, right,” I said. It was uncomfortable, having my 
face so close to his with his hand hot against my skin. 
“Sam was running a temperature.” 

Jacob laughed again. “Sam’s hand felt like he’d left it 
sitting on a hot stovetop.” 

He was so close, I could feel his warm breath. I 
reached up casually, to take his hand away and free 
my face, but wound my fingers through his so that I 
wouldn’t hurt his feelings. He smiled and leaned 
back, undeceived by my attempt at nonchalance. 

“So Mr. Ateara went straight to the other elders,” 
Jacob went on. “They were the only ones left who still 
knew, who remembered. Mr. Ateara, Billy, and Harry 
had actually seen their grandfathers make the 
change. When Old Quil told them, they met with Sam 
secretly and explained. 

“It was easier when he understood — when he wasn’t 
alone anymore. They knew he wouldn’t be the only 
one affected by the Cullens’ return” — he pronounced 
the name with unconscious bitterness — “but no one 
else was old enough. So Sam waited for the rest of us 
to join him... .” 

“The Cullens had no idea,” I said in a whisper. “They 
didn’t think that werewolves still existed here. They 
didn’t know that coming here would change you.” 

“It doesn’t change the fact that it did.” 

126 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Remind me not to get on your bad side.” 



“You think I should be as forgiving as you are? We 
can’t all be saints and martyrs.” 

“Grow up, Jacob.” 

“I wish I could,” he murmured quietly. 

I stared at him, trying to make sense of his response. 
“What?” 

Jacob chuckled. “One of those many strange things I 
mentioned.” 

“You ... can’t ... grow up?” I said blankly. “You’re 
what? Not ... aging? Is that a joke?” 

“Nope.” He popped his lips on the P. 

I felt blood flood my face. Tears — tears of rage — 
filled my eyes. My teeth mashed together with an 
audible grinding sound. 

“Bella? What did I say?” 

I was on my feet again, my hands balled up into fists, 
my whole frame shaking. 

“You. Are. Not. Aging,” I growled through my teeth. 

Jacob tugged my arm gently, trying to make me sit. 
“None of us are. What’s wrong with you?” 

“Am I the only one who has to get old? I get older 
every stinking day!” I nearly shrieked, throwing my 
hands in the air. Some little part of me recognized 
that I was throwing a Charlie-esque fit, but that 
rational part was greatly overshadowed by the 
127 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




irrational part. “Damn it! What kind of world is this? 
Where’s the justice?” 

“Take it easy, Bella.” 

“Shut up, Jacob. Just shut up! This is so unfair!” 

“Did you seriously just stamp your foot? I thought 
girls only did that on TV.” 

I growled unimpressively. 

“It’s not as bad as you seem to think it is. Sit down 
and I’ll explain.” 

“I’ll stand.” 

He rolled his eyes. “Okay. Whatever you want. But 
listen, I will get older ... someday.” 

“Explain.” 

He patted the tree. I glowered for a second, but then 
sat; my temper had burned out as suddenly as it had 
flared and I’d calmed down enough to realize that I 
was making a fool of myself. 

“When we get enough control to quit ... ,” Jacob said. 
“When we stop phasing for a solid length of time, we 
age again. It’s not easy.” He shook his head, abruptly 
doubtful. “It’s gonna take a really long time to learn 
that kind of restraint, I think. Even Sam’s not there 
yet. ’Course it doesn’t help that there’s a huge coven 
of vampires right down the road. We can’t even think 
about quitting when the tribe needs protectors. But 
you shouldn’t get all bent out of shape about it, 
anyway, because I’m already older than you, 
physically at least.” 



128 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“What are you talking about?” 

“Look at me, Bells. Do I look sixteen?” 

I glanced up and down his mammoth frame, trying to 
be unbiased. “Not exactly, I guess.” 

“Not at all. Because we reach full growth inside of a 
few months when the werewolf gene gets triggered. 

It’s one hell of a growth spurt.” He made a face. 
“Physically, I’m probably twenty-five or something. So 
there’s no need for you to freak out about being too 
old for me for at least another seven years.” 

Twenty-five or something. The idea messed with my 
head. But I remembered that growth spurt — I 
remembered watching him shoot up and fill out right 
before my eyes. I remembered how he would look 
different from one day to the next... . I shook my 
head, feeling dizzy. 

“So, did you want to hear about Sam, or did you want 
to scream at me some more for things that are out of 
my control?” 

I took a deep breath. “Sorry. Age is a touchy subject 
for me. That hit a nerve.” 

Jacob’s eyes tightened, and he looked as if he were 
trying to decide how to word something. 

Since I didn’t want to talk about the truly touchy stuff 
— my plans for the future, or treaties that might be 
broken by said plans, I prompted him. “So once Sam 
understood what was going on, once he had Billy and 
Harry and Mr. Ateara, you said it wasn’t so hard 
anymore. And, like you also said, there are the cool 
parts... .” I hesitated briefly. “Why does Sam hate 



129 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




them so much? Why does he wish I would hate 
them?” 



Jacob sighed. “This is the really weird part.” 

“I’m a pro at weird.” 

“Yeah, I know.” He grinned before he continued. “So, 
you’re right. Sam knew what was going on, and 
everything was almost okay. In most ways, his life 
was back to, well, not normal. But better.” Then 
Jacob’s expression tightened, like something painful 
was coming. “Sam couldn’t tell Leah. We aren’t 
supposed to tell anyone who doesn’t have to know. 
And it wasn’t really safe for him to be around her — 
but he cheated, just like I did with you. Leah was 
furious that he wouldn’t tell her what was going on — 
where he’d been, where he went at night, why he was 
always so exhausted — but they were working it out. 
They were trying. They really loved each other.” 

“Did she find out? Is that what happened?” 

He shook his head. “No, that wasn’t the problem. Her 
cousin, Emily Young, came down from the Makah 
reservation to visit her one weekend.” 

I gasped. “Emily is Leah’s cousin?” 

“Second cousins. They’re close, though. They were 
like sisters when they were kids.” 

“That’s ... horrible. How could Sam ... ?” I trailed off, 
shaking my head. 

“Don’t judge him just yet. Did anyone ever tell you ... 
Have you ever heard of imprinting?” 



130 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Imprinting?” I repeated the unfamiliar word. “No. 
What’s that mean?” 



“It’s one of those bizarre things we have to deal with. 

It doesn’t happen to everyone. In fact, it’s the rare 
exception, not the rule. Sam had heard all the stories 
by then, the stories we all used to think were legends. 
He’d heard of imprinting, but he never dreamed ...” 

“What is it?” I prodded. 

Jacob’s eyes strayed to the ocean. “Sam did love Leah. 
But when he saw Emily, that didn’t matter anymore. 
Sometimes ... we don’t exactly know why ... we find 
our mates that way.” His eyes flashed back to me, his 
face reddening. “I mean ... our soul mates.” 

“What way? Love at first sight?” I snickered. 

Jacob wasn’t smiling. His dark eyes were critical of 
my reaction. “It’s a little bit more powerful than that. 
More absolute.” 

“Sorry,” I muttered. “You’re serious, aren’t you?” 
“Yeah, I am.” 

“Love at first sight? But more powerful?” My voice still 
sounded dubious, and he could hear that. 

“It’s not easy to explain. It doesn’t matter, anyway .” 

He shrugged indifferently. “You wanted to know what 
happened to Sam to make him hate the vampires for 
changing him, to make him hate himself. And that’s 
what happened. He broke Leah’s heart. He went back 
on every promise he’d ever made her. Every day he 
has to see the accusation in her eyes, and know that 
she’s right.” 



131 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He stopped talking abruptly, as if he’d said something 
he hadn’t meant to. 

“How did Emily deal with this? If she was so close to 
Leah ... ?” Sam and Emily were utterly right together, 
two puzzle pieces, shaped for each other exactly. Still 
... how had Emily gotten past the fact that he’d 
belonged to someone else? Her sister, almost. 

“She was real angry, in the beginning. But it’s hard to 
resist that level of commitment and adoration.” Jacob 
sighed. “And then, Sam could tell her everything. 
There are no rules that can bind you when you find 
your other half. You know how she got hurt?” 

“Yeah.” The story in Forks was that she was mauled 
by a bear, but I was in on the secret. 

Werewolves are unstable, Edward had said. The 
people near them get hurt. 

“Well, weirdly enough, that was sort of how they 
resolved things. Sam was so horrified, so sickened by 
himself, so full of hate for what he’d done... . He 
would have thrown himself under a bus if it would 
have made her feel better. He might have anyway, 
just to escape what he’d done. He was shattered... . 
Then, somehow, she was the one comforting him, and 
after that... .” 

Jacob didn’t finish his thought, and I sensed the story 
had gotten too personal to share. 

“Poor Emily,” I whispered. “Poor Sam. Poor Leah... .” 

“Yeah, Leah got the worst end of the stick,” he agreed. 
“She puts on a brave face. She’s going to be a 
bridesmaid.” 



132 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I gazed away, toward the jagged rocks that rose from 
the ocean like stubby broken-off fingers on the south 
rim of the harbor, while I tried to make sense of it all. 
I could feel his eyes on my face, waiting for me to say 
something. 

“Did it happen to you?” I finally asked, still looking 
away. “This love-at-first-sight thing?” 

“No,” he answered briskly. “Sam and Jared are the 
only ones.” 

“Hmm,” I said, trying to sound only politely 
interested. I was relieved, and I tried to explain my 
reaction to myself. I decided I was just glad he didn’t 
claim there was some mystical, wolfy connection 
between the two of us. Our relationship was 
confusing enough as it was. I didn’t need any more of 
the supernatural than I already had to deal with. 

He was quiet, too, and the silence felt a little 
awkward. My intuition told me that I didn’t want to 
hear what he was thinking. 

“How did that work out for Jared?” I asked to break 
the silence. 

“No drama there. It was just a girl he’d sat next to in 
school every day for a year and never looked at twice. 
And then, after he changed, he saw her again and 
never looked away. Kim was thrilled. She’d had a 
huge crush on him. She’d had his last name tacked 
on to the end of hers all over in her diary.” He 
laughed mockingly. 

I frowned. “Did Jared tell you that? He shouldn’t 
have.” 



133 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jacob bit his lip. “I guess I shouldn’t laugh. It was 
funny, though.” 



“Some soul mate.” 

He sighed. “Jared didn’t tell us anything on purpose. I 
already told you this part, remember?” 

“Oh, yeah. You can hear each other’s thoughts, but 
only when you’re wolves, right?” 

“Right. Just like your bloodsucker.” He glowered. 

“Edward,” I corrected. 

“Sure, sure. That’s how come I know so much about 
how Sam felt. It’s not like he would have told us all 
that if he’d had a choice. Actually, that’s something 
we all hate.” The bitterness was abruptly harsh in his 
voice. “It’s awful. No privacy, no secrets. Everything 
you’re ashamed of, laid out for everyone to see.” He 
shuddered. 

“It sounds horrible,” I whispered. 

“It is sometimes helpful when we need to coordinate,” 
he said grudgingly. “Once in a blue moon, when some 
bloodsucker crosses into our territory. Laurent was 
fun. And if the Cullens hadn’t gotten in our way last 
Saturday ... ugh!” he groaned. “We could have had 
her!” His fists clenched into angry balls. 

I flinched. As much as I worried about Jasper or 
Emmett getting hurt, it was nothing like the panic I 
felt at the idea of Jacob going up against Victoria. 
Emmett and Jasper were the closest thing to 
indestructible I could imagine. Jacob was still warm, 
still comparatively human. Mortal. I thought of Jacob 



134 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




facing Victoria, her brilliant hair blowing around her 
oddly feline face ... and shuddered. 

Jacob looked up at me with a curious expression. 
“But isn’t it like that for you all the time? Having him 
in your head?” 

“Oh, no. Edward’s never in my head. He only wishes.” 

Jacob’s expression became confused. 

“He can’t hear me,” I explained, my voice a tiny bit 
smug from old habit. “I’m the only one like that, for 
him. We don’t know why he can’t.” 

“Weird,” Jacob said. 

“Yeah.” The smugness faded. “It probably means 
there’s something wrong with my brain,” I admitted. 

“I already knew there was something wrong with your 
brain,” Jacob muttered. 

“Thanks.” 

The sun broke through the clouds suddenly, a 
surprise I hadn’t been expecting, and I had to narrow 
my eyes against the glare off the water. Everything 
changed color — the waves turned from gray to blue, 
the trees from dull olive to brilliant jade, and the 
rainbow-hued pebbles glittered like jewels. 

We squinted for a moment, letting our eyes adjust. 
There were no sounds besides the hollow roar of the 
waves that echoed from every side of the sheltered 
harbor, the soft grinding of the stones against each 
other under the water’s movement, and the cry of 
gulls high overhead. It was very peaceful. 



135 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jacob settled closer to me, so that he was leaning 
against my arm. He was so warm. After a minute of 
this, I shrugged out of my rain jacket. He made a little 
sound of contentment in the back of his throat, and 
rested his cheek on the top of my head. I could feel 
the sun heat my skin — thought it was not quite as 
warm as Jacob — and I wondered idly how long it 
would take me to burn. 

Absentmindedly, I twisted my right hand to the side, 
and watched the sunlight glitter subtly off the scar 
James had left there. 

“What are you thinking about?” he murmured. 

“The sun.” 

“Mmm. It’s nice.” 

“What are you thinking about?” I asked. 

He chuckled to himself. “I was remembering that 
moronic movie you took me to. And Mike Newton 
puking all over everything.” 

I laughed, too, surprised by how time had changed 
the memory. It used to be one of stress, of confusion. 
So much had changed that night... . And now I could 
laugh. It was the last night Jacob and I had had 
before he’d learned the truth about his heritage. The 
last human memory. An oddly pleasant memory now. 

“I miss that,” Jacob said. “The way it used to be so 
easy ... uncomplicated. I’m glad I’ve got a good 
memory.” He sighed. 

He felt the sudden tension in my body as his words 
triggered a memory of my own. 



136 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“What is it?” he asked. 



“About that good memory of yours ...” I pulled away 
from him so that I could read his face. At the 
moment, it was confused. “Do you mind telling me 
what you were doing Monday morning? You were 
thinking something that bothered Edward.” Bothered 
wasn’t quite the word for it, but I wanted an answer, 
so I thought it was best not to start out too severely. 

Jacob’s face brightened with understanding, and he 
laughed. “I was just thinking about you. Didn’t like 
that much, did he?” 

“Me? What about me?” 

Jacob laughed, with a harder edge this time. “I was 
remembering the way you looked that night Sam 
found you — I’ve seen it in his head, and it’s like I 
was there; that memory has always haunted Sam, 
you know. And then I remembered how you looked 
the first time you came to my place. I bet you don’t 
even realize what a mess you were then, Bella. It was 
weeks before you started to look human again. And I 
remembered how you always used to have your arms 
wrapped around yourself, trying to hold yourself 
together... .” Jacob winced, and then shook his head. 
“It’s hard for me to remember how sad you were, and 
it wasn’t my fault. So I figured it would be harder for 
him. And I thought he ought to get a look at what 
he’d done.” 

I smacked his shoulder. It hurt my hand. “Jacob 
Black, don’t you ever do that again! Promise me you 
won’t.” 

“No way. I haven’t had that much fun in months.” 

“So help me, Jake — ” 

137 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Oh, get a grip, Bella. When am I ever going to see 
him again? Don’t worry about it.” 

I got to my feet, and he caught my hand as I started 
to walk away. I tried to tug free. 

“I’m leaving, Jacob.” 

“No, don’t go yet,” he protested, his hand tightening 
around mine. “I’m sorry. And ... okay, I won’t do it 
again. Promise.” 

I sighed. “Thanks, Jake.” 

“Come on, we’ll go back to my house,” he said eagerly. 

“Actually, I think I really do need to go. Angela Weber 
is expecting me, and I know Alice is worried. I don’t 
want to upset her too much.” 

“But you just got here!” 

“It feels that way,” I agreed. I glared up at the sun, 
somehow already directly overhead. How had the time 
passed so quickly? 

His eyebrows pulled down over his eyes. “I don’t know 
when I’ll see you again,” he said in a hurt voice. 

“I’ll come back the next time he’s away,” I promised 
impulsively. 

“Away?” Jacob rolled his eyes. “That’s a nice way to 
describe what he’s doing. Disgusting parasites.” 

“If you can’t be nice, I won’t come back at all!” I 
threatened, trying to pull my hand free. He refused to 
let go. 



138 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Aw, don’t be mad,” he said, grinning. “Knee-jerk 
reaction.” 

“If I’m going to try to come back again, you’re going to 
have to get something straight, okay?” 

He waited. 

“See,” I explained. “I don’t care who’s a vampire and 
who’s a werewolf. That’s irrelevant. You are Jacob, 
and he is Edward, and I am Bella. And nothing else 
matters.” 

His eyes narrowed slightly. “But I am a werewolf,” he 
said unwillingly. “And he is a vampire,” he added with 
obvious revulsion. 

“And I’m a Virgo!” I shouted, exasperated. 

He raised his eyebrows, measuring my expression 
with curious eyes. Finally, he shrugged. 

“If you can really see it that way ...” 

“I can. I do.” 

“Okay. Just Bella and Jacob. None of those freaky 
Virgos here.” He smiled at me, the warm, familiar 
smile that I had missed so much. I felt the answering 
smile spread across my face. 

“I’ve really missed you, Jake,” I admitted impulsively. 

“Me, too,” his smile widened. His eyes were happy and 
clear, free for once of the angry bitterness. “More than 
you know. Will you come back soon?” 

“As soon as I can,” I promised.

SWITZERLAND 



As I drove home, I wasn't paying much attention to 
the road that shimmered wetly in the sun. I was 
thinking about the flood of information Jacob had 
shared with me, trying to sort it out, to force it all to 
make sense. Despite the overload, I felt lighter. Seeing 
Jacob smile, having all the secrets thrashed out ... it 
didn’t make things perfect, but it made them better. I 
was right to have gone. Jacob needed me. And 
obviously, I thought as I squinted into the glare, there 
was no danger. 

It came out of nowhere. One minute there was 
nothing but bright highway in my rearview mirror. 

The next minute, the sun was glinting off a silver 
Volvo right on my tail. 

“Aw, crap,” I whimpered. 

I considered pulling over. But I was too much of a 
coward to face him right away. I’d been counting on 
some prep time . . . and having Charlie nearby as a 
buffer. At least that would force him to keep his voice 
down. 

The Volvo followed inches behind me. I kept my eyes 
on the road ahead. 

Chicken through and through, I drove straight to 
Angela’s without once meeting the gaze I could feel 
burning a hole in my mirror. 

He followed me until I pulled to the curb in front of 
the Webers’ house. He didn’t stop, and I didn’t look 



140 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



up as he passed. I didn’t want to see the expression 
on his face. I ran up the short concrete walk to 
Angela’s door as soon as he was out of sight. 

Ben answered the door before I could finish knocking, 
like he’d been standing right behind it. 

“Hey, Bella!” he said, surprised. 

“Hi, Ben. Er, is Angela here?” I wondered if Angela 
had forgotten our plans, and cringed at the thought of 
going home early. 

“Sure,” Ben said just as Angela called, “Bella!” and 
appeared at the top of the stairs. 

Ben peered around me as we both heard the sound of 
a car on the road; the sound didn’t scare me — this 
engine stuttered to a stop, followed by the loud pop of 
a backfire. Nothing like the purr of the Volvo. This 
must be the visitor Ben had been waiting for. 

“Austin’s here,” Ben said as Angela reached his side. 

A horn honked on the street. 

“I’ll see you later,” Ben promised. “Miss you already.” 

He threw his arm around Angela’s neck and pulled 
her face down to his height so that he could kiss her 
enthusiastically. After a second of this, Austin honked 
again. 

“Hye, Ang! Love you!” Ben shouted as he dashed past 
me. 

Angela swayed, her face slightly pink, then recovered 
herself and waved until Ben and Austin were out of 
sight. Then she turned to me and grinned ruefully. 

141 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




“Thank you for doing this, Bella,” she said. “From the 
bottom of my heart. Not only are you saving my 
hands from permanent injury, you also just spared 
me two long hours of a plot-less, badly dubbed 
martial arts film.” She sighed in relief. 

“Happy to be of service.” I was feeling a bit less 
panicked, able to breathe a little more evenly. It felt so 
ordinary here. Angela’s easy human dramas were 
oddly reassuring. It was nice to know that life was 
normal somewhere. 

I followed Angela up the stairs to her room. She 
kicked toys out of the way as she went. The house 
was unusually quiet. 

“Where’s your family?” 

“My parents took the twins to a birthday party in Port 
Angeles. I can’t believe you’re really going to help me 
with this. Ben’s pretending he has tendonitis.” She 
made a face. 

“I don’t mind at all,” I said, and then I walked into 
Angela’s room and saw the stacks of waiting 
envelopes. 

“Oh!” I gasped. Angela turned to look at me, apologies 
in her eyes. I could see why she’d been putting this 
off, and why Ben had weaseled out. 

“I thought you were exaggerating,” I admitted. 

“I wish. Are you sure you want to do this?” 

“Put me to work. I’ve got all day.” 

Angela divided a pile in half and put her mother’s 
address book between us on her desk. For a while we 

142 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




concentrated, and there was just the sound of our 
pens scratching quietly across the paper. 

“What’s Edward doing tonight?” she asked after a few 
minutes. 

My pen dug into the envelope I was working on. 
“Emmet’s home for the weekend. They’re supposed to 
be hiking.” 

“You say that like you’re not sure.” 

I shrugged. 

“You’re lucky Edward has his brothers for all the 
hiking and camping. I don’t know what I’d do if Ben 
didn’t have Austin for the guy stuff.” 

“Yeah, the outdoors thing is not really for me. And 
there’s no way I’d ever be able to keep up.” 

Angela laughed. “I prefer the indoors myself.” 

She focused on her pile for a minute. I wrote out four 
more addresses. There was never any pressure to fill 
a pause with meaningless chatter around Angela. 

Like Charlie, she was comfortable with silence. 

But, like Charlie, she was also too observant 
sometimes. 

“Is something wrong?” she asked in a low voice now. 
“You seem ... anxious.” 

I smiled sheepishly. “Is it that obvious?” 

“Not really.” 



She was probably lying to make me feel better.

“You don’t have to talk about it unless you want to,” 
she assured me. “I’ll listen if you think it will help.” 

I was about to say thanks, but no thanks. After all, 
there were just too many secrets I was bound to keep. 
I really couldn’t discuss my problems with someone 
human. That was against the rules. 

And yet, with a strange, sudden intensity, that’s 
exactly what I wanted. I wanted to talk to a normal 
human girlfriend. I wanted to moan a little bit, like 
any other teenage girl. I wanted my problems to be 
that simple. It would also be nice to have someone 
outside the whole vampire-werewolf mess to put 
things in perspective. Someone unbiased. 

“I’ll mind my own business,” Angela promised, smiling 
down at the address she was working on. 

“No,” I said. “You’re right. I am anxious. It’s ... it’s 
Edward.” 

“What’s wrong?” 

It was so easy to talk to Angela. When she asked a 
question like that, I could tell that she wasn’t just 
morbidly curious or looking for gossip, like Jessica 
would have been. She cared that I was upset. 

“Oh, he’s mad at me.” 

“That’s hard to imagine,” she said. “What’s he mad 
about?” 

I sighed. “Do you remember Jacob Black?” 

“Ah,” she said. 

“Yeah.”

Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“He’s jealous.” 

“No, not jealous ...” I should have kept my mouth 
shut. There was no way to explain this right. But I 
wanted to keep talking anyway. I hadn’t realized I was 
so starved for human conversation. “Edward thinks 
Jacob is ... a bad influence, I guess. Sort of ... 
dangerous. You know how much trouble I got in a few 
months back... . It’s all ridiculous, though.” 

I was surprised to see Angela shaking her head. 

“What?” I asked. 

“Bella, I’ve seen how Jacob Black looks at you. I’d bet 
the real problem is jealousy.” 

“It’s not like that with Jacob.” 

“For you, maybe. But for Jacob ...” 

I frowned. “Jacob knows how I feel. I’ve told him 
everything.” 

“Edward’s only human, Bella. He’s going to react like 
any other boy.” 

I grimaced. I didn’t have a response to that. 

She patted my hand. “He’ll get over it.” 

“I hope so. Jake’s going through kind of a tough time. 
He needs me.” 

“You and Jacob are pretty close, aren’t you?” 

“Like family,” I agreed. 



145 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“And Edward doesn’t like him... . That must be hard. 

I wonder how Ben would handle that?” she mused. 

I half-smiled. “Probably just like any other boy.” 

She grinned. “Probably.” 

Then she changed the subject. Angela wasn’t one to 
pry, and she seemed to sense I wouldn’t — couldn’t — 
say any more. 

“I got my dorm assignment yesterday. The farthest 
building from campus, naturally.” 

“Does Ben know where he’s staying yet?” 

“The closest dorm to campus. He’s got all the luck. 
How about you? Did you decide where you’re going?” 

I stared down, concentrating on the clumsy scrawl of 
my handwriting. For a second I was distracted by the 
thought of Angela and Ben at the University of 
Washington. They would be off to Seattle in just a few 
months. Would it be safe then? Would the wild young 
vampire menace have moved elsewhere? Would there 
be a new place by then, some other city flinching from 
horror-movie headlines? 

Would those new headlines be my fault? 

I tried to shake it off and answered her question a 
beat late. “Alaska, I think. The university there in 
Juneau.” 

I could hear the surprise in her voice. “Alaska? Oh. 
Really? I mean, that’s great. I just figured you’d go 
somewhere ... warmer.” 



146 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I laughed a little, still staring at the envelope. “Yeah. 
Forks has really changed my perspective on life.” 

“And Edward?” 

Though his name set butterflies fluttering in my 
stomach, I looked up and grinned at her. “Alaska’s 
not too cold for Edward, either.” 

She grinned back. “Of course not.” And then she 
sighed. “It’s so far. You won’t be able to come home 
very often. I’ll miss you. Will you e-mail me?” 

A swell of quiet sadness crashed over me; maybe it 
was a mistake to get closer to Angela now. But 
wouldn’t it be sadder still to miss out on these last 
chances? I shook off the unhappy thoughts, so that I 
could answer her teasingly. 

“If I can type again after this.” I nodded toward the 
stack of envelopes I’d done. 

We laughed, and it was easy then to chat cheerfully 
about classes and majors while we finished the rest — 
all I had to do was not think about it. Anyway, there 
were more urgent things to worry about today. 

I helped her put the stamps on, too. I was afraid to 
leave. 

“How’s your hand?” she asked. 

I flexed my fingers. “I think I’ll recover the full use of 
it ... someday.” 

The door banged downstairs, and we both looked up. 
“Ang?” Ben called. 



147 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I tried to smile, but my lips trembled. “I guess that’s 
my cue to leave.” 



“You don’t have to go. Though he’s probably going to 
describe the movie for me ... in detail.” 

“Charlie will be wondering where I am anyway.” 

“Thanks for helping me.” 

“I had a good time, actually. We should do something 
like this again. It was nice to have some girl time.” 

“Definitely.” 

There was a light knock on the bedroom door. 

“Come in, Ben,” Angela said. 

I got up and stretched. 

“Hey, Bella! You survived,” Ben greeted me quickly 
before going to take my place by Angela. He eyed our 
work. “Nice job. Too bad there’s nothing left to do, I 
would have ...” He let the thought trail off, and then 
restarted excitedly. “Ang, I can’t believe you missed 
this one! It was awesome. There was this final fight 
sequence — the choreography was unbelievable! This 
one guy — well, you’re going to have to see it to know 
what I’m talking about — ” 

Angela rolled her eyes at me. 

“See you at school,” I said with a nervous laugh. 

She sighed. “See you.” 

I was jumpy on the way out to my truck, but the 
street was empty. I spent the whole drive glancing 

148 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




anxiously in all my mirrors, but there was never any 
sign of the silver car. 

His car was not in front of the house, either, though 
that meant little. 

“Bella?” Charlie called when I opened the front door. 
“Hey, Dad.” 

I found him in the living room, in front of the TV. 

“So, how was your day?” 

“Good,” I said. Might as well tell him everything — 
he’d hear it from Billy soon enough. Besides, it would 
make him happy. “They didn’t need me at work, so I 
went down to La Push.” 

There wasn’t enough surprise in his face. Billy had 
already talked to him. 

“How’s Jacob?” Charlie asked, attempting to sound 
indifferent. 

“Good,” I said, just as casual. 

“You get over to the Webers’?” 

“Yep. We got all her announcements addressed.” 

“That’s nice.” Charlie smiled a wide smile. He was 
strangely focused, considering that there was a game 
on. “I’m glad you spent some time with your friends 
today.” 

“Me, too.” 



149 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I ambled toward the kitchen, looking for busy work. 
Unfortunately, Charlie had already cleaned up his 
lunch. I stood there for a few minutes, staring at the 
bright patch of light the sun made on the floor. But I 
knew I couldn’t delay this forever. 

“I’m going to go study,” I announced glumly as I 
headed up the stairs. 

“See you later,” Charlie called after me. 

If I survive, I thought to myself. 

I shut my bedroom door carefully before I turned to 
face my room. 

Of course he was there. He stood against the wall 
across from me, in the shadow beside the open 
window. His face was hard and his posture tense. He 
glared at me wordlessly. 

I cringed, waiting for the torrent, but it didn’t come. 

He just continued to glare, possibly too angry to 
speak. 

“Hi,” I finally said. 

His face could have been carved from stone. I counted 
to a hundred in my head, but there was no change. 

“Er ... so, I’m still alive,” I began. 

A growl rumbled low in his chest, but his expression 
didn’t change. 

“No harm done,” I insisted with a shrug. 

He moved. His eyes closed, and he pinched the bridge 
of his nose between the fingers of his right hand. 

150 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




“Bella,” he whispered. “Do you have any idea how 
close I came to crossing the line today? To breaking 
the treaty and coming after you? Do you know what 
that would have meant?” 

I gasped and his eyes opened. They were as cold and 
hard as night. 

“You can’t!” I said too loudly. I worked to modulate 
the volume of my voice so Charlie wouldn’t hear, but I 
wanted to shout the words. “Edward, they’d use any 
excuse for a fight. They’d love that. You can’t ever 
break the rules!” 

“Maybe they aren’t the only ones who would enjoy a 
fight.” 

“Don’t you start,” I snapped. “You made the treaty — 
you stick to it.” 

“If he’d hurt you — ” 

“Enough!” I cut him off. “There’s nothing to worry 
about. Jacob isn’t dangerous.” 

“Bella.” He rolled his eyes. “You aren’t exactly the best 
judge of what is or isn’t dangerous.” 

“I know I don’t have to worry about Jake. And neither 
do you.” 

He ground his teeth together. His hands were balled 
up in fists at his sides. He was still standing against 
the wall, and I hated the space between us. 

I took a deep breath, and crossed the room. He didn’t 
move when I wrapped my arms around him. Next to 
the warmth of the last of the afternoon sun streaming 



151 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




through the window, his skin felt especially icy. He 
seemed like ice, too, frozen the way he was. 

“I’m sorry I made you anxious,” I muttered. 

He sighed, and relaxed a little. His arms wound 
around my waist. 

“Anxious is a bit of an understatement,” he 
murmured. “It was a very long day.” 

“You weren’t supposed to know about it,” I reminded 
him. “I thought you’d be hunting longer.” 

I looked up at his face, at his defensive eyes; I hadn’t 
noticed in the stress of the moment, but they were too 
dark. The rings under them were deep purple. I 
frowned in disapproval. 

“When Alice saw you disappear, I came back,” he 
explained. 

“You shouldn’t have done that. Now you’ll have to go 
away again.” My frown intensified. 

“I can wait.” 

“That’s ridiculous. I mean, I know she couldn’t see me 
with Jacob, but you should have known — ” 

“But I didn’t,” he broke in. “And you can’t expect me 
to let you — ” 

“Oh, yes, I can,” I interrupted him. “That’s exactly 
what I expect — ” 

“This won’t happen again.” 



152 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“That’s right! Because you’re not going to overreact 
next time.” 

“Because there isn’t going to be a next time.” 

“I understand when you have to leave, even if I don’t 
like it — ” 

“That’s not the same. I’m not risking my life.” 
“Neither am I.” 

“Werewolves constitute a risk.” 

“I disagree.” 

“I’m not negotiating this, Bella.” 

“Neither am I.” 

His hands were in fists again. I could feel them 
against my back. 

The words popped out thoughtlessly. “Is this really 
just about my safety?” 

“What do you mean?” he demanded. 

“You aren’t ...” Angela’s theory seemed sillier now 
than before. It was hard to finish the thought. “I 
mean, you know better than to be jealous, right?” 

He raised one eyebrow. “Do I?” 

“Be serious.” 

“Easily — there’s nothing remotely humorous about 
this.” 



153 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I frowned suspiciously. “Or ... is this something else 
altogether? Some vampires-and-werewolves-are- 
always-enemies nonsense? Is this just a testosterone- 
fueled — ” 

His eyes blazed. “This is only about you. All I care is 
that you’re safe.” 

The black fire in his eyes was impossible to doubt. 

“Okay,” I sighed. “I believe that. But I want you to 
know something — when it comes to all this enemies 
nonsense, I’m out. I am a neutral country. I am 
Switzerland. I refuse to be affected by territorial 
disputes between mythical creatures. Jacob is family. 
You are ... well, not exactly the love of my life, 
because I expect to love you for much longer than 
that. The love of my existence. I don’t care who’s a 
werewolf and who’s a vampire. If Angela turns out to 
be a witch, she can join the party, too.” 

He stared at me silently through narrowed eyes. 

“Switzerland,” I repeated again for emphasis. 

He frowned at me, and then sighed. “Bella ... ,” he 
began, but he paused, and his nose wrinkled in 
disgust. 

“What now?” 

“Well ... don’t be offended, but you smell like a dog,” 
he told me. 

And then he smiled crookedly, so I knew the fight was 
over. For now. 

Edward had to make up for the missed hunting trip, 
and so he was leaving Friday night with Jasper, 

154 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Emmett, and Carlisle to hit some reserve in Northern 
California with a mountain lion problem. 

We’d come to no agreement on the werewolf issue, but 
I didn’t feel guilty calling Jake — during my brief 
window of opportunity when Edward took the Volvo 
home before climbing back in through my window — 
to let him know I’d be coming over on Saturday again. 
It wasn’t sneaking around. Edward knew how I felt. 
And if he broke my truck again, then I’d have Jacob 
pick me up. Forks was neutral, just like Switzerland 
— just like me. 

So when I got off work Thursday and it was Alice 
rather than Edward waiting for me in the Volvo, I was 
not suspicious at first. The passenger door was open, 
and music I didn’t recognize was shaking the frame 
when the bass played. 

“Hey, Alice,” I shouted over the wailing as I climbed 
in. “Where’s your brother?” 

She was singing along to the song, her voice an octave 
higher than the melody, weaving through it with a 
complicated harmony. She nodded at me, ignoring my 
question as she concentrated on the music. 

I shut my door and put my hands over my ears. She 
grinned, and turned the volume down until it was just 
background. Then she hit the locks and the gas in the 
same second. 

“What’s going on?” I asked, starting to feel uneasy. 
“Where is Edward?” 

She shrugged. “They left early.” 



155 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Oh.” I tried to control the absurd disappointment. If 
he left early, that meant he’d be back sooner, I 
reminded myself. 

“All the boys went, and we’re having a slumber party!” 
she announced in a trilling, singsong voice. 

“A slumber party?” I repeated, the suspicion finally 
settling in. 

“Aren’t you excited?” she crowed. 

I met her animated gaze for a long second. 

“You’re kidnapping me, aren’t you?” 

She laughed and nodded. “Till Saturday. Esme 
cleared it with Charlie; you’re staying with me two 
nights, and I will drive you to and from school 
tomorrow.” 

I turned my face to the window, my teeth grinding 
together. 

“Sorry,” Alice said, not sounding in the least bit 
penitent. “He paid me off.” 

“How?” I hissed through my teeth. 

“The Porsche. It’s exactly like the one I stole in Italy.” 
She sighed happily. “I’m not supposed to drive it 
around Forks, but if you want, we could see how long 
it takes to get from here to L.A. — I bet I could have 
you back by midnight.” 

I took a deep breath. “I think I’ll pass,” I sighed, 
repressing a shudder. 



156 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




We wound, always too fast, down the long drive. Alice 
pulled around to the garage, and I quickly looked over 
the cars. Emmett’s big jeep was there, with a shiny 
canary yellow Porsche between it and Rosalie’s red 
convertible. 

Alice hopped out gracefully and went to stroke her 
hand along the length of her bribe. “Pretty, isn’t it?” 

“Pretty over-the-top,” I grumbled, incredulous. “He 
gave you that just for two days of holding me 
hostage?” 

Alice made a face. 

A second later, comprehension came and I gasped in 
horror. “It’s for every time he’s gone, isn’t it?” 

She nodded. 

I slammed my door and stomped toward the house. 
She danced along next to me, still unrepentant. 

“Alice, don’t you think this is just a little bit 
controlling? Just a tiny bit psychotic, maybe?” 

“Not really.” She sniffed. “You don’t seem to grasp 
how dangerous a young werewolf can be. Especially 
when I can’t see them. Edward has no way to know if 
you’re safe. You shouldn’t be so reckless.” 

My voice turned acidic. “Yes, because a vampire 
slumber party is the pinnacle of safety conscious 
behavior.” 

Alice laughed. “I’ll give you a pedicure and 
everything,” she promised. 



157 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




It wasn’t so bad, except for the fact that I was being 
held against my will. Esme brought Italian food — the 
good stuff, all the way from Port Angeles — and Alice 
was prepared with my favorite movies. Even Rosalie 
was there, quietly in the background. Alice did insist 
on the pedicure, and I wondered if she was working 
from a list — maybe something she’d compiled from 
watching bad sitcoms. 

“How late do you want to stay up?” she asked when 
my toenails were glistening a bloody red. Her 
enthusiasm remained untouched by my mood. 

“I don’t want to stay up. We have school in the 
morning.” 

She pouted. 

“Where am I supposed to sleep, anyway?” I measured 
the couch with my eyes. It was a little short. “Can’t 
you just keep me under surveillance at my house?” 

“What kind of a slumber party would that be?” Alice 
shook her head in exasperation. “You’re sleeping in 
Edward’s room.” 

I sighed. His black leather sofa was longer than this 
one. Actually, the gold carpet in his room was 
probably thick enough that the floor wouldn’t be half 
bad either. 

“Can I go back to my place to get my things, at least?” 
She grinned. “Already taken care of.” 

“Am I allowed to use your phone?” 

“Charlie knows where you are.” 



158 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I wasn’t going to call Charlie.” I frowned. “Apparently, 
I have some plans to cancel.” 

“Oh.” She deliberated. “I’m not sure about that.” 

“Alice!” I whined loudly. “C’mon!” 

“Okay, okay,” she said, flitting from the room. She 
was back in half a second, cell phone in hand. “He 
didn’t specifically prohibit this ... ,” she murmured to 
herself as she handed it to me. 

I dialed Jacob’s number, hoping he wasn’t out 
running with his friends tonight. Luck was with me — 
Jacob was the one to answer. 

“Hello?” 

“Hey, Jake, it’s me.” Alice watched me with 
expressionless eyes for a second, before she turned 
and went to sit between Rosalie and Esme on the 
sofa. 

“Hi, Bella,” Jacob said, suddenly cautious. “What’s 
up?” 

“Nothing good. I can’t come over Saturday after all.” 

It was silent for a minute. “Stupid bloodsucker,” he 
finally muttered. “I thought he was leaving. Can’t you 
have a life when he’s gone? Or does he lock you in a 
coffin?” 

I laughed. 

“I don’t think that’s funny.” 



159 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




‘Tm only laughing because you’re close,” I told him. 
“But he’s going to be here Saturday, so it doesn’t 
matter.” 

“Will he be feeding there in Forks, then?” Jacob asked 
cuttingly. 

“No.” I didn’t let myself get irritated with him. I wasn’t 
that far from being as angry as he was. “He left early.” 

“Oh. Well, hey, come over now, then,” he said with 
sudden enthusiasm. “It’s not that late. Or I’ll come up 
to Charlie’s.” 

“I wish. I’m not at Charlie’s,” I said sourly. “I’m kind 
of being held prisoner.” 

He was silent as that sunk in, and then he growled. 
“Well come and get you,” he promised in a flat voice, 
slipping automatically into a plural. 

A chill slid down my spine, but I answered in a light 
and teasing voice. “Tempting. I have been tortured — 
Alice painted my toenails.” 

“I’m serious.” 

“Don’t be. They’re just trying to keep me safe.” 

He growled again. 

“I know it’s silly, but their hearts are in the right 
place.” 

“Their hearts!” he scoffed. 

“Sorry about Saturday,” I apologized. “I’ve got to hit 
the sack” — the couch, I corrected mentally — “but I’ll 
call you again soon.” 

160 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Are you sure they’ll let you?” he asked in a scathing 
tone. 



“Not completely.” I sighed. “’Night, Jake.” 

“See you around.” 

Alice was abruptly at my side, her hand held out for 
the phone, but I was already dialing. She saw the 
number. 

“I don’t think he’ll have his phone on him,” she said. 
“I’ll leave a message.” 

The phone rang four times, followed by a beep. There 
was no greeting. 

“You are in trouble,” I said slowly, emphasizing each 
word. “Enormous trouble. Angry grizzly bears are 
going to look tame next to what is waiting for you at 
home.” 

I snapped the phone shut and placed it in her waiting 
hand. “I’m done.” 

She grinned. “This hostage stuff is fun.” 

“I’m going to sleep now,” I announced, heading for the 
stairs. Alice tagged along. 

“Alice,” I sighed. “I’m not going to sneak out. You 
would know if I was planning to, and you’d catch me 
if I tried.” 

“I’m just going to show you where your things are,” 
she said innocently. 



161 | P a g e

Edward’s room was at the farthest end of the third 
floor hallway, hard to mistake even when the huge 
house had been less familiar. But when I switched the 
light on, I paused in confusion. Had I picked the 
wrong door? 

Alice giggled. 

It was the same room, I realized quickly; the furniture 
had just been rearranged. The couch was pushed to 
the north wall and the stereo shoved up against the 
vast shelves of CDs — to make room for the colossal 
bed that now dominated the central space. 

The southern wall of glass reflected the scene back 
like a mirror, making it look twice as bad. 

It matched. The coverlet was a dull gold, just lighter 
than the walls; the frame was black, made of 
intricately patterned wrought iron. Sculpted metal 
roses wound in vines up the tall posts and formed a 
bowery lattice overhead. My pajamas were folded 
neatly on the foot of the bed, my bag of toiletries to 
one side. 

“What the hell is all this?” I spluttered. 

“You didn’t really think he would make you sleep on 
the couch, did you?” 

I mumbled unintelligibly as I stalked forward to 
snatch my things off the bed. 

“I’ll give you some privacy,” Alice laughed. “See you in 
the morning.” 

After my teeth were brushed and I was dressed, I 
grabbed a puffy feather pillow off the huge bed and 
dragged the gold cover to the couch. I knew I was 

162 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




being silly, but I didn’t care. Porsches as bribes and 
king-sized beds in houses where nobody slept — it 
was beyond irritating. I flipped off the lights and 
curled up on the sofa, wondering if I was too annoyed 
to sleep. 

In the dark, the glass wall was no longer a black 
mirror, doubling the room. The light of the moon 
brightened the clouds outside the window. As my eyes 
adjusted, I could see the diffused glow highlighting 
the tops of the trees, and glinting off a small slice of 
the river. I watched the silver light, waiting for my 
eyes to get heavy. 

There was a light knock on the door. 

“What, Alice?” I hissed. I was on the defensive, 
imagining her amusement when she saw my 
makeshift bed. 

“It’s me,” Rosalie said softly, opening the door enough 
that I could see the silver glow touch her perfect face. 
“Can I come in?”

UNHAPPY ENDING 



7 



Rosalie hesitated in the doorway, her breathtaking 
face unsure. 

“Of course,” I replied, my voice an octave high with 
surprise. “Come on in.” 

I sat up, sliding to the end of the sofa to make room. 
My stomach twisted nervously as the one Cullen who 
did not like me moved silently to sit down in the open 
space. I tried to come up with a reason why she 
would want to see me, but my mind was a blank on 
that point. 

“Do you mind talking to me for a few minutes?” she 
asked. “I didn’t wake you or anything, did I?” Her eyes 
shifted to the stripped bed and back to my couch. 

“No, I was awake. Sure, we can talk.” I wondered if 
she could hear the alarm in my voice as clearly as I 
could. 

She laughed lightly, and it sounded like a chorus of 
bells. “He so rarely leaves you alone,” she said. “I 
figured I’d better make the best of this opportunity.” 

What did she want to say that couldn’t be said in 
front of Edward? My hands twisted and untwisted 
around the edge of the comforter. 

“Please don’t think I’m horribly interfering,” Rosalie 
said, her voice gentle and almost pleading. She folded 
her hands in her lap and looked down at them as she 
spoke. “I’m sure I’ve hurt your feelings enough in the 
past, and I don’t want to do that again.” 

164 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



“Don’t worry about it, Rosalie. My feelings are great. 
What is it?” 



She laughed again, sounding oddly embarrassed. “I’m 
going to try to tell you why I think you should stay 
human — why I would stay human if I were you.” 

“Oh.” 

She smiled at the shocked tone of my voice, and then 
she sighed. 

“Did Edward ever tell you what led to this?” she 
asked, gesturing to her glorious immortal body. 

I nodded slowly, suddenly somber. “He said it was 
close to what happened to me that time in Port 
Angeles, only no one was there to save you.” I 
shuddered at the memory. 

“Is that really all he told you?” she asked. 

“Yes,” I said, my voice blank with confusion. “Was 
there more?” 

She looked up at me and smiled; it was a harsh, 
bitter — but still stunning — expression. 

“Yes,” she said. “There was more.” 

I waited while she stared out the window. She seemed 
to be trying to calm herself. 

“Would you like to hear my story, Bella? It doesn’t 
have a happy ending — but which of ours does? If we 
had happy endings, we’d all be under gravestones 
now.” 



165 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I nodded, though I was frightened by the edge in her 
voice. 

“I lived in a different world than you do, Bella. My 
human world was a much simpler place. It was 
nineteen thirty-three. I was eighteen, and I was 
beautiful. My life was perfect.” 

She stared out the window at the silver clouds, her 
expression far away. 

“My parents were thoroughly middle class. My father 
had a stable job in a bank, something I realize now 
that he was smug about — he saw his prosperity as a 
reward for talent and hard work, rather than 
acknowledging the luck involved. I took it all for 
granted then; in my home, it was as if the Great 
Depression was only a troublesome rumor. Of course 
I saw the poor people, the ones who weren’t as lucky. 
My father left me with the impression that they’d 
brought their troubles on themselves. 

“It was my mother’s job to keep our house — and 
myself and my two younger brothers — in spotless 
order. It was clear that I was both her first priority 
and her favorite. I didn’t fully understand at the time, 
but I was always vaguely aware that my parents 
weren’t satisfied with what they had, even if it was so 
much more than most. They wanted more. They had 
social aspirations — social climbers, I suppose you 
could call them. My beauty was like a gift to them. 
They saw so much more potential in it than I did. 

“They weren’t satisfied, but I was. I was thrilled to be 
me, to be Rosalie Hale. Pleased that men’s eyes 
watched me everywhere I went, from the year I turned 
twelve. Delighted that my girlfriends sighed with envy 
when they touched my hair. Happy that my mother

Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




was proud of me and that my father liked to buy me 
pretty dresses. 



“I knew what I wanted out of life, and there didn’t 
seem to be any way that I wouldn’t get exactly what I 
wanted. I wanted to be loved, to be adored. I wanted 
to have a huge, flowery wedding, where everyone in 
town would watch me walk down the aisle on my 
father’s arm and think I was the most beautiful thing 
they’d ever seen. Admiration was like air to me, Bella. 

I was silly and shallow, but I was content.” She 
smiled, amused at her own evaluation. 

“My parents’ influence had been such that I also 
wanted the material things of life. I wanted a big 
house with elegant furnishings that someone else 
would clean and a modern kitchen that someone else 
would cook in. As I said, shallow. Young and very 
shallow. And I didn’t see any reason why I wouldn’t 
get these things. 

“There were a few things I wanted that were more 
meaningful. One thing in particular. My very closest 
friend was a girl named Vera. She married young, just 
seventeen. She married a man my parents would 
never have considered for me — a carpenter. A year 
later she had a son, a beautiful little boy with dimples 
and curly black hair. It was the first time I’d ever felt 
truly jealous of anyone else in my entire life.” 

She looked at me with unfathomable eyes. “It was a 
different time. I was the same age as you, but I was 
ready for it all. I yearned for my own little baby. I 
wanted my own house and a husband who would kiss 
me when he got home from work — just like Vera. 
Only I had a very different kind of house in mind... .” 

It was hard for me to imagine the world that Rosalie 
had known. Her story sounded more like a fairy tale 

167 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




than history to me. With a slight shock, I realized that 
this was very close to the world that Edward would 
have experienced when he was human, the world he 
had grown up in. I wondered — while Rosalie sat 
silent for a moment — if my world seemed as baffling 
to him as Rosalie’s did to me? 

Rosalie sighed, and when she spoke again her voice 
was different, the wistfulness gone. 

“In Rochester, there was one royal family — the 
Kings, ironically enough. Royce King owned the bank 
my father worked at, and nearly every other really 
profitable business in town. That’s how his son, 

Royce King the Second” — her mouth twisted around 
the name, it came out through her teeth — “saw me 
the first time. He was going to take over at the bank, 
and so he began overseeing the different positions. 
Two days later, my mother conveniently forgot to send 
my father’s lunch to work with him. I remember being 
confused when she insisted that I wear my white 
organza and roll my hair up just to run over to the 
bank.” Rosalie laughed without humor. 

“I didn’t notice Royce watching me particularly. 
Everyone watched me. But that night the first of the 
roses came. Every night of our courtship, he sent a 
bouquet of roses to me. My room was always 
overflowing with them. It got to the point that I would 
smell like roses when I left the house. 

“Royce was handsome, too. He had lighter hair than I 
did, and pale blue eyes. He said my eyes were like 
violets, and then those started showing up alongside 
the roses. 

“My parents approved — that’s putting it mildly. This 
was everything they’d dreamed of. And Royce seemed 
to be everything I’d dreamed of. The fairy tale prince, 

168 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




come to make me a princess. Everything I wanted, yet 
it was still no more than I expected. We were engaged 
before I’d known him for two months. 

“We didn’t spend a great deal of time alone with each 
other. Royce told me he had many responsibilities at 
work, and, when we were together, he liked people to 
look at us, to see me on his arm. I liked that, too. 
There were lots of parties, dancing, and pretty 
dresses. When you were a King, every door was open 
for you, every red carpet rolled out to greet you. 

“It wasn’t a long engagement. Plans went ahead for 
the most lavish wedding. It was going to be everything 
I’d ever wanted. I was completely happy. When I 
called at Vera’s, I no longer felt jealous. I pictured my 
fair-haired children playing on the huge lawns of the 
Kings’ estate, and I pitied her.” 

Rosalie broke off suddenly, clenching her teeth 
together. It pulled me out of her story, and I realized 
that the horror was not far off. There would be no 
happy ending, as she’d promised. I wondered if this 
was why she had so much more bitterness in her 
than the rest of them — because she’d been within 
reach of everything she’d wanted when her human life 
was cut short. 

“I was at Vera’s that night,” Rosalie whispered. Her 
face was smooth as marble, and as hard. “Her little 
Henry really was adorable, all smiles and dimples — 
he was just sitting up on his own. Vera walked me to 
the door as I was leaving, her baby in her arms and 
her husband at her side, his arm around her waist. 

He kissed her on the cheek when he thought I wasn’t 
looking. That bothered me. When Royce kissed me, it 
wasn’t quite the same — not so sweet somehow... . I 
shoved that thought aside. Royce was my prince. 
Someday, I would be queen.” 

169 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




It was hard to tell in the moonlight, but it looked like 
her bone white face got paler. 

“It was dark in the streets, the lamps already on. I 
hadn’t realized how late it was.” She continued to 
whisper almost inaudibly. “It was cold, too. Very cold 
for late April. The wedding was only a week away, and 
I was worrying about the weather as I hurried home 
— I can remember that clearly. I remember every 
detail about that night. I clung to it so hard ... in the 
beginning. I thought of nothing else. And so I 
remember this, when so many pleasant memories 
have faded away completely... .” 

She sighed, and began whispering again. “Yes, I was 
worrying about the weather... . I didn’t want to have 
to move the wedding indoors... . 

“I was a few streets from my house when I heard 

them. A cluster of men under a broken streetlamp, 
laughing too loud. Drunk. I wished I’d called my 
father to escort me home, but the way was so short, it 
seemed silly. And then he called my name. 

‘“Rose!’ he yelled, and the others laughed stupidly. 

“I hadn’t realized the drunks were so well dressed. It 
was Royce and some of his friends, sons of other rich 
men. 

‘“Here’s my Rose!’ Royce shouted, laughing with them, 
sounding just as stupid. You ’re late. We’re cold, 
you’ve kept us waiting so long.’” 

“I’d never seen him drink before. A toast, now and 

then, at a party. He’d told me he didn’t like 
champagne. I hadn’t realized that he preferred 
something much stronger. 



170 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“He had a new friend — the friend of a friend, come 
up from Atlanta. 



“What did I tell you, John,’ Royce crowed, grabbing 
my arm and pulling me closer. ‘Isn’t she lovelier than 
all your Georgia peaches?’ 

“The man named John was dark-haired and 
suntanned. He looked me over like I was a horse he 
was buying. 

“‘It’s hard to tell,’ he drawled slowly. ‘She’s all covered 
up.’ 

“They laughed, Royce like the rest. 

“Suddenly, Royce ripped my jacket from my shoulders 
— it was a gift from him — popping the brass buttons 
off. They scattered all over the street. 

“‘Show him what you look like, Rose!’ He laughed 
again and then he tore my hat out of my hair. The 
pins wrenched my hair from the roots, and I cried out 
in pain. They seemed to enjoy that — the sound of my 
pain... .” 

Rosalie looked at me suddenly, as if she’d forgotten I 
was there. I was sure my face was as white as hers. 
Unless it was green. 

“I won’t make you listen to the rest,” she said quietly. 
“They left me in the street, still laughing as they 
stumbled away. They thought I was dead. They were 
teasing Royce that he would have to find a new bride. 
He laughed and said he’d have to learn some patience 
first. 

“I waited in the road to die. It was cold, though there 
was so much pain that I was surprised it bothered 

171 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




me. It started to snow, and I wondered why I wasn’t 
dying. I was impatient for death to come, to end the 
pain. It was taking so long. . . . 

“Carlisle found me then. He’d smelled the blood, and 
come to investigate. I remember being vaguely 
irritated as he worked over me, trying to save my life. 
I’d never liked Dr. Cullen or his wife and her brother 
— as Edward pretended to be then. It had upset me 
that they were all more beautiful than I was, 
especially that the men were. But they didn’t mingle 
in society, so I’d only seen them once or twice. 

“I thought I’d died when he pulled me from the 
ground and ran with me — because of the speed — it 
felt like I was flying. I remembered being horrified that 
the pain didn’t stop... . 

“Then I was in a bright room, and it was warm. I was 
slipping away, and I was grateful as the pain began to 
dull. But suddenly something sharp was cutting me, 
my throat, my wrists, my ankles. I screamed in 
shock, thinking he’d brought me there to hurt me 
more. Then fire started burning through me, and I 
didn’t care about anything else. I begged him to kill 
me. When Esme and Edward returned home, I begged 
them to kill me, too. Carlisle sat with me. He held my 
hand and said that he was so sorry, promising that it 
would end. He told me everything, and sometimes I 
listened. He told me what he was, what I was 
becoming. I didn’t believe him. He apologized each 
time I screamed. 

“Edward wasn’t happy. I remember hearing them 
discuss me. I stopped screaming sometimes. It did no 
good to scream. 

“What were you thinking, Carlisle?’ Edward said. 
‘Rosalie Hale?”’ Rosalie imitated Edward’s irritated 

172 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




tone to perfection. “I didn’t like the way he said my 
name, like there was something wrong with me. 

“‘I couldn’t just let her die,’ Carlisle said quietly. ‘It 
was too much — too horrible, too much waste.’ 

“‘I know,’ Edward said, and I thought he sounded 
dismissive. It angered me. I didn’t know then that he 
really could see exactly what Carlisle had seen. 

“‘It was too much waste. I couldn’t leave her,’ Carlisle 
repeated in a whisper. 

“‘Of course you couldn’t,’ Esme agreed. 

‘“People die all the time,’ Edward reminded him in a 
hard voice. ‘Don’t you think she’s just a little 
recognizable, though? The Kings will have to put up a 
huge search — not that anyone suspects the fiend,’ 
he growled. 

“It pleased me that they seemed to know that Royce 
was guilty. 

“I didn’t realize that it was almost over — that I was 
getting stronger and that was why I was able to 
concentrate on what they were saying. The pain was 
beginning to fade from my fingertips. 

‘“What are we going to do with her?’ Edward said 
disgustedly — or that’s how it sounded to me, at 
least. 

“Carlisle sighed. That’s up to her, of course. She may 
want to go her own way. ’ 

“I’d believed enough of what he’d told me that his 
words terrified me. I knew that my life was ended, 



173 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




and there was no going back for me. I couldn’t stand 
the thought of being alone... . 



“The pain finally ended and they explained to me 
again what I was. This time I believed. I felt the thirst, 
my hard skin; I saw my brilliant red eyes. 

“Shallow as I was, I felt better when I saw my 
reflection in the mirror the first time. Despite the 
eyes, I was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.” 

She laughed at herself for a moment. “It took some 
time before I began to blame the beauty for what had 
happened to me — for me to see the curse of it. To 
wish that I had been ... well, not ugly, but normal. 

Like Vera. So I could have been allowed to marry 
someone who loved me, and have pretty babies. 

That’s what I’d really wanted, all along. It still doesn’t 
seem like too much to have asked for.” 

She was thoughtful for a moment, and I wondered if 
she’d forgotten my presence again. But then she 
smiled at me, her expression suddenly triumphant. 

“You know, my record is almost as clean as 
Carlisle’s,” she told me. “Better than Esme. A 
thousand times better than Edward. I’ve never tasted 
human blood,” she announced proudly. 

She understood my puzzled expression as I wondered 
why her record was only almost as clean. 

“I did murder five humans,” she told me in a 
complacent tone. “If you can really call them human. 
But I was very careful not to spill their blood — I 
knew I wouldn’t be able to resist that, and I didn’t 
want any part of them in me, you see. 

“I saved Royce for last. I hoped that he would hear of 
his friends’ deaths and understand, know what was 

174 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




coming for him. I hoped the fear would make the end 
worse for him. I think it worked. He was hiding inside 
a windowless room behind a door as thick as a bank 
vault’s, guarded outside by armed men, when I 
caught up with him. Oops — seven murders,” she 
corrected herself. “I forgot about his guards. They 
only took a second.” 

“I was overly theatrical. It was kind of childish, really. 

I wore a wedding dress I’d stolen for the occasion. He 
screamed when he saw me. He screamed a lot that 
night. Saving him for last was a good idea — it made 
it easier for me to control myself, to make it slower — ” 

She broke off suddenly, and she glanced down at me. 
“I’m sorry,” she said in a chagrined voice. “I’m 
frightening you, aren’t I?” 

“I’m fine,” I lied. 

“I got carried away.” 

“Don’t worry about it.” 

“I’m surprised Edward didn’t tell you more about it.” 

“He doesn’t like to tell other people’s stories — he 
feels like he’s betraying confidences, because he hears 
so much more than just the parts they mean for him 
to hear.” 

She smiled and shook her head. “I probably ought to 
give him more credit. He’s really quite decent, isn’t 
he?” 

“I think so.” 



175 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I can tell.” Then she sighed. “I haven’t been fair to 
you, either, Bella. Did he tell you why? Or was that 
too confidential?” 

“He said it was because I was human. He said it was 
harder for you to have someone on the outside who 
knew.” 

Rosalie’s musical laughter interrupted me. “Now I 
really feel guilty. He’s been much, much kinder to me 
than I deserve.” She seemed warmer as she laughed, 
like she’d let down some guard that had never been 
absent in my presence before. “What a liar that boy 
is.” She laughed again. 

“He was lying?” I asked, suddenly wary. 

“Well, that’s probably putting it too strongly. He just 
didn’t tell you the whole story. What he told you was 
true, even truer now than it was before. However, at 
the time ...” She broke off, chuckling nervously. “It’s 
embarrassing. You see, at first, I was mostly jealous 
because he wanted you and not me.” 

Her words sent a thrill of fear through me. Sitting 
there in the silver light, she was more beautiful than 
anything else I could imagine. I could not compete 
with Rosalie. 

“But you love Emmett ... ,” I mumbled. 

She shook her head back and forth, amused. “I don’t 
want Edward that way, Bella. I never did — I love him 
as a brother, but he’s irritated me from the first 
moment I heard him speak. You have to understand, 
though ... I was so used to people wanting me. And 
Edward wasn’t the least bit interested. It frustrated 
me, even offended me in the beginning. But he never 
wanted anyone, so it didn’t bother me long. Even 
176 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




when we first met Tanya’s clan in Denali — all those 
females! — Edward never showed the slightest 
preference. And then he met you.” She looked at me 
with confused eyes. I was only half paying attention. I 
was thinking about Edward and Tanya and all those 
females, and my lips pressed together in a hard line. 

“Not that you aren’t pretty, Bella,” she said, 
misreading my expression. “But it just meant that he 
found you more attractive than me. I’m vain enough 
that I minded.” 

“But you said ‘at first.’ That doesn’t still ... bother 
you, does it? I mean, we both know you’re the most 
beautiful person on the planet.” 

I laughed at having to say the words — it was so 
obvious. How odd that Rosalie should need such 
reassurances. 

Rosalie laughed, too. “Thanks, Bella. And no, it 
doesn’t really bother me anymore. Edward has always 
been a little strange.” She laughed again. 

“But you still don’t like me,” I whispered. 

Her smile faded. “I’m sorry about that.” 

We sat in silence for a moment, and she didn’t seem 
inclined to go on. 

“Would you tell me why? Did I do something ... ?” 

Was she angry that I’d put her family — her Emmett 
— in danger? Time and time again. James, and now 
Victoria ... 

“No, you haven’t done anything,” she murmured. “Not 
yet.” 



177 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I stared at her, perplexed. 



“Don’t you see, Bella?” Her voice was suddenly more 
passionate than before, even while she’d told her 
unhappy story. “You already have everything. You 
have a whole life ahead of you — everything I want. 
And you’re going to just throw it away. Can’t you see 
that I’d trade everything I have to be you? You have 
the choice that I didn’t have, and you’re choosing 
wrong!” 

I flinched back from her fierce expression. I realized 
my mouth had fallen open and I snapped it shut. 

She stared at me for a long moment and, slowly, the 
fervor in her eyes dimmed. Abruptly, she was 
abashed. 

“And I was so sure that I could do this calmly.” She 
shook her head, seeming a little dazed by the flood of 
emotion. “It’s just that it’s harder now than it was 
then, when it was no more than vanity.” 

She stared at the moon in silence. It was a few 
moments before I was brave enough to break into her 
reverie. 

“Would you like me better if I chose to stay human?” 

She turned back to me, her lips twitching into a hint 
of a smile. “Maybe.” 

“You did get some of your happy ending, though,” I 
reminded her. “You got Emmett.” 

“I got half.” She grinned. “You know that I saved 
Emmett from a bear that was mauling him, and 
carried him home to Carlisle. But can you guess why 
I stopped the bear from eating him?” 

178 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I shook my head. 



“With the dark curls ... the dimples that showed even 
while he was grimacing in pain . . . the strange 
innocence that seemed so out of place on a grown 
man’s face ... he reminded me of Vera’s little Henry. I 
didn’t want him to die — so much that, even though I 
hated this life, I was selfish enough to ask Carlisle to 
change him for me. 

“I got luckier than I deserved. Emmett is everything I 
would have asked for if I’d known myself well enough 
to know what to ask for. He’s exactly the kind of 
person someone like me needs. And, oddly enough, he 
needs me, too. That part worked out better than I 
could have hoped. But there will never be more than 
the two of us. And I’ll never sit on a porch somewhere, 
with him gray-haired by my side, surrounded by our 
grandchildren . ” 

Her smile was kind now. “That sounds quite bizarre 
to you, doesn’t it? In some ways, you are much more 
mature than I was at eighteen. But in other ways ... 
there are many things you’ve probably never thought 
about seriously. You’re too young to know what you’ll 
want in ten years, fifteen years — and too young to 
give it all up without thinking it through. You don’t 
want to be rash about permanent things, Bella.” She 
patted my head, but the gesture didn’t feel 
condescending. 

I sighed. 

“Just think about it a little. Once it’s done, it can’t be 
undone. Esme’s made do with us as substitutes ... 
and Alice doesn’t remember anything human so she 
can’t miss it... . You will remember, though. It’s a lot 
to give up.” 



179 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




But more to get in return, I didn’t say aloud. “Thanks, 
Rosalie. It’s nice to understand ... to know you 
better.” 



“I apologize for being such a monster.” She grinned. 
“I’ll try to behave myself from now on.” 

I grinned back at her. 

We weren’t friends yet, but I was pretty sure she 
wouldn’t always hate me so much. 

“I’ll let you sleep now.” Rosalie’s eyes flickered to the 
bed, and her lips twitched. “I know you’re frustrated 
that he’s keeping you locked up like this, but don’t 
give him too bad a time when he gets back. He loves 
you more than you know. It terrifies him to be away 
from you.” She got up silently and ghosted to the 
door. “Goodnight, Bella,” she whispered as she shut it 
behind herself. 

“Goodnight, Rosalie,” I murmured a second too late. 

It took me a long time to fall asleep after that. 

When I did sleep, I had a nightmare. I was crawling 
across the dark, cold stones of an unfamiliar street, 
under lightly falling snow, leaving a trail of blood 
smeared behind me. A shadowy angel in a long white 
dress watched my progress with resentful eyes. 

The next morning, Alice drove me to school while I 
stared grumpily out the windshield. I was feeling 
sleep-deprived, and it made the irritation of my 
imprisonment that much stronger. 

“Tonight we’ll go out to Olympia or something,” she 
promised. “That would be fun, right?” 



180 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Why don’t you just lock me in the basement,” I 
suggested, “and forget the sugar coating?” 

Alice frowned. “He’s going to take the Porsche back. 
I’m not doing a very good job. You’re supposed to be 
having fun.” 

“It’s not your fault,” I muttered. I couldn’t believe I 
actually felt guilty. “I’ll see you at lunch.” 

I trudged off to English. Without Edward, the day was 
guaranteed to be unbearable. I sulked through my 
first class, well aware that my attitude wasn’t helping 
anything. 

When the bell rang, I got up without much 
enthusiasm. Mike was there at the door, holding it 
open for me. 

“Edward hiking this weekend?” he asked sociably as 
we walked out into the light rain. 

“Yeah.” 

“You want to do something tonight?” 

How could he still sound hopeful? 

“Can’t. I’ve got a slumber party,” I grumbled. He gave 
me a strange look as he processed my mood. 

“Who are you — ” 

Mike’s question was cut short as a loud, growling roar 
erupted from behind us in the parking lot. Everyone 
on the sidewalk turned to look, staring in disbelief as 
the noisy black motorcycle screeched to a stop on the 
edge of the concrete, the engine still snarling. 



181 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jacob waved to me urgently. 

“Run, Bella!” he yelled over the engine’s roar. 

I was frozen for a second before I understood. 

I looked at Mike quickly. I knew I only had seconds. 

How far would Alice go to restrain me in public? 

“I got really sick and went home, okay?” I said to 
Mike, my voice filled with sudden excitement. 

“Fine,” he muttered. 

I pecked Mike swiftly on the cheek. “Thanks, Mike. I 
owe you one!” I called as I sprinted away. 

Jacob revved his engine, grinning. I jumped on the 
back of his seat, wrapping my arms tightly around his 
waist. 

I caught sight of Alice, frozen at the edge of the 
cafeteria, her eyes sparking with fury, her lip curled 
back over her teeth. 

I shot her one pleading glance. 

Then we were racing across the blacktop so fast that 
my stomach got lost somewhere behind me. 

“Hold on,” Jacob shouted. 

I hid my face in his back as he sped down the 
highway. I knew he would slow down when we hit the 
Quileute border. I just had to hold on till then. I 
prayed silently and fervently that Alice wouldn’t 
follow, and that Charlie wouldn’t happen to see me... . 



182 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




It was obvious when we had reached the safe zone. 
The bike slowed, and Jacob straightened up and 
howled with laughter. I opened my eyes. 

“We made it,” he shouted. “Not bad for a prison 
break, eh?” 

“Good thinking, Jake.” 

“I remembered what you said about the psychic leech 
not being about to predict what I’m going to do. I’m 
glad you didn’t think of this — she wouldn’t have let 
you go to school.” 

“That’s why I didn’t consider it.” 

He laughed triumphantly. “What do you want to do 
today?” 

“Anything!” I laughed back. It felt great to be free. 



183 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 





We ended up on the beach again, wandering 
aimlessly. Jacob was still full of himself for 
engineering my escape. 

“Do you think they’ll come looking for you?” he asked, 
sounding hopeful. 

“No.” I was certain about that. “They’re going to be 
furious with me tonight, though.” 

He picked up a rock and chucked it into the waves. 
“Don’t go back, then,” he suggested again. 

“Charlie would love that,” I said sarcastically. 

“I bet he wouldn’t mind.” 

I didn’t answer. Jacob was probably right, and that 
made me grind my teeth together. Charlie’s blatant 
preference for my Quileute friends was so unfair. I 
wondered if he would feel the same if he knew the 
choice was really between vampires and werewolves. 

“So what’s the latest pack scandal?” I asked lightly. 

Jacob skidded to a halt, and he stared down at me 
with shocked eyes. 

“What? That was a joke.” 

“Oh.” He looked away. 

I waited for him to start walking again, but he seemed 
lost in thought. 

184 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



“Is there a scandal?” I wondered. 



Jacob chuckled once. “I forget what it’s like, not 
having everyone know everything all the time. Having 
a quiet, private place inside my head.” 

We walked along the stony beach quietly for a few 
minutes. 

“So what is it?” I finally asked. “That everyone in your 
head already knows?” 

He hesitated for a moment, as if he weren’t sure how 
much he was going to tell me. Then he sighed and 
said, “Quil imprinted. That’s three now. The rest of us 
are starting to get worried. Maybe it’s more common 
than the stories say... .” He frowned, and then turned 
to stare at me. He gazed into my eyes without 
speaking, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration. 

“What are you staring at?” I asked, feeling self- 
conscious. 

He sighed. “Nothing.” 

Jacob started walking again. Without seeming to 
think about it, he reached out and took my hand. We 
paced silently across the rocks. 

I thought of how we must look walking hand and 
hand down the beach — like a couple, certainly — 
and wondered if I should object. But this was the way 
it had always been with Jacob... . No reason to get 
worked up about it now. 

“Why is Quil’s imprinting such a scandal?” I asked 
when it didn’t look like he was going to go on. “Is it 
because he’s the newest one?”

“That doesn’t have anything to do with it.” 



“Then what’s the problem?” 

“It’s another one of those legend things. I wonder 
when we’re going to stop being surprised that they’re 
all true?” he muttered to himself. 

“Are you going to tell me? Or do I have to guess?” 

“You’d never get it right. See, Quil hasn’t been 
hanging out with us, you know, until just recently. So 
he hadn’t been around Emily’s place much.” 

“Quil imprinted on Emily, too?” I gasped. 

“No! I told you not to guess. Emily had her two nieces 
down for a visit ... and Quil met Claire.” 

He didn’t continue. I thought about that for a 
moment. 

“Emily doesn’t want her niece with a werewolf? That’s 
a little hypocritical,” I said. 

But I could understand why she of all people might 
feel that way. I thought again of the long scars that 
marred her face and extended all the way down her 
right arm. Sam had lost control just once when he 
was standing too close to her. Once was all it took... . 
I’d seen the pain in Sam’s eyes when he looked at 
what he’d done to Emily. I could understand why 
Emily might want to protect her niece from that. 

“Would you please stop guessing? You’re way off. 
Emily doesn’t mind that part, it’s just, well, a little 
early.” 

“What do you mean early?”

Jacob appraised me with narrowed eyes. “Try not to 
be judgmental, okay?” 

I nodded cautiously. 

“Claire is two,” Jacob told me. 

Rain started to fall. I blinked furiously as the drops 
pelted my face. 

Jacob waited in silence. He wore no jacket, as usual; 
the rain left a spatter of dark spots on his black T- 
shirt, and dripped through his shaggy hair. His face 
was expressionless as he watched mine. 

“Quil ... imprinted ... with a two-year-old?” I was 
finally able to ask. 

“It happens.” Jacob shrugged. He bent to grab 
another rock and sent it flying out into the bay. “Or 
so the stories say.” 

“But she’s a baby,” I protested. 

He looked at me with dark amusement. “Quil’s not 
getting any older,” he reminded me, a bit of acid in 
his tone. “He’ll just have to be patient for a few 
decades.” 

“I ... don’t know what to say.” 

I was trying my hardest not to be critical, but, in 
truth, I was horrified. Until now, nothing about the 
werewolves had bothered me since the day I’d found 
out they weren’t committing the murders I’d 
suspected them of. 

“You’re making judgments,” he accused. “I can see it 
on your face.”

“Sorry,” I muttered. “But it sounds really creepy.” 

“It’s not like that; you’ve got it all wrong,” Jacob 
defended his friend, suddenly vehement. “I’ve seen 
what it’s like, through his eyes. There’s nothing 
romantic about it at all, not for Quil, not now.” He 
took a deep breath, frustrated. “It’s so hard to 
describe. It’s not like love at first sight, really. It’s 
more like ... gravity moves. When you see her, 
suddenly it’s not the earth holding you here anymore. 
She does. And nothing matters more than her. And 
you would do anything for her, be anything for her. . . . 
You become whatever she needs you to be, whether 
that’s a protector, or a lover, or a friend, or a brother. 

“Quil will be the best, kindest big brother any kid ever 
had. There isn’t a toddler on the planet that will be 
more carefully looked after than that little girl will be. 
And then, when she’s older and needs a friend, he’ll 
be more understanding, trustworthy, and reliable 
than anyone else she knows. And then, when she’s 
grown up, they’ll be as happy as Emily and Sam.” A 
strange, bitter edge sharpened his tone at the very 
end, when he spoke of Sam. 

“Doesn’t Claire get a choice here?” 

“Of course. But why wouldn’t she choose him, in the 
end? Hell be her perfect match. Like he was designed 
for her alone.” 

We walked in silence for a moment, till I paused to 
toss a rock toward the ocean. It fell to the beach 
several meters short. Jacob laughed at me. 

“We can’t all be freakishly strong,” I muttered. 

He sighed. 



188 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“When do you think it will happen for you?” I asked 
quietly. 

His answer was flat and immediate. “Never.” 

“It’s not something you can control, is it?” 

He was silent for a few minutes. Unconsciously, we 
both walked slower, barely moving at all. 

“It’s not supposed to be,” he admitted. “But you have 
to see her — the one that’s supposedly meant for 
you.” 

“And you think that if you haven’t seen her yet, then 
she’s not out there?” I asked skeptically. “Jacob, you 
haven’t really seen much of the world — less than me, 
even.” 

“No, I haven’t,” he said in a low voice. He looked at my 
face with suddenly piercing eyes. “But I’ll never see 
anyone else, Bella. I only see you. Even when I close 
my eyes and try to see something else. Ask Quil or 
Embry. It drives them all crazy.” 

I dropped my eyes to the rocks. 

We weren’t walking anymore. The only sound was of 
the waves beating against the shore. I couldn’t hear 
the rain over their roar. 

“Maybe I’d better go home,” I whispered. 

“No!” he protested, surprised by this conclusion. 

I looked up at him again, and his eyes were anxious 
now.

“You have the whole day off, right? The bloodsucker 
won’t be home yet.” 

I glared at him. 

“No offense intended,” he said quickly. 

“Yes, I have the whole day. But, Jake ...” 

He held up his hands. “Sorry,” he apologized. “I won’t 
be like that anymore. I’ll just be Jacob.” 

I sighed. “But if that’s what you’re thinking ...” 

“Don’t worry about me,” he insisted, smiling with 
deliberate cheer, too brightly. “I know what I’m doing. 
Just tell me if I’m upsetting you.” 

“I don’t know... .” 

“C’mon, Bella. Let’s go back to the house and get our 
bikes. You’ve got to ride a motorcycle regularly to 
keep it in tune.” 

“I really don’t think I’m allowed.” 

“By who? Charlie or the blood — or him?” 

“Both.” 

Jacob grinned my grin, and he was suddenly the 
Jacob I missed the most, sunny and warm. 

I couldn’t help grinning back. 

The rain softened, turned to mist. 

“I won’t tell anyone,” he promised. 



190 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Except every one of your friends.” 

He shook his head soberly and raised his right hand. 

“I promise not to think about it.” 

I laughed. “If I get hurt, it was because I tripped.” 

“Whatever you say.” 

We rode our motorcycles on the back roads around La 
Push until the rain made them too muddy and Jacob 
insisted that he was going to pass out if he didn’t eat 
soon. Billy greeted me easily when we got to the 
house, as if my sudden reappearance meant nothing 
more complicated than that I’d wanted to spend the 
day with my friend. After we ate the sandwiches 
Jacob made, we went out to the garage and I helped 
him clean up the bikes. I hadn’t been here in months 
— since Edward had returned — but there was no 
sense of import to it. It was just another afternoon in 
the garage. 

“This is nice,” I commented when he pulled the warm 
sodas from the grocery bag. “I’ve missed this place.” 

He smiled, looking around at the plastic sheds bolted 
together over our heads. “Yeah, I can understand 
that. All the splendor of the Taj Mahal, without the 
inconvenience and expense of traveling to India.” 

“To Washington’s little Taj Mahal,” I toasted, holding 
up my can. 

He touched his can to mine. 

“Do you remember last Valentine’s Day? I think that 
was the last time you were here — the last time when 
things were still ... normal, I mean.” 



191 | P a g e

I laughed. “Of course I remember. I traded a lifetime 
of servitude for a box of conversation hearts. That’s 
not something I’m likely to forget.” 

He laughed with me. “That’s right. Hmm, servitude. 

I’ll have to think of something good.” Then he sighed. 
“It feels like it was years ago. Another era. A happier 
one.” 

I couldn’t agree with him. This was my happy era 
now. But I was surprised to realize how many things I 
missed from my own personal dark ages. I stared 
through the opening at the murky forest. The rain 
had picked up again, but it was warm in the little 
garage, sitting next to Jacob. He was as good as a 
furnace. 

His fingers brushed my hand. “Things have really 
changed.” 

“Yeah,” I said, and then I reached out and patted the 
back tire of my bike. “Charlie used to like me. I hope 
Billy doesn’t say anything about today... .” I bit my 

lip- 

“He won’t. He doesn’t get worked up about things the 
way Charlie does. Hey, I never did apologize officially 
for that stupid move with the bike. I’m real sorry 
about ratting you out to Charlie. I wish I hadn’t.” 

I rolled my eyes. “Me, too.” 

“I’m really, really sorry.” 

He looked at me hopefully, his wet, tangled black hair 
sticking up in every direction around his pleading 
face. 

“Oh, fine! You’re forgiven.” 

192 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Thanks, Bells!” 



We grinned at each other for a second, and then his 
face clouded over. 

“You know that day, when I brought the bike over . . . 
I’ve been wanting to ask you something,” he said 
slowly. “But also ... not wanting to.” 

I held very still — a reaction to stress. It was a habit 
I’d picked up from Edward. 

“Were you just being stubborn because you were mad 
at me, or were you really serious?” he whispered. 

“About what?” I whispered back, though I was sure I 
knew what he meant. 

He glared at me. “You know. When you said it was 
none of my business ... if — if he bit you.” He cringed 
visibly at the end. 

“Jake ...” My throat felt swollen. I couldn’t finish. 

He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “Were you 
serious?” 

He was trembling just slightly. His eyes stayed closed. 
“Yes,” I whispered. 

Jacob inhaled, slow and deep. “I guess I knew that.” 

I stared at his face, waiting for his eyes to open. 

“You know what this will mean?” He demanded 
suddenly. “You do understand that, don’t you? What 
will happen if they break the treaty?” 



193 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Well leave first,” I said in a small voice. 



His eyes flashed open, their black depths full of anger 
and pain. “There wasn’t a geographic limit to the 
treaty, Bella. Our great-grandfathers only agreed to 
keep the peace because the Cullens swore that they 
were different, that humans weren’t in danger from 
them. They promised they would never kill or change 
anyone ever again. If they go back on their word, the 
treaty is meaningless, and they are no different than 
any other vampires. Once that’s established, when we 
find them again — ” 

“But, Jake, didn’t you break the treaty already?” I 
asked, grasping at straws. “Wasn’t part of it that you 
not tell people about the vampires? And you told me. 
So isn’t the treaty sort of moot, anyhow?” 

Jacob didn’t like the reminder; the pain in his eyes 
hardened into animosity. “Yeah, I broke the treaty — 
back before I believed any of it. And I’m sure they 
were informed of that.” He glared sourly at my 
forehead, not meeting my shamed gaze. “But it’s not 
like that gives them a freebie or anything. There’s no 
fault for a fault. They have only one option if they 
object to what I did. The same option we’ll have when 
they break the treaty: to attack. To start the war.” 

He made it sound so inevitable. I shuddered. 

“Jake, it doesn’t have to be that way.” 

His teeth ground together. “It is that way.” 

The silence after his declaration felt very loud. 

“Will you never forgive me, Jacob?” I whispered. As 
soon as I said the words, I wished I hadn’t. I didn’t 
want to hear his answer. 

194 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You won’t be Bella anymore,” he told me. “My friend 
won’t exist. There’ll be no one to forgive.” 

“That sounds like a no,” I whispered. 

We faced each other for an endless moment. 

“Is this goodbye then, Jake?” 

He blinked rapidly, his fierce expression melting in 
surprise. “Why? We still have a few years. Can’t we be 
friends until we’re out of time?” 

“Years? No, Jake, not years.” I shook my head, and 
laughed once without humor. “Weeks is more 
accurate.” 

I was not expecting his reaction. 

He was suddenly on his feet, and there was a loud 
pop as the soda can exploded in his hand. Soda flew 
everywhere, soaking me, like it was spraying from a 
hose. 

“Jake!” I started to complain, but I fell silent when I 
realized that his whole body was quivering with anger. 
He glared at me wildly, a growling sound building in 
his chest. 

I froze in place, too shocked to remember how to 
move. 

The shaking rolled through him, getting faster, until it 
looked like he was vibrating. His shape blurred... . 

And then Jacob gritted his teeth together, and the 
growling stopped. He squeezed his eyes tight in 
concentration; the quivering slowed until only his 
hands were shaking. 

195 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Weeks,” Jacob said in a flat monotone. 



I couldn’t respond; I was still frozen. 

He opened his eyes. They were beyond fury now. 

“He’s going to change you into a filthy bloodsucker in 
just a few weeks!” Jacob hissed through his teeth. 

Too stunned to take offense at his words, I just 
nodded mutely. 

His face turned green under the russet skin. 

“Of course, Jake,” I whispered after a long minute of 
silence. “He’s seventeen, Jacob. And I get closer to 
nineteen every day. Besides, what’s the point in 
waiting? He’s all I want. What else can I do?” 

I’d meant that as a rhetorical question. 

His words cracked like snaps of a whip. “Anything. 
Anything else. You’d be better off dead. I’d rather you 
were.” 

I recoiled like he’d slapped me. It hurt worse than if 
he had. 

And then, as the pain shot through me, my own 
temper burst into flame. 

“Maybe you’ll get lucky,” I said bleakly, lurching to my 
feet. “Maybe I’ll get hit by a truck on my way back.” 

I grabbed my motorcycle and pushed it out into the 
rain. He didn’t move as I passed him. As soon as I 
was on the small, muddy path, I climbed on and 
kicked the bike to life. The rear tire spit a fountain of 
mud toward the garage, and I hoped that it hit him. 

196 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I got absolutely soaked as I sped across the slick 
highway toward the Cullens’ house. The wind felt like 
it was freezing the rain against my skin, and my teeth 
were chattering before I was halfway there. 

Motorcycles were too impractical for Washington. I 
would sell the stupid thing first chance I got. 

I walked the bike into the Cullens’ cavernous garage 
and was unsurprised to find Alice waiting for me, 
perched lightly on the hood of her Porsche. Alice 
stroked the glossy yellow paint. 

“I haven’t even had a chance to drive it.” She sighed. 

“Sorry,” I spit through my rattling teeth. 

“You look like you could use a hot shower,” she said, 
offhand, as she sprang lightly to her feet. 

“Yep.” 

She pursed her lips, taking in my expression 
carefully. “Do you want to talk about it?” 

“Nope.” 

She nodded in assent, but her eyes were raging with 
curiosity. 

“Do you want to go to Olympia tonight?” 

“Not really. Can’t I go home?” 

She grimaced. 

“Never mind, Alice,” I said. “I’ll stay if it makes things 
easier for you.”

“Thanks,” she sighed in relief. 

I went to bed early that night, curling up on his sofa 
again. 

It was still dark when I woke. I was groggy, but I knew 
it wasn’t near morning yet. My eyes closed, and I 
stretched, rolling over. It took me a second before I 
realized that the movement should have dumped me 
onto the floor. And that I was much too comfortable. 

I rolled back over, trying to see. It was darker than 
last night — the clouds were too thick for the moon to 
shine through. 

“Sorry,” he murmured so softly that his voice was 
part of the darkness. “I didn’t mean to wake you.” 

I tensed, waiting for the fury — both his and mine — 
but it was only quiet and calm in the darkness of his 
room. I could almost taste the sweetness of reunion in 
the air, a separate fragrance from the perfume of his 
breath; the emptiness when we were apart left its own 
bitter aftertaste, something I didn’t consciously notice 
until it was removed. 

There was no friction in the space between us. The 
stillness was peaceful — not like the calm before the 
tempest, but like a clear night untouched by even the 
dream of a storm. 

And I didn’t care that I was supposed to be angry with 
him. I didn’t care that I was supposed to be angry 
with everyone. I reached out for him, found his hands 
in the darkness, and pulled myself closer to him. His 
arms encircled me, cradling me to his chest. My lips 
searched, hunting along his throat, to his chin, till I 
finally found his lips. 



198 | P a g e

Edward kissed me softly for a moment, and then he 
chuckled. 

“I was all braced for the wrath that was going to put 
grizzlies to shame, and this is what I get? I should 
infuriate you more often.” 

“Give me a minute to work up to it,” I teased, kissing 
him again. 

“I’ll wait as long as you want,” he whispered against 
my lips. His fingers knotted in my hair. 

My breath was becoming uneven. “Maybe in the 
morning.” 

“Whatever you prefer.” 

“Welcome home,” I said while his cold lips pressed 
under my jaw. “I’m glad you came back.” 

“That’s a very good thing.” 

“Mmm,” I agreed, tightening my arms around his 
neck. 

His hand curved around my elbow, moving slowly 
down my arm, across my ribs and over my waist, 
tracing along my hip and down my leg, around my 
knee. He paused there, his hand curling around my 
calf. He pulled my leg up suddenly, hitching it around 
his hip. 

I stopped breathing. This wasn’t the kind of thing he 
usually allowed. Despite his cold hands, I felt 
suddenly warm. His lips moved in the hollow at the 
base of my throat. 



199 | P a g e

“Not to bring on the ire prematurely,” he whispered, 
“but do you mind telling me what it is about this bed 
that you object to?” 

Before I could answer, before I could even concentrate 
enough to make sense of his words, he rolled to the 
side, pulling me on top of him. He held my face in his 
hands, angling it up so that his mouth could reach 
my throat. My breathing was too loud — it was almost 
embarrassing, but I couldn’t care quite enough to be 
ashamed. 

“The bed?” he asked again. “I think it’s nice.” 

“It’s unnecessary,” I managed to gasp. 

He pulled my face back to his, and my lips shaped 
themselves around his. Slowly this time, he rolled till 
he hovered over me. He held himself carefully so that 
I felt none of his weight, but I could feel the cool 
marble of his body press against mine. My heart was 
hammering so loudly that it was hard to hear his 
quiet laughter. 

“That’s debatable,” he disagreed. “This would be 
difficult on a couch.” 

Cold as ice, his tongue lightly traced the shape of my 
lips. 

My head was spinning — the air was coming too fast 
and shallow. 

“Did you change your mind?” I asked breathlessly. 
Maybe he’d rethought all his careful rules. Maybe 
there was more significance to this bed than I’d 
originally guessed. My heart pounded almost 
painfully as I waited for his answer.

Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Edward sighed, rolling back so that we were on our 
sides again. 

“Don’t be ridiculous, Bella,” he said, disapproval 
strong in his voice — clearly, he understood what I 
meant. “I was just trying to illustrate the benefits of 
the bed you don’t seem to like. Don’t get carried 
away.” 

“Too late,” I muttered. “And I like the bed,” I added. 

“Good.” I could hear the smile in his voice as he 
kissed my forehead. “I do, too.” 

“But I still think it’s unnecessary,” I continued. “If 
we’re not going to get carried away, what’s the point?” 

He sighed again. “For the hundredth time, Bella — it’s 
too dangerous.” 

“I like danger,” I insisted. 

“I know.” There was a sour edge to his voice, and I 
realized that he would have seen the motorcycle in 
the garage. 

“I’ll tell you what’s dangerous,” I said quickly, before 
he could move to a new topic of discussion. “I’m going 
to spontaneously combust one of these days — and 
you’ll have no one but yourself to blame.” 

He started to push me away. 

“What are you doing?” I objected, clinging to him. 

“Protecting you from combustion. If this too much for 
you... .” 

“I can handle it,” I insisted. 

201 | P a g e

He let me worm myself back into the circle of his 
arms. 

“I’m sorry I gave you the wrong impression,” he said. 
“I didn’t mean to make you unhappy. That wasn’t 
nice.” 

“Actually, it was very, very nice.” 

He took a deep breath. “Aren’t you tired? I should let 
you sleep.” 

“No, I’m not. I don’t mind if you want to give me the 
wrong impression again.” 

“That’s probably a bad idea. You’re not the only one 
who gets carried away.” 

“Yes, I am,” I grumbled. 

He chuckled. “You have no idea, Bella. It doesn’t help 
that you are so eager to undermine my self-control, 
either.” 

“I’m not going to apologize for that.” 

“Can I apologize?” 

“For what?” 

“You were angry with me, remember?” 

“Oh, that.” 

“I’m sorry. I was wrong. It’s much easier to have the 
proper perspective when I have you safely here.” His 
arms tightened around me. “I go a little berserk when 
I try to leave you. I don’t think I’ll go so far again. It’s 
not worth it.” 

202 | P a g e

I smiled. “Didn’t you find any mountain lions?” 

“Yes, I did, actually. Still not worth the anxiety. I’m 
sorry I had Alice hold you hostage, though. That was 
a bad idea.” 

“Yes,” I agreed. 

“I won’t do it again.” 

“Okay,” I said easily. He was already forgiven. “But 
slumber parties do have their advantages... .” I curled 
myself closer to him, pressing my lips into the 
indentation over his collarbone. “You can hold me 
hostage any time you want.” 

“Mmm,” he sighed. “I may take you up on that.” 

“So is it my turn now?” 

“Your turn?” his voice was confused. 

“To apologize.” 

“What do you have to apologize for?” 

“Aren’t you mad at me?” I asked blankly. 

“No.” 

It sounded like he really meant it. 

I felt my eyebrows pull together. “Didn’t you see Alice 
when you got home?” 

“Yes — why?” 

“Are you going to take her Porsche back?” 



203 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Of course not. It was a gift.” 

I wished I could see his expression. His voice sounded 
as if I’d insulted him. 

“Don’t you want to know what I did?” I asked, starting 
to be puzzled by his apparent lack of concern. 

I felt him shrug. “I’m always interested in everything 
you do — but you don’t have to tell me unless you 
want to.” 

“But I went to La Push.” 

“I know.” 

“And I ditched school.” 

“So did I.” 

I stared toward the sound of his voice, tracing his 
features with my fingers, trying to understand his 
mood. “Where did all this tolerance come from?” I 
demanded. 

He sighed. 

“I decided that you were right. My problem before was 
more about my ... prejudice against werewolves than 
anything else. I’m going to try to be more reasonable 
and trust your judgment. If you say it’s safe, then I’ll 
believe you.” 

“Wow.” 

“And ... most importantly ... I’m not willing to let this 
drive a wedge between us.” 



204 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I rested my head against his chest and closed my 
eyes, totally content. 

“So,” he murmured in a casual tone. “Did you make 
plans to go back to La Push again soon?” 

I didn’t answer. His question brought back the 
memory of Jacob’s words, and my throat was 
suddenly tight. 

He misread my silence and the tension in my body. 

“Just so that I can make my own plans,” he explained 
quickly. “I don’t want you to feel like you have to 
hurry back because I’m sitting around waiting for 
you.” 

“No,” I said in a voice that sounded strange to me. “I 
don’t have plans go back.” 

“Oh. You don’t have to do that for me.” 

“I don’t think I’m welcome anymore,” I whispered. 

“Did you run over someone’s cat?” he asked lightly. I 
knew he didn’t want to force the story out of me, but I 
could hear the curiosity burning behind his words. 

“No.” I took a deep breath, and then mumbled quickly 
through the explanation. “I thought Jacob would have 
realized ... I didn’t think it would surprise him.” 

Edward waited while I hesitated. 

“He wasn’t expecting ... that it was so soon.” 

“Ah,” Edward said quietly. 



205 | P a g e

“He said he’d rather see me dead.” My voice broke on 
the last word. 

Edward was too still for a moment, controlling 
whatever reaction he didn’t want me to see. 

Then he crushed me gently to his chest. “I’m so 
sorry.” 

“I thought you’d be glad,” I whispered. 

“Glad over something that’s hurt you?” he murmured 
into my hair. “I don’t think so, Bella.” 

I sighed and relaxed, fitting myself to the stone shape 
of him. But he was motionless again, tense. 

“What’s wrong?” I asked. 

“It’s nothing.” 

“You can tell me.” 

He paused for a minute. “It might make you angry.” 

“I still want to know.” 

He sighed. “I could quite literally kill him for saying 
that to you. I want to.” 

I laughed halfheartedly. “I guess it’s a good thing 
you’ve got so much self-control.” 

“I could slip.” His tone was thoughtful. 

“If you’re going to have a lapse in control, I can think 
of a better place for it.” I reached for his face, trying to 
pull myself up to kiss him. His arms held me tighter, 
restraining.

He sighed. “Must I always be the responsible one?” 



I grinned in the darkness. “No. Let me be in charge of 
responsibility for a few minutes ... or hours.” 

“Goodnight, Bella.” 

“Wait — there was something else I wanted to ask you 
about.” 

“What’s that?” 

“I was talking to Rosalie last night... .” 

His body tensed again. “Yes. She was thinking about 
that when I got in. She gave you quite a lot to 
consider, didn’t she?” 

His voice was anxious, and I realized that he thought 
I wanted to talk about the reasons Rosalie ’d given me 
for staying human. But I was interested in something 
much more pressing. 

“She told me a little bit . . . about the time your family 
lived in Denali.” 

There was a short pause; this beginning took him by 
surprise. “Yes?” 

“She mentioned something about a bunch of female 
vampires ... and you.” 

He didn’t answer, though I waited for a long moment. 

“Don’t worry,” I said, after the silence had grown 
uncomfortable. “She told me you didn’t ... show any 
preference. But I was just wondering, you know, if 
any of them had. Shown a preference for you, I 
mean.” 

207 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Again he said nothing. 

“Which one?” I asked, trying to keep my voice casual, 
and not quite managing. “Or was there more than 
one?” 

No answer. I wished I could see his face, so I could try 
to guess what this silence meant. 

“Alice will tell me,” I said. “I’ll go ask her right now.” 

His arms tightened; I was unable to squirm even an 
inch away. 

“It’s late,” he said. His voice had a little edge to it that 
was something new. Sort of nervous, maybe a little 
embarrassed. “Besides, I think Alice stepped out... .” 

“It’s bad,” I guessed. “It’s really bad, isn’t it?” I started 
to panic, my heart accelerating as I imagined the 
gorgeous immortal rival I’d never realized I had. 

“Calm down, Bella,” he said, kissing the tip of my 
nose. “You’re being absurd.” 

“Am I? Then why won’t you tell me?” 

“Because there’s nothing to tell. You’re blowing this 
wildly out of proportion.” 

“Which one?” I insisted. 

He sighed. “Tanya expressed a little interest. I let her 
know, in a very courteous, gentlemanly fashion, that I 
did not return that interest. End of story.” 

I kept my voice as even as possible. “Tell me 
something — what does Tanya look like?” 



208 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Just like the rest of us — white skin, gold eyes,” he 
answered too quickly. 

“And, of course, extraordinarily beautiful.” 

I felt him shrug. 

“I suppose, to human eyes,” he said, indifferent. “You 
know what, though?” 

“What?” My voice was petulant. 

He put his lips right to my ear; his cold breath 
tickled. “I prefer brunettes.” 

“She’s a blonde. That figures.” 

“Strawberry blonde — not at all my type.” 

I thought about that for a while, trying to concentrate 
as his lips moved slowly along my cheek, down my 
throat, and back up again. He made the circuit three 
times before I spoke. 

“I guess that’s okay, then,” I decided. 

“Hmm,” he whispered against my skin. “You’re quite 
adorable when you’re jealous. It’s surprisingly 
enjoyable.” 

I scowled into the darkness. 

“It’s late,” he said again, murmuring, almost crooning 
now, his voice smoother than silk. “Sleep, my Bella. 
Dream happy dreams. You are the only one who has 
ever touched my heart. It will always be yours. Sleep, 
my only love.”

He started to hum my lullaby, and I knew it was only 
a matter of time till I succumbed, so I closed my eyes 
and snuggled closer into his chest.

TARGET 



Alice dropped me off in the morning, in keeping with 
the slumber party charade. It wouldn’t be long until 
Edward showed up, officially returning from his 
“hiking” trip. All of the pretenses were starting to wear 
on me. I wouldn’t miss this part of being human. 

Charlie peeked through the front window when he 
heard me slam the car door. He waved to Alice, and 
then went to get the door for me. 

“Did you have fun?” Charlie asked. 

“Sure, it was great. Very ... girlie.” 

I carried my stuff in, dumped it all at the foot of the 
stairs, and wandered into the kitchen to look for a 
snack. 

“You’ve got a message,” Charlie called after me. 

On the kitchen counter, the phone message pad was 
propped up conspicuously against a saucepan. 

Jacob called, Charlie had written. 

He said he didn’t mean it, and that he’s sorry. He 
wants you to call him. Be nice and give him a break. 
He sounded upset. 

I grimaced. Charlie didn’t usually editorialize on my 
messages. 

Jacob could just go ahead and be upset. I didn’t want 
to talk to him. Last I’d heard, they weren’t big on 

211 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 



allowing phone calls from the other side. If Jacob 
preferred me dead, then maybe he should get used to 
the silence. 

My appetite evaporated. I turned an about face and 
went to put my things away. 

“Aren’t you going to call Jacob?” Charlie asked. He 
was leaning around the living room wall, watching me 
pick up. 

“No.” 

I started up the stairs. 

“That’s not very attractive behavior, Bella,” he said. 
“Forgiveness is divine.” 

“Mind your own business,” I muttered under my 
breath, much too low for him to hear. 

I knew the laundry was building up, so after I put my 
toothpaste away and threw my dirty clothes in the 
hamper, I went to strip Charlie’s bed. I left his sheets 
in a pile at the top of the stairs and went to get mine. 

I paused beside the bed, cocking my head to the side. 

Where was my pillow? I turned in a circle, scanning 
the room. No pillow. I noticed that my room looked 
oddly tidy. Hadn’t my gray sweatshirt been draped 
over the low bedpost on the footboard? And I would 
swear there had been a pair of dirty socks behind the 
rocking chair, along with the red blouse I’d tried on 
two mornings ago, but decided was too dressy for 
school, hanging over the arm... . I spun around again. 
My hamper wasn’t empty, but it wasn’t overflowing, 
the way I thought it had been. 



212 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Was Charlie doing laundry? That was out of 
character. 

“Dad, did you start the wash?” I shouted out my door. 

“Um, no,” he shouted back, sounding guilty. “Did you 
want me to?” 

“No, I got it. Were you looking for something in my 
room?” 

“No. Why?” 

“I can’t find ... a shirt... .” 

“I haven’t been in there.” 

And then I remembered that Alice had been here to 
get my pajamas. I hadn’t noticed that she’d borrowed 
my pillow, too — probably since I’d avoided the bed. It 
looked like she had cleaned while she was passing 
through. I blushed for my slovenly ways. 

But that red shirt really wasn’t dirty, so I went to save 
it from the hamper. 

I expected to find it near the top, but it wasn’t there. I 
dug through the whole pile and still couldn’t find it. I 
knew I was probably getting paranoid, but it seemed 
like something else was missing, or maybe more than 
one something. I didn’t even have half a load here. 

I ripped my sheets off and headed for the laundry 
closet, grabbing Charlie’s on the way. The washing 
machine was empty. I checked the dryer, too, half- 
expecting to find a washed load waiting for me, 
courtesy of Alice. Nothing. I frowned, mystified. 



213 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Did you find what you were looking for?” Charlie 
yelled. 

“Not yet.” 

I went back upstairs to search under my bed. Nothing 
but dust bunnies. I started to dig through my dresser. 
Maybe I’d put the red shirt away and forgotten. 

I gave up when the doorbell rang. That would be 
Edward. 

“Door,” Charlie informed me from the couch as I 
skipped past him. 

“Don’t strain yourself, Dad.” 

I pulled the door open with a big smile on my face. 

Edward’s golden eyes were wide, his nostrils flared, 
his lips pulled back over his teeth. 

“Edward?” My voice was sharp with shock as I read 
his expression. “What — ?” 

He put his finger to my lips. “Give me two seconds,” 
he whispered. “Don’t move.” 

I stood frozen on the doorstep and he ... disappeared. 
He moved so quickly that Charlie wouldn’t even have 
seen him pass. 

Before I could compose myself enough to count to 
two, he was back. He put his arm around my waist 
and pulled me swiftly toward the kitchen. His eyes 
darted around the room, and he held me against his 
body as if he were shielding me from something. I 
threw a glance toward Charlie on the couch, but he 
was studiously ignoring us. 

214 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Someone’s been here,” he murmured in my ear after 
he pulled me to the back of the kitchen. His voice was 
strained; it was difficult to hear him over the 
thumping of the washing machine. 

“I swear that no werewolves — ” I started to say. 

“Not one of them,” he interrupted me quickly, shaking 
his head. “One of us.” 

His tone made it clear that he didn’t mean a member 
of his family. 

I felt the blood empty from my face. 

“Victoria?” I choked. 

“It’s not a scent I recognize.” 

“One of the Volturi,” I guessed. 

“Probably.” 

“When?” 

“That’s why I think it must have been them — it 
wasn’t long ago, early this morning while Charlie was 
sleeping. And whoever it was didn’t touch him, so 
there must have been another purpose.” 

“Looking for me.” 

He didn’t answer. His body was frozen, a statue. 

“What are you two hissing about in here?” Charlie 
asked suspiciously, rounding the corner with an 
empty popcorn bowl in his hands. 



215 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I felt green. A vampire had been in the house looking 
for me while Charlie slept. Panic overwhelmed me, 
closed my throat. I couldn’t answer, I just stared at 
him in horror. 

Charlie’s expression changed. Abruptly, he was 
grinning. “If you two are having a fight ... well, don’t 
let me interrupt.” 

Still grinning, he put his bowl in the sink and 
sauntered out of the room. 

“Let’s go,” Edward said in a low hard voice. 

“But Charlie!” The fear was squeezing my chest, 
making it hard to breathe. 

He deliberated for a short second, and then his phone 
was in his hand. 

“Emmett,” he muttered into the receiver. He began 
talking so fast that I couldn’t understand the words. 

It was over in half a minute. He started pulling me 
toward the door. 

“Emmett and Jasper are on their way,” he whispered 
when he felt my resistance. “They’ll sweep the woods. 
Charlie is fine.” 

I let him drag me along then, too panicked to think 
clearly. Charlie met my frightened eyes with a smug 
grin, which suddenly turned to confusion. Edward 
had me out the door before Charlie could say 
anything. 

“Where are we going?” I couldn’t stop whispering, 
even after we were in the car. 



216 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“We’re going to talk to Alice,” he told me, his volume 
normal but his voice bleak. 



“You think maybe she saw something?” 

He stared at the road through narrowed eyes. 

“Maybe.” 

They were waiting for us, on alert after Edward’s call. 
It was like walking into a museum, everyone still as 
statues in various poses of stress. 

“What happened?” Edward demanded as soon as we 
were through the door. I was shocked to see that he 
was glowering at Alice, his hands fisted in anger. 

Alice stood with her arms folded tight across her 
chest. Only her lips moved. “I have no idea. I didn’t 
see anything.” 

“How is that possible?” he hissed. 

“Edward,” I said, a quiet reproof. I didn’t like him 
talking to Alice this way. 

Carlisle interrupted in a calming voice. “It’s not an 
exact science, Edward.” 

“He was in her room, Alice. He could have still been 
there — waiting for her.” 

“I would have seen that.” 

Edward threw his hands up in exasperation. “Really? 
You’re sure?” 

Alice’s voice was cold when she answered. “You’ve 
already got me watching the Volturis’ decisions, 
watching for Victoria’s return, watching Bella’s every 

217 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




step. You want to add another? Do I just have to 
watch Charlie, or Bella’s room, or the house, or the 
whole street, too? Edward, if I try to do too much, 
things are going to start slipping through the cracks.” 

“It looks like they already are,” Edward snapped. 

“She was never in any danger. There was nothing to 
see.” 

“If you’re watching Italy, why didn’t you see them 
send — ” 

“I don’t think it’s them,” Alice insisted. “I would have 
seen that.” 

“Who else would leave Charlie alive?” 

I shuddered. 

“I don’t know,” Alice said. 

“Helpful.” 

“Stop it, Edward,” I whispered. 

He turned on me, his face still livid, his teeth 
clenched together. He glared at me for half a second, 
and then, suddenly, he exhaled. His eyes widened 
and his jaw relaxed. 

“You’re right, Bella. I’m sorry.” He looked at Alice. 
“Forgive me, Alice. I shouldn’t be taking this out on 
you. That was inexcusable.” 

“I understand,” Alice assured him. “I’m not happy 
about it, either.” 



218 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Edward took a deep breath. “Okay, let’s look at this 
logically. What are the possibilities?” 

Everyone seemed to thaw out at once. Alice relaxed 
and leaned against the back of the couch. Carlisle 
walked slowly toward her, his eyes far away. Esme sat 
on the sofa in front of Alice, curling her legs up on the 
seat. Only Rosalie remained unmoving, her back to 
us, staring out the glass wall. 

Edward pulled me to the sofa and I sat next to Esme, 
who shifted to put her arm around me. He held one of 
my hands tightly in both of his. 

“Victoria?” Carlisle asked. 

Edward shook his head. “No. I didn’t know the scent. 
He might have been from the Volturi, someone I’ve 
never met... .” 

Alice shook her head. “Aro hasn’t asked anyone to 
look for her yet. I will see that. I’m waiting for it.” 

Edward’s head snapped up. “You’re watching for an 
official command.” 

“You think someone’s acting on their own? Why?” 

“Caius’s idea,” Edward suggested, his face tightening 
again. 

“Or Jane’s ... ,” Alice said. “They both have the 
resources to send an unfamiliar face... .” 

Edward scowled. “And the motivation.” 

“It doesn’t make sense, though,” Esme said. “If 
whoever it was meant to wait for Bella, Alice would 



219 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




have seen that. He — or she — had no intention of 
hurting Bella. Or Charlie, for that matter.” 

I cringed at my father’s name. 

“It’s going to be fine, Bella,” Esme murmured, 
smoothing my hair. 

“But what was the point then?” Carlisle mused. 
“Checking to see if I’m still human?” I guessed. 
“Possible,” Carlisle said. 

Rosalie breathed out a sigh, loud enough for me to 
hear. She’d unfrozen, and her face was turned 
expectantly toward the kitchen. Edward, on the other 
hand, looked discouraged. 

Emmett burst through the kitchen door, Jasper right 
behind him. 

“Long gone, hours ago,” Emmett announced, 
disappointed. “The trail went East, then South, and 
disappeared on a side road. Had a car waiting.” 

“That’s bad luck,” Edward muttered. “If he’d gone 
west ... well, it would be nice for those dogs to make 
themselves useful.” 

I winced, and Esme rubbed my shoulder. 

Jasper looked at Carlisle. “Neither of us recognized 
him. But here.” He held out something green and 
crumpled. Carlisle took it from him and held it to his 
face. I saw, as it exchanged hands, that it was a 
broken fern frond. “Maybe you know the scent.” 



220 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“No,” Carlisle said. “Not familiar. No one I’ve ever 
met.” 

“Perhaps we’re looking at this the wrong way. Maybe 
it’s a coincidence ... Esme began, but stopped when 
she saw everyone else’s incredulous expressions. “I 
don’t mean a coincidence that a stranger happened to 
pick Bella’s house to visit at random. I meant that 
maybe someone was just curious. Our scent is all 
around her. Was he wondering what draws us there?” 

“Why wouldn’t he just come here then? If he was 
curious?” Emmett demanded. 

“You would,” Esme said with a sudden, fond smile. 
“The rest of us aren’t always so direct. Our family is 
very large — he or she might be frightened. But 
Charlie wasn’t harmed. This doesn’t have to be an 
enemy.” 

Just curious. Like James and Victoria had been 
curious, in the beginning? The thought of Victoria 
made me tremble, though the one thing they seemed 
certain of was that it had not been her. Not this time. 
She would stick to her obsessed pattern. This was 
just someone else, a stranger. 

I was slowly realizing that vampires were much bigger 
participants in this world than I’d once thought. How 
many times did the average human cross paths with 
them, completely unaware? How many deaths, 
obliviously reported as crimes and accidents, were 
really due to their thirst? How crowded would this 
new world be when I finally joined it? 

The shrouded future sent a shiver down my spine. 



221 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




The Cullens pondered Esme’s words with varying 
expressions. I could see that Edward did not accept 
her theory, and that Carlisle very much wanted to. 

Alice pursed her lips. “I don’t think so. The timing of 
it was too perfect... . This visitor was so careful to 
make no contact. Almost like he or she knew that I 
would see... .” 

“He could have other reasons for not making contact,” 
Esme reminded her. 

“Does it really matter who it was?” I asked. “Just the 
chance that someone was looking for me ... isn’t that 
reason enough? We shouldn’t wait for graduation.” 

“No, Bella,” Edward said quickly. “It’s not that bad. If 
you’re really in danger, we’ll know.” 

“Think of Charlie,” Carlisle reminded me. “Think of 
how it would hurt him if you disappeared.” 

“I am thinking of Charlie! He’s the one I’m worried 
about! What if my little guest had happened to be 
thirsty last night? As long as I’m around Charlie, he’s 
a target, too. If anything happened to him, it would be 
all my fault!” 

“Hardly, Bella,” Esme said, patting my hair again. 
“And nothing will happen to Charlie. We’re just going 
to have to be more careful.” 

“More careful?” I repeated in disbelief. 

“It’s all going to be fine, Bella,” Alice promised; 

Edward squeezed my hand. 



222 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




And I could see, looking at all of their beautiful faces 
one by one, that nothing I could say was going to 
change their minds. 

It was a quiet ride home. I was frustrated. Against my 
better judgment, I was still human. 

“You won’t be alone for a second,” Edward promised 
as he drove me to Charlie’s. “Someone will always be 
there. Emmett, Alice, Jasper ...” 

I sighed. “This is ridiculous. They’ll get so bored, 
they’ll have to kill me themselves, just for something 
to do.” 

Edward gave me a sour look. “Hilarious, Bella.” 

Charlie was in a good mood when we got back. He 
could see the tension between me and Edward, and 
he was misinterpreting it. He watched me throw 
together his dinner with a smug smile on his face. 
Edward had excused himself for a moment, to do 
some surveillance, I assumed, but Charlie waited till 
he was back to pass on my messages. 

“Jacob called again,” Charlie said as soon as Edward 
was in the room. I kept my face empty as I set the 
plate in front of him. 

“Is that a fact?” 

Charlie frowned. “Don’t be petty, Bella. He sounded 
really low.” 

“Is Jacob paying you for all the P.R., or are you a 
volunteer?” 

Charlie grumbled incoherently at me until the food 
cut off his garbled complaint. 

223 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Though he didn’t realize it, he’d found his mark. 

My life was feeling a lot like a game of dice right now 
— would the next roll come up snake eyes? What if 
something did happen to me? It seemed worse than 
petty to leave Jacob feeling guilty about what he’d 
said. 

But I didn’t want to talk to him with Charlie around, 
to have to watch my every word so I didn’t let the 
wrong thing slip. Thinking about this made me 
jealous of Jacob and Billy’s relationship. How easy it 
must be when you had no secrets from the person 
you lived with. 

So I would wait for the morning. I most likely wasn’t 
going to die tonight, after all, and it wouldn’t hurt him 
to feel guilty for twelve more hours. It might even be 
good for him. 

When Edward officially left for the evening, I 
wondered who was out in the downpour, keeping an 
eye on Charlie and me. I felt awful for Alice or 
whoever else it might be, but still comforted. I had to 
admit it was nice, knowing I wasn’t alone. And 
Edward was back in record time. 

He sang me to sleep again and — aware even in 
unconsciousness that he was there — I slept free of 
nightmares. 

In the morning, Charlie left to go fishing with Deputy 
Mark before I was up. I decided to use this lack of 
supervision to be divine. 

“I’m going to let Jacob off the hook,” I warned Edward 
after I’d eaten breakfast. 



224 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I knew you’d forgive him,” he said with an easy 
smile. “Holding grudges is not one of your many 
talents.” 

I rolled my eyes, but I was pleased. It seemed like 
Edward really was over the whole anti-werewolf thing. 

I didn’t look at the clock until after I’d dialed. It was a 
little early for calls, and I worried that I would wake 
Billy and Jake, but someone picked up before the 
second ring, so he couldn’t have been too far from the 
phone. 

“Hello?” a dull voice said. 

“Jacob?” 

“Bella!” he exclaimed. “Oh, Bella, I’m so sorry!” he 
tripped over the words as he hurried to get them out. 
“I swear I didn’t mean it. I was just being stupid. I 
was angry — but that’s no excuse. It was the 
stupidest thing I’ve ever said in my life and I’m sorry. 
Don’t be mad at me, please? Please. Lifetime of 
servitude up for grabs — all you have to do is forgive 
me.” 

“I’m not mad. You’re forgiven.” 

“Thank you,” he breathed fervently. “I can’t believe I 
was such a jerk.” 

“Don’t worry about that — I’m used to it.” 

He laughed, exuberant with relief. “Come down to see 
me,” he begged. “I want to make it up to you.” 

I frowned. “How?” 



225 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Anything you want. Cliff diving,” he suggested, 
laughing again. 

“Oh, there’s a brilliant idea.” 

“I’ll keep you safe,” he promised. “No matter what you 
want to do.” 

I glanced at Edward. His face was very calm, but I 
was sure this was not the time. 

“Not right now.” 

“He’s not thrilled with me, is he?” Jacob’s voice was 
ashamed, rather than bitter, for once. 

“That’s not the problem. There’s ... well, there’s this 
other problem that’s slightly more worrisome than a 
bratty teenage werewolf... .” I tried to keep my tone 
joking, but I didn’t fool him. 

“What’s wrong?” he demanded. 

“Um.” I wasn’t sure what I should tell him. 

Edward held his hand out for the phone. I looked at 
his face carefully. He seemed calm enough. 

“Bella?” Jacob asked. 

Edward sighed, holding his hand closer. 

“Do you mind speaking to Edward?” I asked 
apprehensively. “He wants to talk to you.” 

There was a long pause. 

“Okay,” Jacob finally agreed. “This should be 
interesting.” 

226 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I handed the phone to Edward; I hoped he could read 
the warning in my eyes. 

“Hello, Jacob,” Edward said, perfectly polite. 

There was a silence. I bit my lip, trying to guess how 
Jacob would answer. 

“Someone was here — not a scent I know,” Edward 
explained. “Has your pack come across anything 
new?” 

Another pause, while Edward nodded to himself, 
unsurprised. 

“Here’s the crux, Jacob. I won’t be letting Bella out of 
my sight till I get this taken care of. It’s nothing 
personal — ” 

Jacob interrupted him then, and I could hear the 
buzz of his voice from the receiver. Whatever he was 
saying, he was more intense than before. I tried 
unsuccessfully to make out the words. 

“You might be right — ,” Edward began, but Jacob 
was arguing again. Neither of them sounded angry, at 
least. 

“That’s an interesting suggestion. We’re quite willing 
to renegotiate. If Sam is amenable.” 

Jacob’s voice was quieter now. I started chewing on 
my thumbnail as I tried to read Edward’s expression. 

“Thank you,” Edward replied. 

Then Jacob said something that caused a surprised 
expression to flicker across Edward’s face. 



227 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I’d planned to go alone, actually,” Edward said, 
answering the unexpected question. “And leave her 
with the others.” 

Jacob’s voice rose in pitch, and it sounded to me like 
he was trying to be persuasive. 

“I’ll try to consider it objectively,” Edward promised. 
“As objectively as I’m capable of.” 

The pause was shorter this time. 

“That’s not a half-bad idea. When? ... No, that’s fine. 
I’d like a chance to follow the trail personally, anyway. 
Ten minutes ... Certainly,” Edward said. He held the 
phone out to me. “Bella?” 

I took it slowly, feeling confused. 

“What was that all about?” I asked Jacob, my voice 
peeved. I knew it was juvenile, but I felt excluded. 

“A truce, I think. Hey, do me a favor,” Jacob 
suggested. “Try to convince your bloodsucker that the 
safest place for you to be — especially when he leaves 
— is on the reservation. We’re well able to handle 
anything.” 

“Is that what you were trying to sell him?” 

“Yes. It makes sense. Charlie’s probably better off 
here, too. As much as possible.” 

“Get Billy on it,” I agreed. I hated that I was putting 
Charlie within the range of the crosshairs that always 
seemed to be centered on me. “What else?” 

“Just rearranging some boundaries, so we can catch 
anyone who gets too near Forks. I’m not sure if Sam

will go for it, but until he comes around, I’ll keep an 
eye on things.” 

“What do you mean by ‘keep an eye on things’?” 

“I mean that if you see a wolf running around your 
house, don’t shoot at it.” 

“Of course not. You really shouldn’t do anything ... 
risky, though.” 

He snorted. “Don’t be stupid. I can take care of 
myself.” 

I sighed. 

“I also tried to convince him to let you visit. He’s 
prejudiced, so don’t let him give you any crap about 
safety. He knows as well as I do that you’d be safe 
here.” 

“I’ll keep that in mind.” 

“See you in a few,” Jacob said. 

“You’re coming up?” 

“Yeah. I’m going to get the scent of your visitor so we 
can track him if he comes back.” 

“Jake, I really don’t like the idea of you tracking — ” 

“Oh please, Bella,” he interrupted. Jacob laughed, 
and then hung up.

SCENT 



to 



It was all very childish. Why on Earth should Edward 
have to leave for Jacob to come over? Weren’t we past 
this kind of immaturity? 

“It’s not that I feel any personal antagonism toward 
him, Bella, it’s just easier for both of us,” Edward told 
me at the door. “I won’t be far away. You’ll be safe.” 

“I’m not worried about that.” 

He smiled, and then a sly look came into his eye. He 
pulled me close, burying his face in my hair. I could 
feel his cool breath saturate the strands as he 
exhaled; it raised goose bumps on my neck. 

“I’ll be right back,” he said, and then he laughed 
aloud as if I’d just told a good joke. 

“What’s so funny?” 

But Edward just grinned and loped off toward the 
trees without answering. 

Grumbling to myself, I went to clean up the kitchen. 
Before I even had the sink full of water, the doorbell 
rang. It was hard to get used to how much faster 
Jacob was without his car. How everyone seemed to 
be so much faster than me... . 

“Come in, Jake!” I shouted. 

I was concentrating on piling the dishes into the 
bubbly water, and I’d forgotten that Jacob moved like 



230 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



a ghost these days. So it made me jump when his 
voice was suddenly there behind me. 

“Should you really leave your door unlocked like that? 
Oh, sorry.” 

I’d slopped myself with the dishwater when he’d 
startled me. 

“I’m not worried about anyone who would be deterred 
by a locked door,” I said while I wiped the front of my 
shirt with a dishtowel. 

“Good point,” he agreed. 

I turned to look at him, eyeing him critically. “Is it 
really so impossible to wear clothes, Jacob?” I asked. 
Once again, Jacob was bare-chested, wearing nothing 
but a pair of old cut-off jeans. Secretly, I wondered if 
he was just so proud of his new muscles that he 
couldn’t stand to cover them up. I had to admit, they 
were impressive — but I’d never thought of him as 
vain. “I mean, I know you don’t get cold anymore, but 
still.” 

He ran a hand through his wet hair; it was falling in 
his eyes. 

“It’s just easier,” he explained. 

“What’s easier?” 

He smiled condescendingly. “It’s enough of a pain to 
carry the shorts around with me, let alone a complete 
outfit. What do I look like, a pack mule?” 

I frowned. “What are you talking about, Jacob?” 



231 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




His expression was superior, like I was missing 
something obvious. “My clothes don’t just pop in and 
out of existence when I change — I have to carry them 
with me while I run. Pardon me for keeping my 
burden light.” 

I changed color. “I guess I didn’t think about that,” I 
muttered. 

He laughed and pointed to a black leather cord, thin 
as a strand of yarn, that was wound three times 
below his left calf like an anklet. I hadn’t noticed 
before that his feet were bare, too. “That’s more than 
just a fashion statement — it sucks to carry jeans in 
your mouth.” 

I didn’t know what to say to that. 

He grinned. “Does my being half-naked bother you?” 
“No.” 

Jacob laughed again, and I turned my back on him to 
focus on the dishes. I hoped he realized my blush was 
left over from embarrassment at my own stupidity, 
and had nothing to do with his question. 

“Well, I suppose I should get to work.” He sighed. “I 
wouldn’t want to give him an excuse to say I’m 
slacking on my side.” 

“Jacob, it’s not your job — ” 

He raised a hand to cut me off. “I’m working on a 
volunteer basis here. Now, where is the intruder’s 
scent the worst?” 

“My bedroom, I think.” 



232 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




His eyes narrowed. He didn’t like that any more than 
Edward had. 

“I’ll just be a minute.” 

I methodically scrubbed the plate I was holding. The 
only sound was the brush’s plastic bristles scraping 
round and round on the ceramic. I listened for 
something from above, a creak of the floorboard, the 
click of a door. There was nothing. I realized I’d been 
cleaning the same plate far longer than necessary, 
and I tried to pay attention to what I was doing. 

“Whew!” Jacob said, inches behind me, scaring me 
again. 

“Yeesh, Jake, cut that out!” 

“Sorry. Here — ” Jacob took the towel and mopped up 
my new spill. “I’ll make it up to you. You wash, I’ll 
rinse and dry.” 

“Fine.” I gave him the plate. 

“Well, the scent was easy enough to catch. By the 
way, your room reeks.” 

“I’ll buy some air freshener.” 

He laughed. 

I washed and he dried in companionable silence for a 
few minutes. 

“Can I ask you something?” 

I handed him another plate. “That depends on what 
you want to know.” 



233 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




‘Tm not trying to be a jerk or anything — I’m honestly 
curious,” Jacob assured me. 

“Fine. Go ahead.” 

He paused for half a second. “What’s it like — having 
a vampire for a boyfriend?” 

I rolled my eyes. “It’s the best.” 

“I’m serious. The idea doesn’t bother you — it never 
creeps you out?” 

“Never.” 

He was silent as he reached for the bowl in my hands. 
I peeked up at his face — he was frowning, his lower 
lip jutting out. 

“Anything else?” I asked. 

He wrinkled his nose again. “Well ... I was wondering 
... do you . . . y ’know, kiss him?” 

I laughed. “Yes.” 

He shuddered. “Ugh.” 

“To each her own,” I murmured. 

“You don’t worry about the fangs?” 

I smacked his arm, splashing him with dishwater. 
“Shut up, Jacob! You know he doesn’t have fangs!” 

“Close enough,” he muttered. 

I gritted my teeth and scrubbed a boning knife with 
more force than necessary. 

234 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Can I ask another one?” he asked softly when I 
passed the knife to him. “Just curious, again.” 



“Fine,” I snapped. 

He turned the knife over and over in his hands under 
the stream of water. When he spoke, it was only a 
whisper. “You said a few weeks... . When, exactly ... ?” 
He couldn’t finish. 

“Graduation,” I whispered back, watching his face 
warily. Would this set him off again? 

“So soon,” he breathed, his eyes closing. It didn’t 
sound like a question. It sounded like a lament. The 
muscles in his arms tightened and his shoulders were 
stiff. 

“OW!” he shouted; it had gotten so still in the room 
that I jumped a foot in the air at his outburst. 

His right hand had curled into a tense fist around the 
blade of the knife — he unclenched his hand and the 
knife clattered onto the counter. Across his palm was 
a long, deep gash. The blood streamed down his 
fingers and dripped on the floor. 

“Damn it! Ouch!” he complained. 

My head spun and my stomach rolled. I clung to the 
countertop with one hand, took a deep breath 
through my mouth, and forced myself to get a grip so 
that I could take care of him. 

“Oh, no, Jacob! Oh, crap! Here, wrap this around it!” I 
shoved the dish towel at him, reaching for his hand. 
He shrugged away from me. 

“It’s nothing, Bella, don’t worry about it.” 

235 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




The room started to shimmer a little around the 
edges. 

I took another deep breath. “Don’t worry?! You sliced 
your hand open!” 

He ignored the dish towel I pushed at him. He put his 
hand under the faucet and let the water wash over 
the wound. The water ran red. My head whirled. 

“Bella,” he said. 

I looked away from the wound, up to his face. He was 
frowning, but his expression was calm. 

“What?” 

“You look like you’re going to pass out, and you’re 
biting your lip off. Stop it. Relax. Breathe. I’m fine.” 

I inhaled through my mouth and removed my teeth 
from my lower lip. “Don’t be brave.” 

He rolled his eyes. 

“Let’s go. I’ll drive you to the ER.” I was pretty sure I 
would be okay to drive. The walls were holding steady 
now, at least. 

“Not necessary.” Jake turned off the water and took 
the towel from my hand. He twisted it loosely around 
his palm. 

“Wait,” I protested. “Let me look at it.” I clutched the 
counter more firmly, to hold myself upright if the 
wound made me woozy again. 

“Do you have a medical degree that you never told me 
about?” 

236 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Just give me the chance to decide whether or not I’m 
going to throw a fit over taking you to the hospital.” 

He made a face of mock horror. “Please, not a fit!” 

“If you don’t let me see your hand, a fit is 
guaranteed.” 

He inhaled deeply, and then let out a gusty sigh. 
“Fine.” 

He unwound the towel and, when I reached out to 
take the cloth, he laid his hand in mine. 

It took me a few seconds. I even flipped his hand over, 
though I was sure he’d cut his palm. I turned his 
hand back up, finally realizing that the angry pink, 
puckered line was all that was left of his wound. 

“But ... you were bleeding ... so much.” 

He pulled his hand back, his eyes steady and somber 
on mine. 

“I heal fast.” 

“I’ll say,” I mouthed. 

I’d seen the long gash clearly, seen the blood that 
flowed into the sink. The rust-and-salt smell of it had 
almost pulled me under. It should have needed 
stitches. It should have taken days to scab over and 
then weeks to fade into the shiny pink scar that 
marked his skin now. 

He screwed his mouth up into half a smile and 
thumped his fist once against his chest. “Werewolf, 
remember?” 



237 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




His eyes held mine for an immeasurable moment. 
“Right,” I finally said. 

He laughed at my expression. “I told you this. You 
saw Paul’s scar.” 

I shook my head to clear it. “It’s a little different, 
seeing the action sequence firsthand.” 

I kneeled down and dug the bleach out of the cabinet 
under the sink. Then I poured some on a dusting rag 
and started scrubbing the floor. The burning scent of 
the bleach cleared the last of the dizziness from my 
head. 

“Let me clean up,” Jacob said. 

“I got this. Throw that towel in the wash, will you?” 

When I was sure the floor smelled of nothing but 
bleach, I got up and rinsed the right side of the sink 
with bleach, too. Then I went to the laundry closet 
beside the pantry, and poured a cupful into the 
washing machine before starting it. Jacob watched 
me with a disapproving look on his face. 

“Do you have obsessive-compulsive disorder?” he 
asked when I was done. 

Huh. Maybe. But at least I had a good excuse this 
time. “We’re a bit sensitive to blood around here. I’m 
sure you can understand that.” 

“Oh.” He wrinkled his nose again. 

“Why not make it as easy as possible for him? What 
he’s doing is hard enough.” 



238 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Sure, sure. Why not?” 



I pulled the plug, and let the dirty water drain from 
the sink. 

“Can I ask you something, Bella?” 

I sighed. 

“What’s it like — having a werewolf for a best friend?” 

The question caught me off guard. I laughed out loud. 

“Does it creep you out?” he pressed before I could 
answer. 

“No. When the werewolf is being nice,” I qualified, “it’s 
the best.” 

He grinned widely, his teeth bright against his russet 
skin. “Thanks, Bella,” he said, and then he grabbed 
my hand and wrenched me into one of his bone- 
crushing hugs. 

Before I had time to react, he dropped his arms and 
stepped away. 

“Ugh,” he said, his nose wrinkling. “Your hair stinks 
worse than your room.” 

“Sorry,” I muttered. I suddenly understood what 
Edward had been laughing about earlier, after 
breathing on me. 

“One of the many hazards of socializing with 
vampires,” Jacob said, shrugging. “It makes you smell 
bad. A minor hazard, comparatively.” 

I glared at him. “I only smell bad to you, Jake.” 

239 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He grinned. “See you around, Bells.” 

“Are you leaving?” 

“He’s waiting for me to go. I can hear him outside.” 
“Oh.” 

“I’ll go out the back,” he said, and then he paused. 
“Hold up a sec — hey, do you think you can come to 
La Push tonight? We’re having a bonfire party. Emily 
will be there, and you could meet Kim ... And I know 
Quil wants to see you, too. He’s pretty peeved that 
you found out before he did.” 

I grinned at that. I could just imagine how that would 
have irked Quil — Jacob’s little human gal pal down 
with the werewolves while he was still clueless. And 
then I sighed. “Yeah, Jake, I don’t know about that. 
See, it’s a little tense right now... .” 

“C’mon, you think somebody’s going to get past all — 
all six of us?” 

There was a strange pause as he stuttered over the 
end of his question. I wondered if he had trouble 
saying the word werewolf aloud, the way I often had 
difficulty with vampire. 

His big dark eyes were full of unashamed pleading. 
“I’ll ask,” I said doubtfully. 

He made a noise in the back of his throat. “Is he your 
warden, now, too? You know, I saw this story on the 
news last week about controlling, abusive teenage 
relationships and — ” 



240 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Okay!” I cut him off, and then shoved his arm. “Time 
for the werewolf to get out!” 

He grinned. “Bye, Bells. Be sure you ask permission.” 

He ducked out the back door before I could find 
something to throw at him. I growled incoherently at 
the empty room. 

Seconds after he was gone, Edward walked slowly 
into the kitchen, raindrops glistening like diamonds 
set into the bronze of his hair. His eyes were wary. 

“Did you two get into a fight?” he asked. 

“Edward!” I sang, throwing myself at him. 

“Hi, there.” He laughed and wrapped his arms around 
me. “Are you trying to distract me? It’s working.” 

“No, I didn’t fight with Jacob. Much. Why?” 

“I was just wondering why you stabbed him. Not that 
I object.” With his chin, he gestured to the knife on 
the counter. 

“Dang! I thought I got everything.” 

I pulled away from him and ran to put the knife in the 
sink before I doused it with bleach. 

“I didn’t stab him,” I explained as I worked. “He forgot 
he had a knife in his hand.” 

Edward chuckled. “That’s not nearly as fun as the 
way I imagined it.” 

“Be nice.” 



241 | P a g e

He took a big envelope from his jacket pocket and 
tossed it on the counter. “I got your mail.” 



“Anything good?” 

“I think so.” 

My eyes narrowed suspiciously at his tone. I went to 
investigate. 

He’d folded the legal-sized envelope in half. I 
smoothed it open, surprised at the weight of the 
expensive paper, and read the return address. 

“Dartmouth? Is this a joke?” 

“I’m sure it’s an acceptance. It looks exactly like 
mine.” 

“Good grief, Edward — what did you do?” 

“I sent in your application, that’s all.” 

“I may not be Dartmouth material, but I’m not stupid 
enough to believe that.” 

“Dartmouth seems to think that you’re Dartmouth 
material.” 

I took a deep breath and counted slowly to ten. 

“That’s very generous of them,” I finally said. 

“However, accepted or not, there is still the minor 
matter of tuition. I can’t afford it, and I’m not letting 
you throw away enough money to buy yourself 
another sports car just so that I can pretend to go to 
Dartmouth next year.” 

“I don’t need another sports car. And you don’t have 
to pretend anything,” he murmured. “One year of 

242 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




college wouldn’t kill you. Maybe you’d even like it. 

Just think about it, Bella. Imagine how excited 
Charlie and Renee would be... .” 

His velvet voice painted the picture in my head before 
I could block it. Of course Charlie would explode with 
pride — no one in the town of Forks would be able to 
escape the fallout from his excitement. And Renee 
would be hysterical with joy at my triumph — though 
she’d swear she wasn’t at all surprised... . 

I tried to shake the image out of my head. “Edward. 
I’m worried about living through graduation, let alone 
this summer or next fall.” 

His arms wrapped around me again. “No one is going 
to hurt you. You have all the time in the world.” 

I sighed. “I’m mailing the contents of my bank 
account to Alaska tomorrow. It’s all the alibi I need. 
It’s far enough away that Charlie won’t expect a visit 
until Christmas at the earliest. And I’m sure I’ll think 
of some excuse by then. You know,” I teased 
halfheartedly, “this whole secrecy and deception thing 
is kind of a pain.” 

Edward’s expression hardened. “It gets easier. After a 
few decades, everyone you know is dead. Problem 
solved.” 

I flinched. 

“Sorry, that was harsh.” 

I stared down at the big white envelope, not seeing it. 
“But still true.” 

“If I get this resolved, whatever it is we’re dealing with, 
will you please consider waiting?” 

243 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Nope.” 



“Always so stubborn.” 

“Yep.” 

The washing machine thumped and stuttered to a 
halt. 

“Stupid piece of junk,” I muttered as I pulled away 
from him. I moved the one small towel that had 
unbalanced the otherwise empty machine, and 
started it again. 

“This reminds me,” I said. “Could you ask Alice what 
she did with my stuff when she cleaned my room? I 
can’t find it anywhere.” 

He looked at me with confused eyes. “Alice cleaned 
your room?” 

“Yeah, I guess that’s what she was doing. When she 
came to get my pajamas and pillow and stuff to hold 
me hostage.” I glowered at him briefly. “She picked up 
everything that was lying around, my shirts, my 
socks, and I don’t know where she put them.” 

Edward continued to look confused for one short 
moment, and then, abruptly, he was rigid. 

“When did you notice your things were missing?” 

“When I got back from the fake slumber party. Why?” 

“I don’t think Alice took anything. Not your clothes, or 
your pillow. The things that were taken, these were 
things you’d worn ... and touched ... and slept on?” 

“Yes. What is it, Edward?” 

244 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




His expression was strained. “Things with your 
scent.” 

“Oh!” 

We stared into each others eyes for a long moment. 
“My visitor,” I muttered. 

“He was gathering traces ... evidence. To prove that 
he’d found you?” 

“Why?” I whispered. 

“I don’t know. But, Bella, I swear I will find out. I 
will.” 

“I know you will,” I said, laying my head against his 
chest. Leaning there, I felt his phone vibrate in his 
pocket. 

He pulled out his phone and glanced at the number. 
“Just the person I need to talk to,” he murmured, and 
then he flipped it open. “Carlisle, I — ” He broke off 
and listened, his face taut with concentration for a 
few minutes. “I’ll check it out. Listen ...” 

He explained about my missing things, but from the 
side I was hearing, it sounded like Carlisle had no 
insights for us. 

“Maybe I’ll go ... ,” Edward said, trailing off as his eyes 
drifted toward me. “Maybe not. Don’t let Emmett go 
alone, you know how he gets. At least ask Alice keep 
an eye on things. We’ll figure this out later.” 

He snapped the phone shut. “Where’s the paper?” he 
asked me. 



245 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Um, I’m not sure. Why?” 



“I need to see something. Did Charlie already throw it 
out?” 

“Maybe... .” 

Edward disappeared. 

He was back in half a second, new diamonds in his 
hair, a wet newspaper in his hands. He spread it out 
on the table, his eyes scanning quickly across the 
headlines. He leaned in, intent on something he was 
reading, one finger tracing passages that interested 
him most. 

“Carlisle’s right ... yes ... very sloppy. Young and 
crazed? Or a death wish?” he muttered to himself. 

I went to peek over his shoulder. 

The headline of the Seattle Times read: “Murder 
Epidemic Continues — Police Have No New Leads.” 

It was almost the same story Charlie had been 
complaining about a few weeks ago — the big-city 
violence that was pushing Seattle up the national 
murder hot-spot list. It wasn’t exactly the same story, 
though. The numbers were a lot higher. 

“It’s getting worse,” I murmured. 

He frowned. “Altogether out of control. This can’t be 
the work of just one newborn vampire. What’s going 
on? It’s as if they’ve never heard of the Volturi. Which 
is possible, I guess. No one has explained the rules to 
them ... so who is creating them, then?” 

“The Volturi?” I repeated, shuddering. 

246 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“This is exactly the kind of thing they routinely wipe 
out — immortals who threaten to expose us. They 
just cleaned up a mess like this a few years ago in 
Atlanta, and it hadn’t gotten nearly this bad. They will 
intervene soon, very soon, unless we can find some 
way to calm the situation. I’d really rather they didn’t 
come to Seattle just now. As long as they’re this close 
... they might decide to check on you.” 

I shuddered again. “What can we do?” 

“We need to know more before we can decide that. 
Perhaps if we can talk to these young ones, explain 
the rules, it can be resolved peacefully.” He frowned, 
like he didn’t think the chances of that were good. 
“Well wait until Alice has an idea of what’s going on... 

. We don’t want to step in until it’s absolutely 
necessary. After all, it’s not our responsibility. But it’s 
good we have Jasper,” he added, almost to himself. “If 
we are dealing with newborns, he’ll be helpful.” 

“Jasper? Why?” 

Edward smiled darkly. “Jasper is sort of an expert on 
young vampires.” 

“What do you mean, an expert?” 

“You’ll have to ask him — the story is involved.” 

“What a mess,” I mumbled. 

“It does feel that way, doesn’t it? Like it’s coming at 
us from all sides these days.” He sighed. “Do you ever 
think that your life might be easier if you weren’t in 
love with me?” 

“Maybe. It wouldn’t be much of a life, though.” 



247 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“For me,” he amended quietly. “And now, I suppose,” 
he continued with a wry smile, “you have something 
you want to ask me?” 

I stared at him blankly. “I do?” 

“Or maybe not.” He grinned. “I was rather under the 
impression that you’d promised to ask my permission 
to go to some kind of werewolf soiree tonight.” 

“Eavesdropping again?” 

He grinned. “Just a bit, at the very end.” 

“Well, I wasn’t going to ask you anyway. I figured you 
had enough to stress about.” 

He put his hand under my chin, and held my face so 
that he could read my eyes. “Would you like to go?” 

“It’s no big thing. Don’t worry about it.” 

“You don’t have to ask my permission, Bella. I’m not 
your father — thank heaven for that. Perhaps you 
should ask Charlie, though.” 

“But you know Charlie will say yes.” 

“I do have a bit more insight into his probable answer 
than most people would, it’s true.” 

I just stared at him, trying to understand what he 
wanted, and trying to put out of my mind the 
yearning I felt to go to La Push so that I wouldn’t be 
swayed by my own wishes. It was stupid to want to go 
hang out with a bunch of big idiot wolf-boys right now 
when there was so much that was frightening and 
unexplained going on. Of course, that was exactly 
why I wanted to go. I wanted to escape the death 
248 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




threats, for just a few hours ... to be the less-mature, 
more-reckless Bella who could laugh it off with Jacob, 
if only briefly. But that didn’t matter. 

“Bella,” Edward said. “I told you that I was going to be 
reasonable and trust your judgment. I meant that. If 
you trust the werewolves, then I’m not going to worry 
about them.” 

“Wow,” I said, as I had last night. 

“And Jacob’s right — about one thing, anyway — a 
pack of werewolves ought to be enough to protect 
even you for one evening.” 

“Are you sure?” 

“Of course. Only ...” 

I braced myself. 

“I hope you won’t mind taking a few precautions? 
Allowing me to drive you to the boundary line, for 
one. And then taking a cell phone, so that I’ll know 
when to pick you up?” 

“That sounds ... very reasonable.” 

“Excellent.” 

He smiled at me, and I could see no trace of 
apprehension in his jewel-like eyes. 

To no one’s surprise, Charlie had no problem at all 
with me going to La Push for a bonfire. Jacob crowed 
with undisguised exultation when I called to give him 
the news, and he seemed eager enough to embrace 
Edward’s safety measures. He promised to meet us at 
the line between territories at six. 

249 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I had decided, after a short internal debate, that I 
would not sell my motorcycle. I would take it back to 
La Push where it belonged and, when I no longer 
needed it anymore ... well, then, I would insist that 
Jacob profit from his work somehow. He could sell it 
or give it to a friend. It didn’t matter to me. 

Tonight seemed like a good opportunity to return the 
bike to Jacob’s garage. As gloomy as I was feeling 
about things lately, every day seemed like a possible 
last chance. I didn’t have time to procrastinate any 
task, no matter how minor. 

Edward only nodded when I explained what I wanted, 
but I thought I saw a flicker of consternation in his 
eyes, and I knew he was no happier about the idea of 
me on a motorcycle than Charlie was. 

I followed him back to his house, to the garage where 
I’d left the bike. It wasn’t until I pulled the truck in 
and got out that I realized the consternation might 
not be entirely about my safety this time. 

Next to my little antique motorcycle, overshadowing 
it, was another vehicle. To call this other vehicle a 
motorcycle hardly seemed fair, since it didn’t seem to 
belong to the same family as my suddenly shabby- 
looking bike. 

It was big and sleek and silver and — even totally 
motionless — it looked fast. 

“What is that?” 

“Nothing,” Edward murmured. 

“It doesn’t look like nothing.”

Edward’s expression was casual; he seemed 
determined to blow it off. “Well, I didn’t know if you 
were going to forgive your friend, or he you, and I 
wondered if you would still want to ride your bike 
anyway. It sounded like it was something that you 
enjoyed. I thought I could go with you, if you wished.” 
He shrugged. 

I stared at the beautiful machine. Beside it, my bike 
looked like a broken tricycle. I felt a sudden wave of 
sadness when I realized that this was not a bad 
analogy for the way I probably looked next to Edward. 

“I wouldn’t be able to keep up with you,” I whispered. 

Edward put his hand under my chin and pulled my 
face around so that he could see it straight on. With 
one finger, he tried to push the corner of my mouth 
up. 

“I’d keep pace with you, Bella.” 

“That wouldn’t be much fun for you.” 

“Of course it would, if we were together.” 

I bit my lip and imagined it for a moment. “Edward, if 
you thought I was going too fast or losing control of 
the bike or something, what would you do?” 

He hesitated, obviously trying to find the right 
answer. I knew the truth: he’d find some way to save 
me before I crashed. 

Then he smiled. It looked effortless, except for the tiny 
defensive tightening of his eyes. 

“This is something you do with Jacob. I see that now.”

“It’s just that, well, I don’t slow him down so much, 
you know. I could try, I guess... .” 

I eyed the silver motorcycle doubtfully. 

“Don’t worry about it,” Edward said, and then he 
laughed lightly. “I saw Jasper admiring it. Perhaps it’s 
time he discovered a new way to travel. After all, Alice 
has her Porsche now.” 

“Edward, I — ” 

He interrupted me with a quick kiss. “I said not to 
worry. But would you do something for me?” 

“Whatever you need,” I promised quickly. 

He dropped my face and leaned over the far side of 
the big motorcycle, retrieving something he had 
stashed there. 

He came back with one object that was black and 
shapeless, and another that was red and easily 
identifiable. 

“Please?” he asked, flashing the crooked smile that 
always destroyed my resistance. 

I took the red helmet, weighing it in my hands. “I’ll 
look stupid.” 

“No, you’ll look smart. Smart enough not to get 
yourself hurt.” He threw the black thing, whatever it 
was, over his arm and then took my face in his 
hands. “There are things between my hands right now 
that I can’t live without. You could take care of them.” 

“Okay, fine. What’s that other thing?” I asked 
suspiciously.

He laughed and shook out some kind of padded 
jacket. “It’s a riding jacket. I hear road rash is quite 
uncomfortable, not that I would know myself.” 

He held it out for me. With a deep sigh, I flipped my 
hair back and stuffed the helmet on my head. Then I 
shoved my arms through the sleeves of the jacket. He 
zipped me in, a smile playing around the corners of 
his lips, and took a step back. 

I felt bulky. 

“Be honest, how hideous do I look?” 

He took another step back and pursed his lips. 

“That bad, huh?” I muttered. 

“No, no, Bella. Actually ...” he seemed to be struggling 
for the right word. “You look ... sexy.” 

I laughed out loud. “Right.” 

“Very sexy, really.” 

“You are just saying that so that I’ll wear it,” I said. 
“But that’s okay. You’re right, it’s smarter.” 

He wrapped his arms around me and pulled me 
against his chest. “You’re silly. I suppose that’s part 
of your charm. Though, I’ll admit it, this helmet does 
have its drawbacks.” 

And then he pulled the helmet off so that he could 
kiss me. 

As Edward drove me toward La Push a little while 
later, I realized that this unprecedented situation felt 



253 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




oddly familiar. It took me a moment of thought to 
pinpoint the source of the deja vu. 

“You know what this reminds me of?” I asked. “It’s 
just like when I was a kid and Renee would pass me 
off to Charlie for the summer. I feel like a seven-year- 
old.” 

Edward laughed. 

I didn’t mention it out loud, but the biggest difference 
between the two circumstances was that Renee and 
Charlie had been on better terms. 

About halfway to La Push, we rounded the corner and 
found Jacob leaning against the side of the red 
Volkswagen he’d built for himself out of scraps. 
Jacob’s carefully neutral expression dissolved into a 
smile when I waved from the front seat. 

Edward parked the Volvo thirty yards away. 

“Call me whenever you’re ready to come home,” he 
said. “And I’ll be here.” 

“I won’t be out late,” I promised. 

Edward pulled the bike and my new gear out of the 
trunk of his car — I’d been quite impressed that it 
had all fit. But it wasn’t so hard to manage when you 
were strong enough to juggle full-sized vans, let alone 
small motorcycles. 

Jacob watched, making no move to approach, his 
smile gone and his dark eyes indecipherable. 

I tucked the helmet under my arm and threw the 
jacket across the seat. 



254 | P a g e

“Do you have it all?” Edward asked. 

“No problem,” I assured him. 

He sighed and leaned toward me. I turned my face up 
for a goodbye peck, but Edward took me by surprise, 
fastening his arms tightly around me and kissing me 
with as much enthusiasm as he had in the garage — 
before long, I was gasping for air. 

Edward laughed quietly at something, and then let 
me go. 

“Goodbye,” he said. “I really do like the jacket.” 

As I turned away from him, I thought I saw a flash of 
something in his eyes that I wasn’t supposed to see. I 
couldn’t tell for sure what it was exactly. Worry, 
maybe. For a second I thought it was panic. But I was 
probably just making something out of nothing, as 
usual. 

I could feel his eyes on my back as I pushed my bike 
toward the invisible vampire-werewolf treaty line to 
meet Jacob. 

“What’s all that?” Jacob called to me, his voice wary, 
scrutinizing the motorcycle with an enigmatic 
expression. 

“I thought I should put this back where it belongs,” I 
told him. 

He pondered that for one short second, and then his 
wide smile stretched across his face. 

I knew the exact point that I was in werewolf territory 
because Jacob shoved away from his car and loped 
quickly over to me, closing the distance in three long 

255 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




strides. He took the bike from me, balanced it on the 
kickstand, and grabbed me up in another vice-tight 
hug. 

I heard the Volvo’s engine growl, and I struggled to get 
free. 

“Cut it out, Jake!” I gasped breathlessly. 

He laughed and set me down. I turned to wave 
goodbye, but the silver car was already disappearing 
around the curve in the road. 

“Nice,” I commented, allowing some acid to leak into 
my voice. 

His eyes widened in false innocence. “What?” 

“He’s being pretty dang pleasant about this; you don’t 
need to push your luck.” 

He laughed again, louder than before — he found 
what I’d said very funny indeed. I tried to see the joke 
as he walked around the Rabbit to hold my door open 
for me. 

“Bella,” he finally said — still chuckling — as he shut 
the door behind me, “you can’t push what you don’t 
have.”

“Are you gonna eat that Hot Dog?” Paul asked Jacob, 
his eyes locked on the last remnant of the huge meal 
the werewolves had consumed. 

Jacob leaned back against my knees and toyed with 
the hot dog he had spitted on a straightened wire 
hanger; the flames at the edge of the bonfire licked 
along its blistered skin. He heaved a sigh and patted 
his stomach. It was somehow still flat, though I’d lost 
count of how many hot dogs he’d eaten after his 
tenth. Not to mention the super-sized bag of chips or 
the two-liter bottle of root beer. 

“I guess,” Jake said slowly. “I’m so full I’m about to 
puke, but I think I can force it down. I won’t enjoy it 
at all, though.” He sighed again sadly. 

Despite the fact that Paul had eaten at least as much 
as Jacob, he glowered and his hands balled up into 
fists. 

“Sheesh.” Jacob laughed. “Kidding, Paul. Here.” 

He flipped the homemade skewer across the circle. I 
expected it to land hot-dog-first in the sand, but Paul 
caught it neatly on the right end without difficulty. 

Hanging out with no one but extremely dexterous 
people all the time was going to give me a complex. 

“Thanks, man,” Paul said, already over his brief fit of 
temper. 



257 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



The fire crackled, settling lower toward the sand. 
Sparks blew up in a sudden puff of brilliant orange 
against the black sky. Funny, I hadn’t noticed that 
the sun had set. For the first time, I wondered how 
late it had gotten. I’d lost track of time completely. 

It was easier being with my Quileute friends than I’d 
expected. 

While Jacob and I had dropped off my bike at the 
garage — and he had admitted ruefully that the 
helmet was a good idea that he should have thought 
of himself — I’d started to worry about showing up 
with him at the bonfire, wondering if the werewolves 
would consider me a traitor now. Would they be angry 
with Jacob for inviting me? Would I ruin the party? 

But when Jacob had towed me out of the forest to the 
clifftop meeting place — where the fire already roared 
brighter than the cloud-obscured sun — it had all 
been very casual and light. 

“Hey, vampire girl!” Embry had greeted me loudly. 

Quil had jumped up to give me a high five and kiss 
me on the cheek. Emily had squeezed my hand when 
we’d sat on the cool stone ground beside her and 
Sam. 

Other than a few teasing complaints — mostly by 
Paul — about keeping the bloodsucker stench 
downwind, I was treated like someone who belonged. 

It wasn’t just kids in attendance, either. Billy was 
here, his wheelchair stationed at what seemed the 
natural head of the circle. Beside him on a folding 
lawn chair, looking quite brittle, was Quil’s ancient, 
white-haired grandfather, Old Quil. Sue Clearwater, 
widow of Charlie’s friend Harry, had a chair on his 
other side; her two children, Leah and Seth, were also 
258 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




there, sitting on the ground like the rest of us. This 
surprised me, but all three were clearly in on the 
secret now. From the way Billy and Old Quil spoke to 
Sue, it sounded to me like she’d taken Harry’s place 
on the council. Did that make her children automatic 
members of La Push’s most secret society? 

I wondered how horrible it was for Leah to sit across 
the circle from Sam and Emily. Her lovely face 
betrayed no emotion, but she never looked away from 
the flames. Looking at the perfection of Leah’s 
features, I couldn’t help but compare them to Emily’s 
ruined face. What did Leah think of Emily’s scars, 
now that she knew the truth behind them? Did it 
seem like justice in her eyes? 

Little Seth Clearwater wasn’t so little anymore. With 
his huge, happy grin and his long, gangly build, he 
reminded me very much of a younger Jacob. The 
resemblance made me smile, and then sigh. Was Seth 
doomed to have his life change as drastically as the 
rest of these boys? Was that future why he and his 
family were allowed to be here? 

The whole pack was there: Sam with his Emily, Paul, 
Embry, Quil, and Jared with Kim, the girl he’d 
imprinted upon. 

My first impression of Kim was that she was a nice 
girl, a little shy, and a little plain. She had a wide 
face, mostly cheekbones, with eyes too small to 
balance them out. Her nose and mouth were both too 
broad for traditional beauty. Her flat black hair was 
thin and wispy in the wind that never seemed to let 
up atop the cliff. 

That was my first impression. But after a few hours of 
watching Jared watch Kim, I could no longer find 
anything plain about the girl. 

259 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




The way he stared at her! It was like a blind man 
seeing the sun for the first time. Like a collector 
finding an undiscovered Da Vinci, like a mother 
looking into the face of her newborn child. 

His wondering eyes made me see new things about 
her — how her skin looked like russet-colored silk in 
the firelight, how the shape of her lips was a perfect 
double curve, how white her teeth were against them, 
how long her eyelashes were, brushing her cheek 
when she looked down. 

Kim’s skin sometimes darkened when she met Jared’s 
awed gaze, and her eyes would drop as if in 
embarrassment, but she had a hard time keeping her 
eyes away from his for any length of time. 

Watching them, I felt like I better understood what 
Jacob had told me about imprinting before — it’s 
hard to resist that level of commitment and adoration. 

Kim was nodding off now against Jared’s chest, his 
arms around her. I imagined she would be very warm 
there. 

“It’s getting late,” I murmured to Jacob. 

“Don’t start that yet,” Jacob whispered back — 
though certainly half the group here had hearing 
sensitive enough to hear us anyway. “The best part is 
coming.” 

“What’s the best part? You swallowing an entire cow 
whole?” 

Jacob chuckled his low, throaty laugh. “No. That’s the 
finale. We didn’t meet just to eat through a week’s 
worth of food. This is technically a council meeting. 

It’s Quil’s first time, and he hasn’t heard the stories 

260 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




yet. Well, he’s heard them, but this will be the first 
time he knows they’re true. That tends to make a guy 
pay closer attention. Kim and Seth and Leah are all 
first-timers, too.” 

“Stories?” 

Jacob scooted back beside me, where I rested against 
a low ridge of rock. He put his arm over my shoulder 
and spoke even lower into my ear. 

“The histories we always thought were legends,” he 
said. “The stories of how we came to be. The first is 
the story of the spirit warriors.” 

It was almost as if Jacob’s soft whisper was the 
introduction. The atmosphere changed abruptly 
around the low-burning fire. Paul and Embry sat up 
straighter. Jared nudged Kim and then pulled her 
gently upright. 

Emily produced a spiral-bound notebook and a pen, 
looking exactly like a student set for an important 
lecture. Sam twisted just slightly beside her — so that 
he was facing the same direction as Old Quil, who 
was on his other side — and suddenly I realized that 
the elders of the council here were not three, but four 
in number. 

Leah Clearwater, her face still a beautiful and 
emotionless mask, closed her eyes — not like she was 
tired, but as if to help her concentration. Her brother 
leaned in toward the elders eagerly. 

The fire crackled, sending another explosion of sparks 
glittering up against the night. 

Billy cleared his throat, and, with no more 
introduction than his son’s whisper, began telling the 

261 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




story in his rich, deep voice. The words poured out 
with precision, as if he knew them by heart, but also 
with feeling and a subtle rhythm. Like poetry 
performed by its author. 

“The Quileutes have been a small people from the 
beginning,” Billy said. “And we are a small people 
still, but we have never disappeared. This is because 
there has always been magic in our blood. It wasn’t 
always the magic of shape-shifting — that came later. 
First, we were spirit warriors.” 

Never before had I recognized the ring of majesty that 
was in Billy Black’s voice, though I realized now that 
this authority had always been there. 

Emily’s pen sprinted across the sheets of paper as she 
tried to keep up with him. 

“In the beginning, the tribe settled in this harbor and 
became skilled ship builders and fishermen. But the 
tribe was small, and the harbor was rich in fish. 

There were others who coveted our land, and we were 
too small to hold it. A larger tribe moved against us, 
and we took to our ships to escape them. 

“Kaheleha was not the first spirit warrior, but we do 
not remember the stories that came before his. We do 
not remember who was the first to discover this 
power, or how it had been used before this crisis. 
Kaheleha was the first great Spirit Chief in our 
history. In this emergency, Kaheleha used the magic 
to defend our land. 

“He and all his warriors left the ship — not their 
bodies, but their spirits. Their women watched over 
the bodies and the waves, and the men took their 
spirits back to our harbor. 



262 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“They could not physically touch the enemy tribe, but 
they had other ways. The stories tell us that they 
could blow fierce winds into their enemy’s camps; 
they could make a great screaming in the wind that 
terrified their foes. The stories also tell us that the 
animals could see the spirit warriors and understand 
them; the animals would do their bidding. 

“Kaheleha took his spirit army and wreaked havoc on 
the intruders. This invading tribe had packs of big, 
thick-furred dogs that they used to pull their sleds in 
the frozen north. The spirit warriors turned the dogs 
against their masters and then brought a mighty 
infestation of bats up from the cliff caverns. They 
used the screaming wind to aid the dogs in confusing 
the men. The dogs and bats won. The survivors 
scattered, calling our harbor a cursed place. The dogs 
ran wild when the spirit warriors released them. The 
Quileutes returned to their bodies and their wives, 
victorious. 

“The other nearby tribes, the Hohs and the Makahs, 
made treaties with the Quileutes. They wanted 
nothing to do with our magic. We lived in peace with 
them. When an enemy came against us, the spirit 
warriors would drive them off. 

“Generations passed. Then came the last great Spirit 
Chief, Taha Aki. He was known for his wisdom, and 
for being a man of peace. The people lived well and 
content in his care. 

“But there was one man, Utlapa, who was not 
content.” 

A low hiss ran around the fire. I was too slow to see 
where it came from. Billy ignored it and went on with 
the legend. 



263 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Utlapa was one of Chief Taha Aki’s strongest spirit 
warriors — a powerful man, but a grasping man, too. 
He thought the people should use their magic to 
expand their lands, to enslave the Hohs and the 
Makahs and build an empire. 

“Now, when the warriors were their spirit selves, they 
knew each other’s thoughts. Taha Aki saw what 
Utlapa dreamed, and was angry with Utlapa. Utlapa 
was commanded to leave the people, and never use 
his spirit self again. Utlapa was a strong man, but the 
chiefs warriors outnumbered him. He had no choice 
but to leave. The furious outcast hid in the forest 
nearby, waiting for a chance to get revenge against 
the chief. 

“Even in times of peace, the Spirit Chief was vigilant 
in protecting his people. Often, he would go to a 
sacred, secret place in the mountains. He would leave 
his body behind and sweep down through the forests 
and along the coast, making sure no threat 
approached. 

“One day when Taha Aki left to perform this duty, 
Utlapa followed. At first, Utlapa simply planned to kill 
the chief, but this plan had its drawbacks. Surely the 
spirit warriors would seek to destroy him, and they 
could follow faster than he could escape. As he hid in 
the rocks and watched the chief prepare to leave his 
body, another plan occurred to him. 

“Taha Aki left his body in the secret place and flew 
with the winds to keep watch over his people. Utlapa 
waited until he was sure the chief had traveled some 
distance with his spirit self. 

“Taha Aki knew it the instant that Utlapa had joined 
him in the spirit world, and he also knew Utlapa’s 
murderous plan. He raced back to his secret place, 

264 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




but even the winds weren’t fast enough to save him. 
When he returned, his body was already gone. 

Utlapa’s body lay abandoned, but Utlapa had not left 
Taha Aki with an escape — he had cut his own body’s 
throat with Taha Aki’s hands. 

“Taha Aki followed his body down the mountain. He 
screamed at Utlapa, but Utlapa ignored him as if he 
were mere wind. 

“Taha Aki watched with despair as Utlapa took his 
place as chief of the Quileutes. For a few weeks, 

Utlapa did nothing but make sure that everyone 
believed he was Taha Aki. Then the changes began — 
Utlapa’s first edict was to forbid any warrior to enter 
the spirit world. He claimed that he’d had a vision of 
danger, but really he was afraid. He knew that Taha 
Aki would be waiting for the chance to tell his story. 
Utlapa was also afraid to enter the spirit world 
himself, knowing Taha Aki would quickly claim his 
body. So his dreams of conquest with a spirit warrior 
army were impossible, and he sought to content 
himself with ruling over the tribe. He became a 
burden — seeking privileges that Taha Aki had never 
requested, refusing to work alongside his warriors, 
taking a young second wife and then a third, though 
Taha Aki’s wife lived on — something unheard of in 
the tribe. Taha Aki watched in helpless fury. 

“Eventually, Taha Aki tried to kill his body to save the 
tribe from Utlapa’s excesses. He brought a fierce wolf 
down from the mountains, but Utlapa hid behind his 
warriors. When the wolf killed a young man who was 
protecting the false chief, Taha Aki felt horrible grief. 
He ordered the wolf away. 

“All the stories tell us that it was no easy thing to be a 
spirit warrior. It was more frightening than 
exhilarating to be freed from one’s body. This is why 

265 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




they only used their magic in times of need. The 
chiefs solitary journeys to keep watch were a burden 
and a sacrifice. Being bodiless was disorienting, 
uncomfortable, horrifying. Taha Aki had been away 
from his body for so long at this point that he was in 
agony. He felt he was doomed — never to cross over 
to the final land where his ancestors waited, stuck in 
this torturous nothingness forever. 

“The great wolf followed Taha Aki’s spirit as he 
twisted and writhed in agony through the woods. The 
wolf was very large for its kind, and beautiful. Taha 
Aki was suddenly jealous of the dumb animal. At 
least it had a body. At least it had a life. Even life as 
an animal would be better than this horrible empty 
consciousness. 

“And then Taha Aki had the idea that changed us all. 
He asked the great wolf to make room for him, to 
share. The wolf complied. Taka Aki entered the wolfs 
body with relief and gratitude. It was not his human 
body, but it was better than the void of the spirit 
world. 

“As one, the man and the wolf returned to the village 
on the harbor. The people ran in fear, shouting for the 
warriors to come. The warriors ran to meet the wolf 
with their spears. Utlapa, of course, stayed safely 
hidden. 

“Taha Aki did not attack his warriors. He retreated 
slowly from them, speaking with his eyes and trying 
to yelp the songs of his people. The warriors began to 
realize that the wolf was no ordinary animal, that 
there was a spirit influencing it. One older warrior, a 
man name Yut, decided to disobey the false chiefs 
order and try to communicate with the wolf. 



266 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“As soon as Yut crossed to the spirit world, Taha Aki 
left the wolf — the animal waited tamely for his return 
— to speak to him. Yut gathered the truth in an 
instant, and welcomed his true chief home. 

“At this time, Utlapa came to see if the wolf had been 
defeated. When he saw Yut lying lifeless on the 
ground, surrounded by protective warriors, he 
realized what was happening. He drew his knife and 
raced forward to kill Yut before he could return to his 
body. 

“Traitor,’ he screamed, and the warriors did not know 
what to do. The chief had forbidden spirit journeys, 
and it was the chiefs decision how to punish those 
who disobeyed. 

“Yut jumped back into his body, but Utlapa had his 
knife at his throat and a hand covering his mouth. 
Taha Aki’s body was strong, and Yut was weak with 
age. Yut could not say even one word to warn the 
others before Utlapa silenced him forever. 

“Taha Aki watched as Yut’s spirit slipped away to the 
final lands that were barred to Taha Aki for all 
eternity. He felt a great rage, more powerful than 
anything he’d felt before. He entered the big wolf 
again, meaning to rip Utlapa’s throat out. But, as he 
joined the wolf, the greatest magic happened. 

“Taha Aki’s anger was the anger of a man. The love he 
had for his people and the hatred he had for their 
oppressor were too vast for the wolf’s body, too 
human. The wolf shuddered, and — before the eyes of 
the shocked warriors and Utlapa — transformed into 
a man. 

“The new man did not look like Taha Aki’s body. He 
was far more glorious. He was the flesh interpretation 

267 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




of Taha Aki’s spirit. The warriors recognized him at 
once, though, for they had flown with Taha Aki’s 
spirit. 

“Utlapa tried to run, but Taha Aki had the strength of 
the wolf in his new body. He caught the thief and 
crushed the spirit from him before he could jump out 
of the stolen body. 

“The people rejoiced when they understood what had 
happened. Taha Aki quickly set everything right, 
working again with his people and giving the young 
wives back to their families. The only change he kept 
in place was the end of the spirit travels. He knew 
that it was too dangerous now that the idea of 
stealing a life was there. The spirit warriors were no 
more. 

“From that point on, Taha Aki was more than either 
wolf or man. They called him Taha Aki the Great Wolf, 
or Taha Aki the Spirit Man. He led the tribe for many, 
many years, for he did not age. When danger 
threatened, he would resume his wolf-self to fight or 
frighten the enemy. The people dwelt in peace. Taha 
Aki fathered many sons, and some of these found 
that, after they had reached the age of manhood, 
they, too, could transform into wolves. The wolves 
were all different, because they were spirit wolves and 
reflected the man they were inside.” 

“So that’s why Sam is all black,” Quil muttered under 
his breath, grinning. “Black heart, black fur.” 

I was so involved in the story, it was a shock to come 
back to the present, to the circle around the dying 
fire. With another shock, I realized that the circle was 
made up of Taha Aki’s great — to however many 
degrees — grandsons. 



268 | P a g e

The fire threw a volley of sparks into the sky, and 
they shivered and danced, making shapes that were 
almost decipherable. 

“And your chocolate fur reflects what?” Sam 
whispered back to Quil. “How sweet you are?” 

Billy ignored their jibes. “Some of the sons became 
warriors with Taha Aki, and they no longer aged. 
Others, who did not like the transformation, refused 
to join the pack of wolf-men. These began to age 
again, and the tribe discovered that the wolf-men 
could grow old like anyone else if they gave up their 
spirit wolves. Taha Aki had lived the span of three old 
men’s lives. He had married a third wife after the 
deaths of the first two, and found in her his true 
spirit wife. Though he had loved the others, this was 
something else. He decided to give up his spirit wolf 
so that he would die when she did. 

“That is how the magic came to us, but it is not the 
end of the story... .” 

He looked at Old Quil Ateara, who shifted in his chair, 
straightening his frail shoulders. Billy took a drink 
from a bottle of water and wiped his forehead. Emily’s 
pen never hesitated as she scribbled furiously on the 
paper. 

“That was the story of the spirit warriors,” Old Quil 
began in a thin tenor voice. “This is the story of the 
third wife’s sacrifice. 

“Many years after Taha Aki gave up his spirit wolf, 
when he was an old man, trouble began in the north, 
with the Makahs. Several young women of their tribe 
had disappeared, and they blamed it on the 
neighboring wolves, who they feared and mistrusted. 
The wolf-men could still read each other’s thoughts 
269 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




while in their wolf forms, just like their ancestors had 
while in their spirit forms. They knew that none of 
their number was to blame. Taha Aki tried to pacify 
the Makah chief, but there was too much fear. Taha 
Aki did not want to have a war on his hands. He was 
no longer a warrior to lead his people. He charged his 
oldest wolf-son, Taha Wi, with finding the true culprit 
before hostilities began. 

“Taha Wi led the five other wolves in his pack on a 
search through the mountains, looking for any 
evidence of the missing Makahs. They came across 
something they had never encountered before — a 
strange, sweet scent in the forest that burned their 
noses to the point of pain.” 

I shrank a little closer to Jacob’s side. I saw the 
corner of his mouth twitch with humor, and his arm 
tightened around me. 

“They did not know what creature would leave such a 
scent, but they followed it,” Old Quil continued. His 
quavering voice did not have the majesty of Billy’s, 
but it had a strange, fierce edge of urgency about it. 
My pulse jumped as his words came faster. 

“They found faint traces of human scent, and human 
blood, along the trail. They were sure this was the 
enemy they were searching for. 

“The journey took them so far north that Taha Wi 
sent half the pack, the younger ones, back to the 
harbor to report to Taha Aki. 

“Taha Wi and his two brothers did not return. 

“The younger brothers searched for their elders, but 
found only silence. Taha Aki mourned for his sons. 

He wished to avenge his sons’ death, but he was old. 

270 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He went to the Makah chief in his mourning clothes 
and told him everything that had happened. The 
Makah chief believed his grief, and tensions ended 
between the tribes. 

“A year later, two Makah maidens disappeared from 
their homes on the same night. The Makahs called on 
the Quileute wolves at once, who found the same 
sweet stink all through the Makah village. The wolves 
went on the hunt again. 

“Only one came back. He was Yaha Uta, the oldest 
son of Taka Aki’s third wife, and the youngest in the 
pack. He brought something with him that had never 
been seen in all the days of the Quileutes — a 
strange, cold, stony corpse that he carried in pieces. 
All who were of Taha Aki’s blood, even those who had 
never been wolves, could smell the piercing smell of 
the dead creature. This was the enemy of the Makahs. 

“Yaha Uta described what had happened: he and his 
brothers had found the creature, who looked like a 
man but was hard as a granite rock, with the two 
Makah daughters. One girl was already dead, white 
and bloodless on the ground. The other was in the 
creature’s arms, his mouth at her throat. She may 
have been alive when they came upon the hideous 
scene, but the creature quickly snapped her neck and 
tossed her lifeless body to the ground when they 
approached. His white lips were covered in her blood, 
and his eyes glowed red. 

“Yaha Uta described the fierce strength and speed of 
the creature. One of his brothers quickly became a 
victim when he underestimated that strength. The 
creature ripped him apart like a doll. Yaha Uta and 
his other brother were more wary. They worked 
together, coming at the creature from the sides, 
outmaneuvering it. They had to reach the very limits 
271 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




of their wolf strength and speed, something that had 
never been tested before. The creature was hard as 
stone and cold as ice. They found that only their teeth 
could damage it. They began to rip small pieces of the 
creature apart while it fought them. 

“But the creature learned quickly, and soon was 
matching their maneuvers. It got its hands on Yaha 
Uta’s brother. Yaha Uta found an opening on the 
creature’s throat, and he lunged. His teeth tore the 
head off the creature, but the hands continued to 
mangle his brother. 

“Yaha Uta ripped the creature into unrecognizable 
chunks, tearing pieces apart in a desperate attempt to 
save his brother. He was too late, but, in the end, the 
creature was destroyed. 

“Or so they thought. Yaha Uta laid the reeking 
remains out to be examined by the elders. One 
severed hand lay beside a piece of the creature’s 
granite arm. The two pieces touched when the elders 
poked them with sticks, and the hand reached out 
towards the arm piece, trying to reassemble itself. 

“Horrified, the elders set fire to the remains. A great 
cloud of choking, vile smoke polluted the air. When 
there was nothing but ashes, they separated the 
ashes into many small bags and spread them far and 
wide — some in the ocean, some in the forest, some 
in the cliff caverns. Taha Aki wore one bag around his 
neck, so he would be warned if the creature ever tried 
to put himself together again.” 

Old Quil paused and looked at Billy. Billy pulled out a 
leather thong from around his neck. Hanging from 
the end was a small bag, blackened with age. A few 
people gasped. I might have been one of them. 



272 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“They called it The Cold One, the Blood Drinker, and 
lived in fear that it was not alone. They only had one 
wolf protector left, young Yaha Uta. 

“They did not have long to wait. The creature had a 
mate, another blood drinker, who came to the 
Quileutes seeking revenge. 

“The stories say that the Cold Woman was the most 
beautiful thing human eyes had ever seen. She looked 
like the goddess of the dawn when she entered the 
village that morning; the sun was shining for once, 
and it glittered off her white skin and lit the golden 
hair that flowed down to her knees. Her face was 
magical in its beauty, her eyes black in her white 
face. Some fell to their knees to worship her. 

“She asked something in a high, piercing voice, in a 
language no one had ever heard. The people were 
dumbfounded, not knowing how to answer her. There 
was none of Taha Aki’s blood among the witnesses 
but one small boy. He clung to his mother and 
screamed that the smell was hurting his nose. One of 
the elders, on his way to council, heard the boy and 
realized what had come among them. He yelled for the 
people to run. She killed him first. 

“There were twenty witnesses to the Cold Woman’s 
approach. Two survived, only because she grew 
distracted by the blood, and paused to sate her thirst. 
They ran to Taha Aki, who sat in counsel with the 
other elders, his sons, and his third wife. 

“Yaha Uta transformed into his spirit wolf as soon as 
he heard the news. He went to destroy the blood 
drinker alone. Taha Aki, his third wife, his sons, and 
his elders followed behind him. 



273 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“At first they could not find the creature, only the 
evidence of her attack. Bodies lay broken, a few 
drained of blood, strewn across the road where she’d 
appeared. Then they heard the screams and hurried 
to the harbor. 

“A handful of the Quileutes had run to the ships for 
refuge. She swam after them like a shark, and broke 
the bow of their boat with her incredible strength. 
When the ship sank, she caught those trying to swim 
away and broke them, too. 

“She saw the great wolf on the shore, and she forgot 
the fleeing swimmers. She swam so fast she was a 
blur and came, dripping and glorious, to stand before 
Yaha Uta. She pointed at him with one white finger 
and asked another incomprehensible question. Yaha 
Uta waited. 

“It was a close fight. She was not the warrior her mate 
had been. But Yaha Uta was alone — there was no 
one to distract her fury from him. 

“When Yaha Uta lost, Taha Aki screamed in defiance. 
He limped forward and shifted into an ancient, white- 
muzzled wolf. The wolf was old, but this was Taha Aki 
the Spirit Man, and his rage made him strong. The 
fight began again. 

“Taha Aki’s third wife had just seen her son die before 
her. Now her husband fought, and she had no hope 
that he could win. She’d heard every word the 
witnesses to the slaughter had told the council. She’d 
heard the story of Yaha Ufa’s first victory, and knew 
that his brother’s diversion had saved him. 

“The third wife grabbed a knife from the belt of one of 
the sons who stood beside her. They were all young 



274 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




sons, not yet men, and she knew they would die when 
their father failed. 



“The third wife ran toward the Cold Woman with the 
dagger raised high. The Cold Woman smiled, barely 
distracted from her fight with the old wolf. She had no 
fear of the weak human woman or the knife that 
would not even scratch her skin, and she was about 
to deliver the death blow to Taha Aki. 

“And then the third wife did something the Cold 
Woman did not expect. She fell to her knees at the 
blood drinker’s feet and plunged the knife into her 
own heart. 

“Blood spurted through the third wife’s fingers and 
splashed against the Cold Woman. The blood drinker 
could not resist the lure of the fresh blood leaving the 
third wife’s body. Instinctively, she turned to the 
dying woman, for one second entirely consumed by 
thirst. 

“Taha Aki’s teeth closed around her neck. 

“That was not the end of the fight, but Taha Aki was 
not alone now. Watching their mother die, two young 
sons felt such rage that they sprang forth as their 
spirit wolves, though they were not yet men. With 
their father, they finished the creature. 

“Taha Aki never rejoined the tribe. He never changed 
back to a man again. He lay for one day beside the 
body of the third wife, growling whenever anyone tried 
to touch her, and then he went into the forest and 
never returned. 

“Trouble with the cold ones was rare from that time 
on. Taha Aki’s sons guarded the tribe until their sons 
were old enough to take their places. There were 

275 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




never more than three wolves at a time. It was 
enough. Occasionally a blood drinker would come 
through these lands, but they were taken by surprise, 
not expecting the wolves. Sometimes a wolf would die, 
but never were they decimated again like that first 
time. They’d learned how to fight the cold ones, and 
they passed the knowledge on, wolf mind to wolf 
mind, spirit to spirit, father to son. 

“Time passed, and the descendants of Taha Aki no 
longer became wolves when they reached manhood. 
Only in a great while, if a cold one was near, would 
the wolves return. The cold ones always came in ones 
and twos, and the pack stayed small. 

“A bigger coven came, and your own great- 
grandfathers prepared to fight them off. But the 
leader spoke to Ephraim Black as if he were a man, 
and promised not to harm the Quileutes. His strange 
yellow eyes gave some proof to his claim that they 
were not the same as other blood drinkers. The 
wolves were outnumbered; there was no need for the 
cold ones to offer a treaty when they could have won 
the fight. Ephraim accepted. They’ve stayed true to 
their side, though their presence does tend to draw in 
others. 

“And their numbers have forced a larger pack than 
the tribe has ever seen,” Old Quil said, and for one 
moment his black eyes, all but buried in the wrinkles 
of skin folded around them, seemed to rest on me. 
“Except, of course, in Taha Aki’s time,” he said, and 
then he sighed. “And so the sons of our tribe again 
carry the burden and share the sacrifice their fathers 
endured before them.” 

All was silent for a long moment. The living 
descendants of magic and legend stared at one 



276 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




another across the fire with sadness in their eyes. All 
but one. 

“Burden,” he scoffed in a low voice. “I think it’s cool.” 
Quil’s full lower lip pouted out a little bit. 

Across the dying fire, Seth Clearwater — his eyes wide 
with adulation for the fraternity of tribal protectors — 
nodded his agreement. 

Billy chuckled, low and long, and the magic seemed 
to fade into the glowing embers. Suddenly, it was just 
a circle of friends again. Jared flicked a small stone at 
Quil, and everyone laughed when it made him jump. 
Low conversations murmured around us, teasing and 
casual. 

Leah Clearwater’s eyes did not open. I thought I saw 
something sparkling on her cheek like a tear, but 
when I looked back a moment later it was gone. 

Neither Jacob nor I spoke. He was so still beside me, 
his breath so deep and even, that I thought he might 
be close to sleep. 

My mind was a thousand years away. I was not 
thinking of Yaha Uta or the other wolves, or the 
beautiful Cold Woman — I could picture her only too 
easily. No, I was thinking of someone outside the 
magic altogether. I was trying to imagine the face of 
the unnamed woman who had saved the entire tribe, 
the third wife. 

Just a human woman, with no special gifts or powers. 
Physically weaker and slower than any of the 
monsters in the story. But she had been the key, the 
solution. She’d saved her husband, her young sons, 
her tribe. 



277 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I wish they’d remembered her name... . 

Something shook my arm. 

“C’mon, Bells,” Jacob said in my ear. “We’re here.” 

I blinked, confused because the fire seemed to have 
disappeared. I glared into the unexpected darkness, 
trying to make sense of my surroundings. It took me 
a minute to realize that I was no longer on the cliff. 
Jacob and I were alone. I was still under his arm, but 
I wasn’t on the ground anymore. 

How did I get in Jacob’s car? 

“Oh, crap!” I gasped as I realized that I had fallen 
asleep. “How late is it? Dang it, where’s that stupid 
phone?” I patted my pockets, frantic and coming up 
empty. 

“Easy. It’s not even midnight yet. And I already called 
him for you. Look — he’s waiting there.” 

“Midnight?” I repeated stupidly, still disoriented. I 
stared into the darkness, and my heartbeat picked up 
when my eyes made out the shape of the Volvo, thirty 
yards away. I reached for the door handle. 

“Here,” Jacob said, and he put a small shape into my 
other hand. The phone. 

“You called Edward for me?” 

My eyes were adjusted enough to see the bright gleam 
of Jacob’s smile. “I figured if I played nice, I’d get 
more time with you.” 



278 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Thanks, Jake,” I said, touched. “Really, thank you. 
And thanks for inviting me tonight. That was ...” 
Words failed me. “Wow. That was something else.” 

“And you didn’t even stay up to watch me swallow a 
cow.” He laughed. “No, I’m glad you liked it. It was ... 
nice for me. Having you there.” 

There was a movement in the dark distance — 
something pale ghosting against the black trees. 
Pacing? 

“Yeah, he’s not so patient, is he?” Jacob said, noticing 
my distraction. “Go ahead. But come back soon, 
okay?” 

“Sure, Jake,” I promised, cracking the car door open. 
Cold air washed across my legs and made me shiver. 

“Sleep tight, Bells. Don’t worry about anything — I’ll 
be watching out for you tonight.” 

I paused, one foot on the ground. “No, Jake. Get some 
rest, I’ll be fine.” 

“Sure, sure,” he said, but he sounded more 
patronizing than agreeing. 

“ ’Night, Jake. Thanks.” 

“’Night, Bella,” he whispered as I hurried into the 
darkness. 

Edward caught me at the boundary line. 

“Bella,” he said, relief strong in his voice; his arms 
wound tightly around me. 

“Hi. Sorry I’m so late. I fell asleep and — ” 

279 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I know. Jacob explained.” He started toward the car, 
and I staggered woodenly at his side. “Are you tired? I 
could carry you.” 

“I’m fine.” 

“Let’s get you home and in bed. Did you have a nice 
time?” 

“Yeah — it was amazing, Edward. I wish you could 
have come. I can’t even explain it. Jake’s dad told us 
the old legends and it was like ... like magic.” 

“You’ll have to tell me about it. After you’ve slept.” 

“I won’t get it right,” I said, and then I yawned hugely. 

Edward chuckled. He opened my door for me, lifted 
me in, and buckled my seat belt around me. 

Bright lights flashed on and swept across us. I waved 
toward Jacob’s headlights, but I didn’t know if he saw 
the gesture. 

That night — after I’d gotten past Charlie, who didn’t 
give me as much trouble as I’d expected because 
Jacob had called him, too — instead of collapsing in 
bed right away, I leaned out the open window while I 
waited for Edward to come back. The night was 
surprisingly cold, almost wintry. I hadn’t noticed it at 
all on the windy cliffs; I imagined that had less to do 
with the fire than it did with sitting next to Jacob. 

Icy droplets spattered against my face as the rain 
began to fall. 

It was too dark to see much besides the black 
triangles of the spruces leaning and shaking with the 
wind. But I strained my eyes anyway, searching for 

280 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




other shapes in the storm. A pale silhouette, moving 
like a ghost through the black ... or maybe the 
shadowy outline of an enormous wolf. . . . My eyes 
were too weak. 

Then there was a movement in the night, right beside 
me. Edward slid through my open window, his hands 
colder than the rain. 

“Is Jacob out there?” I asked, shivering as Edward 
pulled me into the circle of his arm. 

“Yes ... somewhere. And Esme’s on her way home.” 

I sighed. “It’s so cold and wet. This is silly.” I shivered 
again. 

He chuckled. “It’s only cold to you, Bella.” 

It was cold in my dream that night, too, maybe 
because I slept in Edward’s arms. But I dreamt I was 
outside in the storm, the wind whipping my hair in 
my face and blinding my eyes. I stood on the rocky 
crescent of First Beach, trying to understand the 
quickly moving shapes I could only dimly see in the 
darkness at the shore’s edge. At first, there was 
nothing but a flash of white and black, darting toward 
each other and dancing away. And then, as if the 
moon had suddenly broken from the clouds, I could 
see everything. 

Rosalie, her hair swinging wet and golden down to the 
back of her knees, was lunging at an enormous wolf 
— its muzzle shot through with silver — that I 
instinctively recognized as Billy Black. 

I broke into a run, but found myself moving in the 
frustrating slow motion of dreamers. I tried to scream 
to them, to tell them to stop, but my voice was stolen 

281 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




by the wind, and I could make no sound. I waved my 
arms, hoping to catch their attention. Something 
flashed in my hand, and I noticed for the first time 
that my right hand wasn’t empty. 

I held a long, sharp blade, ancient and silver, crusted 
in dried, blackened blood. 

I cringed away from the knife, and my eyes snapped 
open to the quiet darkness of my bedroom. The first 
thing I realized was that I was not alone, and I turned 
to bury my face in Edward’s chest, knowing the sweet 
scent of his skin would chase the nightmare away 
more effectively than anything else. 

“Did I wake you?” he whispered. There was the sound 
of paper, the ruffling of pages, and a faint thump as 
something light fell to the wooden floor. 

“No,” I mumbled, sighing in contentment as his arms 
tightened around me. “I had a bad dream.” 

“Do you want to tell me about it?” 

I shook my head. “Too tired. Maybe in the morning, if 
I remember.” 

I felt a silent laugh shake through him. 

“In the morning,” he agreed. 

“What were you reading?” I muttered, not really 
awake at all. 

“Wuthering Heights,” he said. 

I frowned sleepily. “I thought you didn’t like that 
book.” 



282 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You left it out,” he murmured, his soft voice lulling 
me toward unconsciousness. “Besides ... the more 
time I spend with you, the more human emotions 
seem comprehensible to me. I’m discovering that I 
can sympathize with Heathcliff in ways I didn’t think 
possible before.” 

“Mmm,” I sighed. 

He said something else, something low, but I was 
already asleep. 

The next morning dawned pearl gray and still. 

Edward asked me about my dream, but I couldn’t get 
a handle on it. I only remembered that I was cold, and 
that I was glad he was there when I woke up. He 
kissed me, long enough to get my pulse racing, and 
then headed home to change and get his car. 

I dressed quickly, low on options. Whoever had 
ransacked my hamper had critically impaired my 
wardrobe. If it wasn’t so frightening, it would be 
seriously annoying. 

As I was about to head down for breakfast, I noticed 
my battered copy of Wuthering Heights lying open on 
the floor where Edward had dropped it in the night, 
holding his place the way the damaged binding 
always held mine. 

I picked it up curiously, trying to remember what he’d 
said. Something about feeling sympathy for 
Heathcliff, of all people. That couldn’t be right; I must 
have dreamed that part. 

Three words on the open page caught my eye, and I 
bent my head to read the paragraph more closely. It 
was Heathcliff speaking, and I knew the passage well. 



283 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




And there you see the distinction between our 
feelings: had he been in my place and I in his, though 
I hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall, I 
never would have raised a hand against him. You may 
look incredulous, if you please! I never would have 
banished him from her society as long as she desired 
his. The moment her regard ceased, I would have torn 
his heart out, and drank his blood! But, till then — if 
you don’t believe me, you don’t know me — till then, I 
would have died by inches before I touched a single 
hair of his head! 

The three words that had caught my eye were “drank 
his blood.” 

I shuddered. 

Yes, surely I must have dreamt that Edward said 
anything positive about Heathcliff. And this page was 
probably not the page he’d been reading. The book 
could have fallen open to any page.

TIME 




“I have foreseen ... Alice began in an ominous tone. 

Edward threw an elbow toward her ribs, which she 
neatly dodged. 

“Fine,” she grumbled. “Edward is making me do this. 
But I did foresee that you would be more difficult if I 
surprised you.” 

We were walking to the car after school, and I was 
completely clueless as to what she was talking about. 

“In English?” I requested. 

“Don’t be a baby about this. No tantrums.” 

“Now I’m scared.” 

“So you’re — I mean we’re — having a graduation 
party. It’s no big thing. Nothing to freak out over. But 
I saw that you would freak out if I tried to make it a 
surprise party” — she danced out of the way as 
Edward reached over to muss her hair — “and 
Edward said I had to tell you. But it’s nothing. 
Promise.” 

I sighed heavily. “Is there any point in arguing?” 

“None at all.” 

“Okay, Alice. I’ll be there. And I’ll hate every minute of 
it. Promise.” 



285 I P a g e

“That’s the spirit! By the way, I love my gift. You 
shouldn’t have.” 

“Alice, I didn’t!” 

“Oh, I know that. But you will.” 

I racked my brains in panic, trying to remember what 
I’d ever decided to get her for graduation that she 
might have seen. 

“Amazing,” Edward muttered. “How can someone so 
tiny be so annoying?” 

Alice laughed. “It’s a talent.” 

“Couldn’t you have waited a few weeks to tell me 
about this?” I asked petulantly. “Now I’ll just be 
stressed that much longer.” 

Alice frowned at me. 

“Bella,” she said slowly. “Do you know what day it is?” 
“Monday?” 

She rolled her eyes. “Yes. It is Monday ... the fourth.” 
She grabbed my elbow, spun me halfway around, and 
pointed toward a big yellow poster taped to the gym 
door. There, in sharp black letters, was the date of 
graduation. Exactly one week from today. 

“It’s the fourth? Of June? Are you sure?” 

Neither one answered. Alice just shook her head 
sadly, feigning disappointment, and Edward’s 
eyebrows lifted. 



286 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“It can’t be! How did that happen?” I tried to count 
backwards in my head, but I couldn’t figure out 
where the days had gone. 

I felt like someone had kicked my legs out from under 
me. The weeks of stress, of worry ... somehow in the 
middle of all my obsessing over the time, my time had 
disappeared. My space for sorting through it all, for 
making plans, had vanished. I was out of time. 

And I wasn’t ready. 

I didn’t know how to do this. How to say goodbye to 
Charlie and Renee ... to Jacob ... to being human. 

I knew exactly what I wanted, but I was suddenly 
terrified of getting it. 

In theory, I was anxious, even eager to trade mortality 
for immortality. After all, it was the key to staying 
with Edward forever. And then there was the fact that 
I was being hunted by known and unknown parties. 

I’d rather not sit around, helpless and delicious, 
waiting for one of them to catch up with me. 

In theory, that all made sense. 

In practice . . . being human was all I knew. The future 
beyond that was a big, dark abyss that I couldn’t 
know until I leaped into it. 

This simple knowledge, today’s date — which was so 
obvious that I must have been subconsciously 
repressing it — made the deadline I’d been 
impatiently counting down toward feel like a date with 
the firing squad. 

In a vague way, I was aware of Edward holding the 
car door for me, of Alice chattering from the backseat, 

287 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




of the rain hammering against the windshield. 

Edward seemed to realize I was only there in body; he 
didn’t try to pull me out of my abstraction. Or maybe 
he did, and I was past noticing. 

We ended up at my house, where Edward led me to 
the sofa and pulled me down next to him. I stared out 
the window, into the liquid gray haze, and tried to 
find where my resolve had gone. Why was I panicking 
now? I’d known the deadline was coming. Why should 
it frighten me that it was here? 

I don’t know how long he let me stare out the window 
in silence. But the rain was disappearing into 
darkness when it was finally too much for him. 

He put his cold hands on either side of my face and 
fixed his golden eyes on mine. 

“Would you please tell me what you are thinking? 
Before I go mad?” 

What could I say to him? That I was a coward? I 
searched for words. 

“Your lips are white. Talk, Bella.” 

I exhaled in a big gust. How long had I been holding 
my breath? 

“The date took me off guard,” I whispered. “That’s all.” 

He waited, his face full of worry and skepticism. 

I tried to explain. “I’m not sure what to do ... what to 
tell Charlie ... what to say ... how to ...” My voice 
trailed off. 

“This isn’t about the party?” 

288 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I frowned. “No. But thanks for reminding me.” 

The rain was louder as he read my face. 

“You’re not ready,” he whispered. 

“I am,” I lied immediately, a reflex reaction. I could tell 
he saw through it, so I took a deep breath, and told 
the truth. “I have to be.” 

“You don’t have to be anything.” 

I could feel the panic surfacing in my eyes as I 
mouthed the reasons. “Victoria, Jane, Caius, whoever 
was in my room ... !” 

“All the more reason to wait.” 

“That doesn’t make any sense, Edward!” 

He pressed his hands more tightly to my face and 
spoke with slow deliberation. 

“Bella. Not one of us had a choice. You’ve seen what 
it’s done ... to Rosalie especially. We’ve all struggled, 
trying to reconcile ourselves with something we had 
no control over. I won’t let it be that way for you. You 
will have a choice.” 

“I’ve already made my choice.” 

“You aren’t going through with this because a sword 
is hanging over your head. We will take care of the 
problems, and I will take care of you,” he vowed. 
“When we’re through it, and there is nothing forcing 
your hand, then you can decide to join me, if you still 
want to. But not because you’re afraid. You won’t be 
forced into this.”

“Carlisle promised,” I mumbled, contrary out of habit. 
“After graduation.” 

“Not until you’re ready,” he said in a sure voice. “And 
definitely not while you feel threatened.” 

I didn’t answer. I didn’t have it in me to argue; I 
couldn’t seem to find my commitment at the moment. 

“There.” He kissed my forehead. “Nothing to worry 
about.” 

I laughed a shaky laugh. “Nothing but impending 
doom.” 

“Trust me.” 

“I do.” 

He was still watching my face, waiting for me to relax. 
“Can I ask you something?” I said. 

“Anything.” 

I hesitated, biting my lip, and then asked a different 
question than the one I was worried about. 

“What am I getting Alice for graduation?” 

He snickered. “It looked like you were getting us both 
concert tickets — ” 

“That’s right!” I was so relieved, I almost smiled. “The 
concert in Tacoma. I saw an ad in the paper last 
week, and I thought it would be something you’d like, 
since you said it was a good CD.” 

“It’s a great idea. Thank you.”

“I hope it’s not sold out.” 



“It’s the thought that counts. I ought to know.” 

I sighed. 

“There’s something else you meant to ask,” he said. 

I frowned. “You’re good.” 

“I have lots of practice reading your face. Ask me.” 

I closed my eyes and leaned into him, hiding my face 
against his chest. “You don’t want me to be a 
vampire.” 

“No, I don’t,” he said softly, and then he waited for 
more. “That’s not a question,” he prompted after a 
moment. 

“Well ... I was worrying about ... why you feel that 
way.” 

“Worrying?” He picked out the word with surprise. 

“Would you tell me why? The whole truth, not sparing 
my feelings?” 

He hesitated for a minute. “If I answer your question, 
will you then explain your question?” 

I nodded, my face still hidden. 

He took a deep breath before he answered. “You could 
do so much better, Bella. I know that you believe I 
have a soul, but I’m not entirely convinced on that 
point, and to risk yours ...” He shook his head slowly. 
“For me to allow this — to let you become what I am 
just so that I’ll never have to lose you — is the most 
291 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




selfish act I can imagine. I want it more than 
anything, for myself. But for you, I want so much 
more. Giving in — it feels criminal. It’s the most 
selfish thing 111 ever do, even if I live forever. 

“If there were any way for me to become human for 
you — no matter what the price was, I would pay it.” 

I sat very still, absorbing this. 

Edward thought he was being selfish. 

I felt the smile slowly spread across my face. 

“So ... it’s not that you’re afraid you won’t ... like me 
as much when I’m different — when I’m not soft and 
warm and I don’t smell the same? You really do want 
to keep me, no matter how I turn out?” 

He exhaled sharply. “You were worried I wouldn’t like 
you?” he demanded. Then, before I could answer, he 
was laughing. “Bella, for a fairly intuitive person, you 
can be so obtuse!” 

I knew he would think it silly, but I was relieved. If he 
really wanted me, I could get through the rest ... 
somehow. Selfish suddenly seemed like a beautiful 
word. 

“I don’t think you realize how much easier it will be 
for me, Bella,” he said, the echo of his humor still 
there in his voice, “when I don’t have to concentrate 
all the time on not killing you. Certainly, there are 
things I’ll miss. This for one ...” 

He stared into my eyes as he stroked my cheek, and I 
felt the blood rush up to color my skin. He laughed 
gently. 



292 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“And the sound of your heart,” he continued, more 
serious but still smiling a little. “It’s the most 
significant sound in my world. I’m so attuned to it 
now, I swear I could pick it out from miles away. But 
neither of these things matter. This,” he said, taking 
my face in his hands. “You. That’s what I’m keeping. 
You’ll always be my Bella, you’ll just be a little more 
durable.” 

I sighed and let my eyes close in contentment, resting 
there in his hands. 

“Now will you answer a question for me? The whole 
truth, not sparing my feelings?” he asked. 

“Of course,” I answered at once, my eyes opening wide 
with surprise. What would he want to know? 

He spoke the words slowly. “You don’t want to be my 
wife.” 

My heart stopped, and then broke into a sprint. A 
cold sweat dewed on the back of my neck and my 
hands turned to ice. 

He waited, watching and listening to my reaction. 

“That’s not a question,” I finally whispered. 

He looked down, his lashes casting long shadows 
across his cheekbones, and dropped his hands from 
my face to pick up my frozen left hand. He played 
with my fingers while he spoke. 

“I was worrying about why you felt that way.” 

I tried to swallow. “That’s not a question, either,” I 
whispered. 



293 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Please, Bella?” 



“The truth?” I asked, only mouthing the words. 

“Of course. I can take it, whatever it is.” 

I took a deep breath. “You’re going to laugh at me.” 

His eyes flashed up to mine, shocked. “Laugh? I 
cannot imagine that.” 

“You’ll see,” I muttered, and then I sighed. My face 
went from white to scarlet in a sudden blaze of 
chagrin. “Okay, fine! I’m sure this will sound like 
some big joke to you, but really! It’s just so ... so ... so 
embarrassing!” I confessed, and I hid my face against 
his chest again. 

There was a brief pause. 

“I’m not following you.” 

I tilted my head back and glared at him, 
embarrassment making me lash out, belligerent. 

“I’m not that girl, Edward. The one who gets married 
right out of high school like some small-town hick 
who got knocked up by her boyfriend! Do you know 
what people would think? Do you realize what 
century this is? People don’t just get married at 
eighteen! Not smart people, not responsible, mature 
people! I wasn’t going to be that girl! That’s not who I 
am... .” I trailed off, losing steam. 

Edward’s face was impossible to read as he thought 
through my answer. 

“That’s all?” he finally asked. 



294 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I blinked. “Isn’t that enough?” 



“It’s not that you were ... more eager for immortality 
itself than for just me?” 

And then, though I’d predicted that he would laugh, I 
was suddenly the one having hysterics. 

“Edward!” I gasped out between the paroxysms of 
giggles. “And here ... I always ... thought that ... you 
were ... so much ... smarter than me!” 

He took me in his arms, and I could feel that he was 
laughing with me. 

“Edward,” I said, managing to speak more clearly with 
a little effort, “there’s no point to forever without you. 

I wouldn’t want one day without you.” 

“Well, that’s a relief,” he said. 

“Still ... it doesn’t change anything.” 

“It’s nice to understand, though. And I do understand 
your perspective, Bella, truly I do. But I’d like it very 
much if you’d try to consider mine.” 

I’d sobered up by then, so I nodded and struggled to 
keep the frown off my face. 

His liquid gold eyes turned hypnotic as they held 
mine. 

“You see, Bella, I was always that boy. In my world, I 
was already a man. I wasn’t looking for love — no, I 
was far too eager to be a soldier for that; I thought of 
nothing but the idealized glory of the war that they 
were selling prospective draftees then — but if I had 
found ...” He paused, cocking his head to the side. “I

was going to say if I had found someone, but that 
won’t do. If I had found you, there isn’t a doubt in my 
mind how I would have proceeded. I was that boy, 
who would have — as soon as I discovered that you 
were what I was looking for — gotten down on one 
knee and endeavored to secure your hand. I would 
have wanted you for eternity, even when the word 
didn’t have quite the same connotations.” 

He smiled his crooked smile at me. 

I stared at him with my eyes frozen wide. 

“Breathe, Bella,” he reminded me, smiling. 

I breathed. 

“Can you see my side, Bella, even a little bit?” 

And for one second, I could. I saw myself in a long 
skirt and a high-necked lace blouse with my hair 
piled up on my head. I saw Edward looking dashing 
in a light suit with a bouquet of wildflowers in his 
hand, sitting beside me on a porch swing. 

I shook my head and swallowed. I was just having 
Anne of Green Gables flashbacks. 

“The thing is, Edward,” I said in a shaky voice, 
avoiding the question, “in my mind, marriage and 
eternity are not mutually exclusive or mutually 
inclusive concepts. And since we’re living in my world 
for the moment, maybe we should go with the times, 
if you know what I mean.” 

“But on the other hand,” he countered, “you will soon 
be leaving time behind you altogether. So why should 
the transitory customs of one local culture affect the 
decision so much?” 

296 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I pursed my lips. “When in Rome?” 

He laughed at me. “You don’t have to say yes or no 
today, Bella. It’s good to understand both sides, 
though, don’t you think?” 

“So your condition ... ?” 

“Is still in effect. I do see your point, Bella, but if you 
want me to change you myself... .” 

“Dum, dum, dah-dum,” I hummed under my breath. I 
was going for the wedding march, but it sort of 
sounded like a dirge. 

Time continued to move too fast. 

That night flew by dreamlessly, and then it was 
morning and graduation was staring me in the face. I 
had a pile of studying to do for my finals that I knew I 
wouldn’t get halfway through in the few days I had 
left. 

When I came down for breakfast, Charlie was already 
gone. He’d left the paper on the table, and that 
reminded me that I had some shopping to do. I hoped 
the ad for the concert was still running; I needed the 
phone number to get the stupid tickets. It didn’t seem 
like much of a gift now that all the surprise was gone. 
Of course, trying to surprise Alice wasn’t the brightest 
plan to begin with. 

I meant to flip right back to the entertainment 
section, but the thick black headline caught my 
attention. I felt a thrill of fear as I leaned closer to 
read the front-page story. 

SEATTLE TERRORIZED BY SLAYINGS 



297 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




It’s been less than a decade since the city of Seattle 
was the hunting ground for the most prolific serial 
killer in U.S. history. Gary Ridgway, the Green River 
Killer, was convicted of the murders of 48 women. 

And now a beleaguered Seattle must face the 
possibility that it could be harboring an even more 
horrifying monster at this very moment. 

The police are not calling the recent rash of homicides 
and disappearances the work of a serial killer. Not 
yet, at least. They are reluctant to believe so much 
carnage could be the work of one individual. This 
killer — if, in fact, it is one person — would then be 
responsible for 39 linked homicides and 
disappearances within the last three months alone. In 
comparison, Ridgway’s 48-count murder spree was 
scattered over a 21 -year period. If these deaths can be 
linked to one man, then this is the most violent 
rampage of serial murder in American history. 

The police are leaning instead toward the theory that 
gang activity is involved. This theory is supported by 
the sheer number of victims, and by the fact that 
there seems to be no pattern in the choice of victims. 

From Jack the Ripper to Ted Bundy, the targets of 
serial killings are usually connected by similarities in 
age, gender, race, or a combination of the three. The 
victims of this crime wave range in age from 15 -year- 
old honor student Amanda Reed, to 67-year-old 
retired postman Omar Jenks. The linked deaths 
include a nearly even 18 women and 21 men. The 
victims are racially diverse: Caucasians, African 
Americans, Hispanics and Asians. 

The selection appears random. The motive seems to 
be killing for no other reason than to kill. 



298 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




So why even consider the idea of a serial killer? 

There are enough similarities in the modus operandi 
to rule out unrelated crimes. Every victim discovered 
has been burned to the extent that dental records 
were necessary for identification. The use of some 
kind of accelerant, like gasoline or alcohol, seems to 
be indicated in the conflagrations; however, no traces 
of any accelerant have yet been found. All of the 
bodies have been carelessly dumped with no attempt 
at concealment. 

More gruesome yet, most of the remains show 
evidence of brutal violence — bones crushed and 
snapped by some kind of tremendous pressure — 
which medical examiners believe occurred before the 
time of death, though these conclusions are difficult 
to be sure of, considering the state of the evidence. 

Another similarity that points to the possibility of a 
serial: every crime is perfectly clean of evidence, aside 
from the remains themselves. Not a fingerprint, not a 
tire tread mark nor a foreign hair is left behind. There 
have been no sightings of any suspect in the 
disappearances . 

Then there are the disappearances themselves — 
hardly low profile by any means. None of the victims 
are what could be viewed as easy targets. None are 
runaways or the homeless, who vanish so easily and 
are seldom reported missing. Victims have vanished 
from their homes, from a fourth-story apartment, 
from a health club, from a wedding reception. 

Perhaps the most astounding: 30-year-old amateur 
boxer Robert Walsh entered a movie theater with a 
date; a few minutes into the movie, the woman 
realized that he was not in his seat. His body was 
found only three hours later when fire fighters were 



299 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




called to the scene of a burning trash Dumpster, 
twenty miles away. 

Another pattern is present in the slayings: all of the 
victims disappeared at night. 

And the most alarming pattern? Acceleration. Six of 
the homicides were committed in the first month, 1 1 
in the second. Twenty-two have occurred in the last 
10 days alone. And the police are no closer to finding 
the responsible party than they were after the first 
charred body was discovered. 

The evidence is conflicting, the pieces horrifying. A 
vicious new gang or a wildly active serial killer? Or 
something else the police haven’t yet conceived of? 

Only one conclusion is indisputable: something 
hideous is stalking Seattle. 

It took me three tries to read the last sentence, and I 
realized the problem was my shaking hands. 

“Bella?” 

Focused as I was, Edward’s voice, though quiet and 
not totally unexpected, made me gasp and whirl. 

He was leaning in the doorway, his eyebrows pulled 
together. Then he was suddenly at my side, taking my 
hand. 

“Did I startle you? I’m sorry. I did knock... .” 

“No, no,” I said quickly. “Have you seen this?” I 
pointed to the paper. 

A frown creased his forehead. 



300 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I hadn’t seen today’s news yet. But I knew it was 
getting worse. We’re going to have to do something ... 
quickly.” 

I didn’t like that. I hated any of them taking chances, 
and whatever or whoever was in Seattle was truly 
beginning to frighten me. But the idea of the Volturi 
coming was just as scary. 

“What does Alice say?” 

“That’s the problem.” His frown hardened. “She can’t 
see anything ... though we’ve made up our minds half 
a dozen times to check it out. She’s starting to lose 
confidence. She feels like she’s missing too much 
these days, that something’s wrong. That maybe her 
vision is slipping away.” 

My eyes were wide. “Can that happen?” 

“Who knows? No one’s ever done a study ... but I 
really doubt it. These things tend to intensify over 
time. Look at Aro and Jane.” 

“Then what’s wrong?” 

“Self-fulfilling prophecy, I think. We keep waiting for 
Alice to see something so we can go ... and she 
doesn’t see anything because we won’t really go until 
she does. So she can’t see us there. Maybe we’ll have 
to do it blind.” 

I shuddered. “No.” 

“Did you have a strong desire to attend class today? 
We’re only a couple of days from finals; they won’t be 
giving us anything new.” 



301 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I think I can live without school for a day. What are 
we doing?” 

“I want to talk to Jasper.” 

Jasper, again. It was strange. In the Cullen family, 
Jasper was always a little on the fringe, part of things 
but never the center of them. It was my unspoken 
assumption that he was only there for Alice. I had the 
sense that he would follow Alice anywhere, but that 
this lifestyle was not his first choice. The fact that he 
was less committed to it than the others was probably 
why he had more difficulty keeping it up. 

At any rate, I’d never seen Edward feel dependent on 
Jasper. I wondered again what he’d meant about 
Jasper’s expertise. I really didn’t know much about 
Jasper’s history, just that he had come from 
somewhere in the south before Alice found him. For 
some reason, Edward had always shied away from 
any questions about his newest brother. And I’d 
always been too intimidated by the tall, blond vampire 
who looked like a brooding movie star to ask him 
outright. 

When we got to the house, we found Carlisle, Esme, 
and Jasper watching the news intently, though the 
sound was so low that it was unintelligible to me. 

Alice was perched on the bottom step of the grand 
staircase, her face in her hands and her expression 
discouraged. As we walked in, Emmett ambled 
through the kitchen door, seeming perfectly at ease. 
Nothing ever bothered Emmett. 

“Hey, Edward. Ditching, Bella?” He grinned at me. 

“We both are,” Edward reminded him. 



302 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Emmett laughed. “Yes, but it’s her first time through 
high school. She might miss something.” 

Edward rolled his eyes, but otherwise ignored his 
favorite brother. He tossed the paper to Carlisle. 

“Did you see that they’re considering a serial killer 
now?” he asked. 

Carlisle sighed. “They’ve had two specialists debating 
that possibility on CNN all morning.” 

“We can’t let this go on.” 

“Let’s go now,” Emmett said with sudden enthusiasm. 
“I’m dead bored.” 

A hiss echoed down the stairway from upstairs. 

“She’s such a pessimist,” Emmett muttered to 
himself. 

Edward agreed with Emmett. “We’ll have to go 
sometime.” 

Rosalie appeared at the top of the stairs and 
descended slowly. Her face was smooth, 
expressionless. 

Carlisle was shaking his head. “I’m concerned. We’ve 
never involved ourselves in this kind of thing before. 
It’s not our business. We aren’t the Volturi.” 

“I don’t want the Volturi to have to come here,” 
Edward said. “It gives us so much less reaction time.” 

“And all those innocent humans in Seattle,” Esme 
murmured. “It’s not right to let them die this way.” 



303 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I know,” Carlisle sighed. 

“Oh,” Edward said sharply, turning his head slightly 
to look at Jasper. “I didn’t think of that. I see. You’re 
right, that has to be it. Well, that changes everything.” 

I wasn’t the only one who stared at him in confusion, 
but I might have been the only one who didn’t look 
slightly annoyed. 

“I think you’d better explain to the others,” Edward 
said to Jasper. “What could be the purpose of this?” 
Edward started to pace, staring at the floor, lost in 
thought. 

I hadn’t seen her get up, but Alice was there beside 
me. “What is he rambling about?” she asked Jasper. 
“What are you thinking?” 

Jasper didn’t seem to enjoy the spotlight. He 
hesitated, reading every face in the circle — for 
everyone had moved in to hear what he would say — 
and then his eyes paused on my face. 

“You’re confused,” he said to me, his deep voice very 
quiet. 

There was no question in his assumption. Jasper 
knew what I was feeling, what everyone was feeling. 

“We’re all confused,” Emmett grumbled. 

“You can afford the time to be patient,” Jasper told 
him. “Bella should understand this, too. She’s one of 
us now.” 

His words took me by surprise. As little as I’d had to 
do with Jasper, especially since my last birthday 



304 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




when he’d tried to kill me, I hadn’t realize that he 
thought of me that way. 



“How much do you know about me, Bella?” Jasper 
asked. 

Emmett sighed theatrically, and plopped down on the 
couch to wait with exaggerated impatience. 

“Not much,” I admitted. 

Jasper stared at Edward, who looked up to meet his 
gaze. 

“No,” Edward answered his thought. “I’m sure you 
can understand why I haven’t told her that story. But 
I suppose she needs to hear it now.” 

Jasper nodded thoughtfully, and then started to roll 
up the arm of his ivory sweater. 

I watched, curious and confused, trying to figure out 
what he was doing. He held his wrist under the edge 
of the lampshade beside him, close to the light of the 
naked bulb, and traced his finger across a raised 
crescent mark on the pale skin. 

It took me a minute to understand why the shape 
looked strangely familiar. 

“Oh,” I breathed as realization hit. “Jasper, you have 
a scar exactly like mine.” 

I held out my hand, the silvery crescent more 
prominent against my cream skin than against his 
alabaster. 

Jasper smiled faintly. “I have a lot of scars like yours, 
Bella.” 

305 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jasper’s face was unreadable as he pushed the sleeve 
of his thin sweater higher up his arm. At first my eyes 
could not make sense of the texture that was layered 
thickly across the skin. Curved half-moons 
crisscrossed in a feathery pattern that was only 
visible, white on white as it was, because the bright 
glow of the lamp beside him threw the slightly raised 
design into relief, with shallow shadows outlining the 
shapes. And then I grasped that the pattern was 
made of individual crescents like the one on his wrist 
... the one on my hand. 

I looked back at my own small, solitary scar — and 
remembered how I’d received it. I stared at the shape 
of James’s teeth, embossed forever on my skin. 

And then I gasped, staring up at him. “Jasper, what 
happened to you?” 



306 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 





“The same thing that happened to your hand,” Jasper 
answered in a quiet voice. “Repeated a thousand 
times.” He laughed a little ruefully and brushed at his 
arm. “Our venom is the only thing that leaves a scar.” 

“Why?” I breathed in horror, feeling rude but unable 
to stop staring at his subtly ravaged skin. 

“I didn’t have quite the same ... upbringing as my 
adopted siblings here. My beginning was something 
else entirely.” His voice turned hard as he finished. 

I gaped at him, appalled. 

“Before I tell you my story,” Jasper said, “you must 
understand that there are places in our world, Bella, 
where the life span of the never-aging is measured in 
weeks, and not centuries.” 

The others had heard this before. Carlisle and 
Emmett turned their attention to the TV again. Alice 
moved silently to sit at Esme’s feet. But Edward was 
just as absorbed as I was; I could feel his eyes on my 
face, reading every flicker of emotion. 

“To really understand why, you have to look at the 
world from a different perspective. You have to 
imagine the way it looks to the powerful, the greedy ... 
the perpetually thirsty. 

“You see, there are places in this world that are more 
desirable to us than others. Places where we can be 
less restrained, and still avoid detection.

“Picture, for instance, a map of the western 
hemisphere. Picture on it every human life as a small 
red dot. The thicker the red, the more easily we — 
well, those who exist this way — can feed without 
attracting notice.” 

I shuddered at the image in my head, at the word 
feed. But Jasper wasn’t worried about frightening me, 
not overprotective like Edward always was. He went 
on without a pause. 

“Not that the covens in the South care much for what 
the humans notice or do not. It’s the Volturi that keep 
them in check. They are the only ones the southern 
covens fear. If not for the Volturi, the rest of us would 
be quickly exposed.” 

I frowned at the way he pronounced the name — with 
respect, almost gratitude. The idea of the Volturi as 
the good guys in any sense was hard to accept. 

“The North is, by comparison, very civilized. Mostly 
we are nomads here who enjoy the day as well as the 
night, who allow humans to interact with us 
unsuspectingly — anonymity is important to us all. 

“It’s a different world in the South. The immortals 
there come out only at night. They spend the day 
plotting their next move, or anticipating their 
enemy’s. Because it has been war in the South, 
constant war for centuries, with never one moment of 
truce. The covens there barely note the existence of 
humans, except as soldiers notice a herd of cows by 
the wayside — food for the taking. They only hide 
from the notice of the herd because of the Volturi.” 

“But what are they fighting for?” I asked. 



308 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jasper smiled. “Remember the map with the red 
dots?” 



He waited, so I nodded. 

“They fight for control of the thickest red. 

“You see, it occurred to someone once that, if he were 
the only vampire in, let’s say Mexico City, well then, 
he could feed every night, twice, three times, and no 
one would ever notice. He plotted ways to get rid of 
the competition. 

“Others had the same idea. Some came up with more 
effective tactics than others. 

“But the most effective tactic was invented by a fairly 
young vampire named Benito. The first anyone ever 
heard of him, he came down from somewhere north of 
Dallas and massacred the two small covens that 
shared the area near Houston. Two nights later, he 
took on the much stronger clan of allies that claimed 
Monterrey in northern Mexico. Again, he won.” 

“How did he win?” I asked with wary curiosity. 

“Benito had created an army of newborn vampires. He 
was the first one to think of it, and, in the beginning, 
he was unstoppable. Very young vampires are 
volatile, wild, and almost impossible to control. One 
newborn can be reasoned with, taught to restrain 
himself, but ten, fifteen together are a nightmare. 
They’ll turn on each other as easily as on the enemy 
you point them at. Benito had to keep making more 
as they fought amongst themselves, and as the 
covens he decimated took more than half his force 
down before they lost.

“You see, though newborns are dangerous, they are 
still possible to defeat if you know what you’re doing. 
They’re incredibly powerful physically, for the first 
year or so, and if they’re allowed to bring strength to 
bear they can crush an older vampire with ease. But 
they are slaves to their instincts, and thus 
predictable. Usually, they have no skill in fighting, 
only muscle and ferocity. And in this case, 
overwhelming numbers.” 

“The vampires in southern Mexico realized what was 
coming for them, and they did the only thing they 
could think of to counteract Benito. They made 
armies of their own... . 

“All hell broke loose — and I mean that more literally 
than you can possibly imagine. We immortals have 
our histories, too, and this particular war will never 
be forgotten. Of course, it was not a good time to be 
human in Mexico, either.” 

I shuddered. 

“When the body count reached epidemic proportions 
— in fact, your histories blame a disease for the 
population slump — the Volturi finally stepped in. 
The entire guard came together and sought out every 
newborn in the bottom half of North America. Benito 
was entrenched in Puebla, building his army as 
quickly as he could in order to take on the prize — 
Mexico City. The Volturi started with him, and then 
moved on to the rest. 

“Anyone who was found with the newborns was 
executed immediately, and, since everyone was trying 
to protect themselves from Benito, Mexico was 
emptied of vampires for a time.

“The Volturi were cleaning house for almost a year. 
This was another chapter of our history that will 
always be remembered, though there were very few 
witnesses left to speak of what it was like. I spoke to 
someone once who had, from a distance, watched 
what happened when they visited Culiacan.” 

Jasper shuddered. I realized that I had never before 
seen him either afraid or horrified. This was a first. 

“It was enough that the fever for conquest did not 
spread from the South. The rest of the world stayed 
sane. We owe the Volturi for our present way of life. 

“But when the Volturi went back to Italy, the 
survivors were quick to stake their claims in the 
South. 

“It didn’t take long before covens began to dispute 
again. There was a lot of bad blood, if you’ll forgive 
the expression. Vendettas abounded. The idea of 
newborns was already there, and some were not able 
to resist. However, the Volturi had not been forgotten, 
and the southern covens were more careful this time. 
The newborns were selected from the human pool 
with more care, and given more training. They were 
used circumspectly, and the humans remained, for 
the most part, oblivious. Their creators gave the 
Volturi no reason to return. 

“The wars resumed, but on a smaller scale. Every now 
and then, someone would go too far, speculation 
would begin in the human newspapers, and the 
Volturi would return and clean out the city. But they 
let the others, the careful ones, continue... .” 

Jasper was staring off into space.

“That’s how you were changed.” My realization was a 
whisper. 



“Yes,” he agreed. “When I was human, I lived in 
Houston, Texas. I was almost seventeen years old 
when I joined the Confederate Army in 1861. I lied to 
the recruiters and told them I was twenty. I was tall 
enough to get away with it. 

“My military career was short-lived, but very 
promising. People always ... liked me, listened to what 
I had to say. My father said it was charisma. Of 
course, now I know it was probably something more. 
But, whatever the reason, I was promoted quickly 
through the ranks, over older, more experienced men. 
The Confederate Army was new and scrambling to 
organize itself, so that provided opportunities, as well. 
By the first battle of Galveston — well, it was more of 
a skirmish, really — I was the youngest major in 
Texas, not even acknowledging my real age. 

“I was placed in charge of evacuating the women and 
children from the city when the Union’s mortar boats 
reached the harbor. It took a day to prepare them, 
and then I left with the first column of civilians to 
convey them to Houston. 

“I remember that one night very clearly. 

“We reached the city after dark. I stayed only long 
enough to make sure the entire party was safely 
situated. As soon as that was done, I got myself a 
fresh horse, and I headed back to Galveston. There 
wasn’t time to rest. 

“Just a mile outside the city, I found three women on 
foot. I assumed they were stragglers and dismounted 
at once to offer them my aid. But, when I could see 
their faces in the dim light of the moon, I was 

312 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




stunned into silence. They were, without question, 
the three most beautiful women I had ever seen. 

“They had such pale skin, I remember marveling at it. 
Even the little black-haired girl, whose features were 
clearly Mexican, was porcelain in the moonlight. They 
seemed young, all of them, still young enough to be 
called girls. I knew they were not lost members of our 
party. I would have remembered seeing these three. 

‘“He’s speechless,’ the tallest girl said in a lovely, 
delicate voice — it was like wind chimes. She had fair 
hair, and her skin was snow white. 

“The other was blonder still, her skin just as chalky. 
Her face was like an angel’s. She leaned toward me 
with half-closed eyes and inhaled deeply. 

“‘Mmm,’ she sighed. ‘Lovely.’ 

“The small one, the tiny brunette, put her hand on 
the girl’s arm and spoke quickly. Her voice was too 
soft and musical to be sharp, but that seemed to be 
the way she intended it. 

“‘Concentrate, Nettie,’ she said. 

“I’d always had a good sense of how people related to 
each other, and it was immediately clear that the 
brunette was somehow in charge of the others. If 
they’d been military, I would have said that she 
outranked them. 

‘“He looks right — young, strong, an officer... . ’ The 
brunette paused, and I tried unsuccessfully to speak. 
‘And there’s something more ... do you sense it?’ she 
asked the other two. ‘He’s ... compelling.’ 



313 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“‘Oh, yes,’ Nettie quickly agreed, leaning toward me 
again. 

“Patience,’ the brunette cautioned her. ‘I want to keep 
this one.’ 

“Nettie frowned; she seemed annoyed. 

“You’d better do it, Maria,’ the taller blonde spoke 
again. ‘If he’s important to you. I kill them twice as 
often as I keep them.’ 

“Yes, I’ll do it,’ Maria agreed. ‘I really do like this one. 
Take Nettie away, will you? I don’t want to have to 
protect my back while I’m trying to focus.’ 

“My hair was standing up on the back of my neck, 
though I didn’t understand the meaning of anything 
the beautiful creatures were saying. My instincts told 
me that there was danger, that the angel had meant it 
when she spoke of killing, but my judgment overruled 
my instincts. I had not been taught to fear women, 
but to protect them. 

“‘Let’s hunt,’ Nettie agreed enthusiastically, reaching 
for the tall girl’s hand. They wheeled — they were so 
graceful! — and sprinted toward the city. They 
seemed to almost take flight, they were so fast — their 
white dresses blew out behind them like wings. I 
blinked in amazement, and they were gone. 

“I turned to stare at Maria, who was watching me 
curiously. 

“I’d never been superstitious in my life. Until that 
second, I’d never believed in ghosts or any other such 
nonsense. Suddenly, I was unsure. 

‘“What is your name, soldier?’ Maria asked me. 

314 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“‘Major Jasper Whitlock, ma’am,’ I stammered, unable 
to be impolite to a female, even if she was a ghost. 

“‘I truly hope you survive, Jasper,’ she said in her 
gentle voice. ‘I have a good feeling about you.’ 

“She took a step closer, and inclined her head as if 
she were going to kiss me. I stood frozen in place, 
though my instincts were screaming at me to run.” 

Jasper paused, his face thoughtful. “A few days later,” 
he finally said, and I wasn’t sure if he had edited his 
story for my sake or because he was responding to 
the tension that even I could feel exuding from 
Edward, “I was introduced to my new life. 

“Their names were Maria, Nettie, and Lucy. They 
hadn’t been together long — Maria had rounded up 
the other two — all three were survivors of recently 
lost battles. Theirs was a partnership of convenience. 
Maria wanted revenge, and she wanted her territories 
back. The others were eager to increase their . . . herd 
lands, I suppose you could say. They were putting 
together an army, and going about it more carefully 
than was usual. It was Maria’s idea. She wanted a 
superior army, so she sought out specific humans 
who had potential. Then she gave us much more 
attention, more training than anyone else had 
bothered with. She taught us to fight, and she taught 
us to be invisible to the humans. When we did well, 
we were rewarded... .” 

He paused, editing again. 

“She was in a hurry, though. Maria knew that the 
massive strength of the newborn began to wane 
around the year mark, and she wanted to act while 
we were strong. 



315 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“There were six of us when I joined Maria’s band. She 
added four more within a fortnight. We were all male 
— Maria wanted soldiers — and that made it slightly 
more difficult to keep from fighting amongst 
ourselves. I fought my first battles against my new 
comrades in arms. I was quicker than the others, 
better at combat. Maria was pleased with me, though 
put out that she had to keep replacing the ones I 
destroyed. I was rewarded often, and that made me 
stronger. 

“Maria was a good judge of character. She decided to 
put me in charge of the others — as if I were being 
promoted. It suited my nature exactly. The casualties 
went down dramatically, and our numbers swelled to 
hover around twenty. 

“This was considerable for the cautious times we lived 
in. My ability, as yet undefined, to control the 
emotional atmosphere around me was vitally effective. 
We soon began to work together in a way that 
newborn vampires had never cooperated before. Even 
Maria, Nettie, and Lucy were able to work together 
more easily. 

“Maria grew quite fond of me — she began to depend 
upon me. And, in some ways, I worshipped the 
ground she walked on. I had no idea that any other 
life was possible. Maria told us this was the way 
things were, and we believed. 

“She asked me to tell her when my brothers and I 
were ready to fight, and I was eager to prove myself. I 
pulled together an army of twenty-three in the end — 
twenty-three unbelievably strong new vampires, 
organized and skilled as no others before. Maria was 
ecstatic. 



316 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“We crept down toward Monterrey, her former home, 
and she unleashed us on her enemies. They had only 
nine newborns at the time, and a pair of older 
vampires controlling them. We took them down more 
easily than Maria could believe, losing only four in the 
process. It was an unheard-of margin of victory. 

“And we were well trained. We did it without 
attracting notice. The city changed hands without any 
human being aware. 

“Success made Maria greedy. It wasn’t long before she 
began to eye other cities. That first year, she extended 
her control to cover most of Texas and northern 
Mexico. Then the others came from the South to 
dislodge her.” 

He brushed two fingers along the faint pattern of 
scars on his arm. 

“The fighting was intense. Many began to worry that 
the Volturi would return. Of the original twenty-three, 
I was the only one to survive the first eighteen 
months. We both won and lost. Nettie and Lucy 
turned on Maria eventually — but that one we won. 

“Maria and I were able to hold on to Monterrey. It 
quieted a little, though the wars continued. The idea 
of conquest was dying out; it was mostly vengeance 
and feuding now. So many had lost their partners, 
and that is something our kind does not forgive... . 

“Maria and I always kept a dozen or so newborns 
ready. They meant little to us — they were pawns, 
they were disposable. When they outgrew their 
usefulness, we did dispose of them. My life continued 
in the same violent pattern and the years passed. I 
was sick of it all for a very long time before anything 
changed ... 

317 | P a g e

“Decades later, I developed a friendship with a 
newborn who’d remained useful and survived his first 
three years, against the odds. His name was Peter. I 
liked Peter; he was ... civilized — I suppose that’s the 
right word. He didn’t enjoy the fight, though he was 
good at it. 

“He was assigned to deal with the newborns — 
babysit them, you could say. It was a full-time job. 

“And then it was time to purge again. The newborns 
were outgrowing their strength; they were due to be 
replaced. Peter was supposed to help me dispose of 
them. We took them aside individually, you see, one 
by one ... It was always a very long night. This time, 
he tried to convince me that a few had potential, but 
Maria had instructed that we get rid of them all. I told 
him no. 

“We were about halfway through, and I could feel that 
it was taking a great toll on Peter. I was trying to 
decide whether or not I should send him away and 
finish up myself as I called out the next victim. To my 
surprise, he was suddenly angry, furious. I braced for 
whatever his mood might foreshadow — he was a 
good fighter, but he was never a match for me. 

“The newborn I’d summoned was a female, just past 
her year mark. Her name was Charlotte. His feelings 
changed when she came into view; they gave him 
away. He yelled for her to run, and he bolted after 
her. I could have pursued them, but I didn’t. I felt ... 
averse to destroying him. 

“Maria was irritated with me for that . . . 

“Five years later, Peter snuck back for me. He picked 
a good day to arrive. 



318 | P a g e

“Maria was mystified by my ever-deteriorating frame 
of mind. She’d never felt a moment’s depression, and 
I wondered why I was different. I began to notice a 
change in her emotions when she was near me — 
sometimes there was fear . . . and malice — the same 
feelings that had given me advance warning when 
Nettie and Lucy struck. I was preparing myself to 
destroy my only ally, the core of my existence, when 
Peter returned. 

“Peter told me about his new life with Charlotte, told 
me about options I’d never dreamed I had. In five 
years, they’d never had a fight, though they’d met 
many others in the north. Others who could co-exist 
without the constant mayhem. 

“In one conversation, he had me convinced. I was 
ready to go, and somewhat relieved I wouldn’t have to 
kill Maria. I’d been her companion for as many years 
as Carlisle and Edward have been together, yet the 
bond between us was nowhere near as strong. When 
you live for the fight, for the blood, the relationships 
you form are tenuous and easily broken. I walked 
away without a backward glance. 

“I traveled with Peter and Charlotte for a few years, 
getting the feel of this new, more peaceful world. But 
the depression didn’t fade. I didn’t understand what 
was wrong with me, until Peter noticed that it was 
always worse after I’d hunted. 

“I contemplated that. In so many years of slaughter 
and carnage, I’d lost nearly all of my humanity. I was 
undeniably a nightmare, a monster of the grisliest 
kind. Yet each time I found another human victim, I 
would feel a faint prick of remembrance for that other 
life. Watching their eyes widen in wonder at my 
beauty, I could see Maria and the others in my head, 
what they had looked like to me the last night that I

was Jasper Whitlock. It was stronger for me — this 
borrowed memory — than it was for anyone else, 
because I could feel everything my prey was feeling. 
And I lived their emotions as I killed them. 

“You’ve experienced the way I can manipulate the 
emotions around myself, Bella, but I wonder if you 
realize how the feelings in a room affect me. I live 
every day in a climate of emotion. For the first 
century of my life, I lived in a world of bloodthirsty 
vengeance. Hate was my constant companion. It 
eased some when I left Maria, but I still had to feel 
the horror and fear of my prey. 

“It began to be too much. 

“The depression got worse, and I wandered away from 
Peter and Charlotte. Civilized as they were, they didn’t 
feel the same aversion I was beginning to feel. They 
only wanted peace from the fight. I was so wearied by 
killing — killing anyone, even mere humans. 

“Yet I had to keep killing. What choice did I have? I 
tried to kill less often, but I would get too thirsty and I 
would give in. After a century of instant gratification, I 
found self-discipline ... challenging. I still haven’t 
perfected that.” 

Jasper was lost in the story, as was I. It surprised me 
when his desolate expression smoothed into a 
peaceful smile. 

“I was in Philadelphia. There was a storm, and I was 
out during the day — something I was not completely 
comfortable with yet. I knew standing in the rain 
would attract attention, so I ducked into a little half- 
empty diner. My eyes were dark enough that no one 
would notice them, though this meant I was thirsty, 
and that worried me a little.

“She was there — expecting me, naturally.” He 
chuckled once. “She hopped down from the high stool 
at the counter as soon as I walked in and came 
directly toward me. 

“It shocked me. I was not sure if she meant to attack. 
That’s the only interpretation of her behavior my past 
had to offer. But she was smiling. And the emotions 
that were emanating from her were like nothing I’d 
ever felt before. 

“You’ve kept me waiting a long time,’ she said.” 

I didn’t realize Alice had come to stand behind me 
again. 

“And you ducked your head, like a good Southern 
gentleman, and said, ‘I’m sorry, ma’am.’” Alice 
laughed at the memory. 

Jasper smiled down at her. “You held out your hand, 
and I took it without stopping to make sense of what I 
was doing. For the first time in almost a century, I felt 
hope.” 

Jasper took Alice’s hand as he spoke. 

Alice grinned. “I was just relieved. I thought you were 
never going to show up.” 

They smiled at each other for a long moment, and 
then Jasper looked back to me, the soft expression 
lingering. 

“Alice told me what she’d seen of Carlisle and his 
family. I could hardly believe that such an existence 
was possible. But Alice made me optimistic. So we 
went to find them.” 



321 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Scared the hell out of them, too,” Edward said, 
rolling his eyes at Jasper before turning to me to 
explain. “Emmett and I were away hunting. Jasper 
shows up, covered in battle scars, towing this little 
freak” — he nudged Alice playfully — “who greets 
them all by name, knows everything about them, and 
wants to know which room she can move into.” 

Alice and Jasper laughed in harmony, soprano and 
bass. 

“When I got home, all my things were in the garage,” 
Edward continued. 

Alice shrugged. “Your room had the best view.” 

They all laughed together now. 

“That’s a nice story,” I said. 

Three pairs of eyes questioned my sanity. 

“I mean the last part,” I defended myself. “The happy 
ending with Alice.” 

“Alice has made all the difference,” Jasper agreed. 
“This is a climate I enjoy.” 

But the momentary pause in the stress couldn’t last. 

“An army,” Alice whispered. “Why didn’t you tell me?” 

The others were intent again, their eyes locked on 
Jasper’s face. 

“I thought I must be interpreting the signs incorrectly. 
Because where is the motive? Why would someone 
create an army in Seattle? There is no history there, 
no vendetta. It makes no sense from a conquest 

322 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




standpoint, either; no one claims it. Nomads pass 
through, but there’s no one to fight for it. No one to 
defend it from. 

“But I’ve seen this before, and there’s no other 
explanation. There is an army of newborn vampires in 
Seattle. Fewer than twenty, I’d guess. The difficult 
part is that they are totally untrained. Whoever made 
them just set them loose. It will only get worse, and it 
won’t be much longer till the Volturi step in. Actually, 
I’m surprised they’ve let this go on so long.” 

“What can we do?” Carlisle asked. 

“If we want to avoid the Volturi’s involvement, we will 
have to destroy the newborns, and we will have to do 
it very soon.” Jasper’s face was hard. Knowing his 
story now, I could guess how this evaluation must 
disturb him. “I can teach you how. It won’t be easy in 
the city. The young ones aren’t concerned about 
secrecy, but we will have to be. It will limit us in ways 
that they are not. Maybe we can lure them out.” 

“Maybe we won’t have to.” Edward’s voice was bleak. 
“Does it occur to anyone else that the only possible 
threat in the area that would call for the creation of 
an army is ... us?” 

Jasper’s eyes narrowed; Carlisle’s widened, shocked. 

“Tanya’s family is also near,” Esme said slowly, 
unwilling to accept Edward’s words. 

“The newborns aren’t ravaging Anchorage, Esme. I 
think we have to consider the idea that we are the 
targets.” 



323 | P a g e

“They’re not coming after us,” Alice insisted, and then 
paused. “Or ... they don’t know that they are. Not 
yet.” 

“What is that?” Edward asked, curious and tense. 
“What are you remembering?” 

“Flickers,” Alice said. “I can’t see a clear picture when 
I try to see what’s going on, nothing concrete. But I’ve 
been getting these strange flashes. Not enough to 
make sense of. It’s as if someone’s changing their 
mind, moving from one course of action to another so 
quickly that I can’t get a good view... .” 

“Indecision?” Jasper asked in disbelief. 

“I don’t know... .” 

“Not indecision,” Edward growled. “Knowledge. 
Someone who knows you can’t see anything until the 
decision is made. Someone who is hiding from us. 
Playing with the holes in your vision.” 

“Who would know that?” Alice whispered. 

Edward’s eyes were hard as ice. “Aro knows you as 
well as you know yourself.” 

“But I would see if they’d decided to come... .” 

“Unless they didn’t want to get their hands dirty.” 

“A favor,” Rosalie suggested, speaking for the first 
time. “Someone in the South ... someone who already 
had trouble with the rules. Someone who should have 
been destroyed is offered a second chance — if they 
take care of this one small problem... . That would 
explain the Volturi’s sluggish response.” 



324 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Why?” Carlisle asked, still shocked. “There’s no 
reason for the Volturi — ” 

“It was there,” Edward disagreed quietly. “I’m 
surprised it’s come to this so soon, because the other 
thoughts were stronger. In Aro’s head he saw me at 
his one side and Alice at his other. The present and 
the future, virtual omniscience. The power of the idea 
intoxicated him. I would have thought it would take 
him much longer to give up on that plan — he wanted 
it too much. But there was also the thought of you, 
Carlisle, of our family, growing stronger and larger. 
The jealousy and the fear: you having ... not more 
than he had, but still, things that he wanted. He tried 
not to think about it, but he couldn’t hide it 
completely. The idea of rooting out the competition 
was there; besides their own, ours is the largest coven 
they’ve ever found... .” 

I stared at his face in horror. He’d never told me this, 
but I guessed I knew why. I could see it in my head 
now, Aro’s dream. Edward and Alice in black, flowing 
robes, drifting along at Aro’s side with their eyes cold 
and blood-red... . 

Carlisle interrupted my waking nightmare. “They’re 
too committed to their mission. They would never 
break the rules themselves. It goes against everything 
they’ve worked for.” 

“They’ll clean up afterward. A double betrayal,” 
Edward said in a grim voice. “No harm done.” 

Jasper leaned forward, shaking his head. “No, Carlisle 
is right. The Volturi do not break rules. Besides, it’s 
much too sloppy. This ... person, this threat — they 
have no idea what they’re doing. A first-timer, I’d 
swear to it. I cannot believe the Volturi are involved. 
But they will be.” 

325 | P a g e

They all stared at each other, frozen with stress. 

“Then let’s go,” Emmett almost roared. “What are we 
waiting for?” 

Carlisle and Edward exchanged a long glance. 

Edward nodded once. 

“Well need you to teach us, Jasper,” Carlisle finally 
said. “How to destroy them.” Carlisle’s jaw was hard, 
but I could see the pain in his eyes as he said the 
words. No one hated violence more than Carlisle. 

There was something bothering me, and I couldn’t put 
my finger on it. I was numb, horrified, deathly afraid. 
And yet, under that, I could feel that I was missing 
something important. Something that would make 
some sense out of the chaos. That would explain it. 

“We’re going to need help,” Jasper said. “Do you think 
Tanya’s family would be willing ... ? Another five 
mature vampires would make an enormous 
difference. And then Kate and Eleazar would be 
especially advantageous on our side. It would be 
almost easy, with their aid.” 

“Well ask,” Carlisle answered. 

Jasper held out a cell phone. “We need to hurry.” 

I’d never seen Carlisle’s innate calm so shaken. He 
took the phone, and paced toward the windows. He 
dialed a number, held the phone to his ear, and laid 
the other hand against the glass. He stared out into 
the foggy morning with a pained and ambivalent 
expression. 



326 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Edward took my hand and pulled me to the white 
loveseat. I sat beside him, staring at his face while he 
stared at Carlisle. 



Carlisle’s voice was low and quick, difficult to hear. I 
heard him greet Tanya, and then he raced through 
the situation too fast for me to understand much, 
though I could tell that the Alaskan vampires were 
not ignorant of what was going on in Seattle. 

Then something changed in Carlisle’s voice. 

“Oh,” he said, his voice sharper in surprise. “We 
didn’t realize ... that Irina felt that way.” 

Edward groaned at my side and closed his eyes. 
“Damn it. Damn Laurent to the deepest pit of hell 
where he belongs.” 

“Laurent?” I whispered, the blood emptying from my 
face, but Edward didn’t respond, focused on Carlisle’s 
thoughts. 

My short encounter with Laurent early this spring 
was not something that had faded or dimmed in my 
mind. I still remembered every word he’d said before 
Jacob and his pack had interrupted. 

I actually came here as a favor to her. . . . 

Victoria. Laurent had been her first maneuver — 
she’d sent him to observe, to see how hard it might be 
to get to me. He hadn’t survived the wolves to report 
back. 

Though he’d kept up his old ties with Victoria after 
James’s death, he’d also formed new ties and new 
relationships. He’d gone to live with Tanya’s family in 
Alaska — Tanya the strawberry blonde — the closest 

327 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




friends the Cullens had in the vampire world, 
practically extended family. Laurent had been with 
them for almost a year previous to his death. 

Carlisle was still talking, his voice not quite pleading. 
Persuasive, but with an edge. Then the edge abruptly 
won out over the persuasion. 

“There’s no question of that,” Carlisle said in a stern 
voice. “We have a truce. They haven’t broken it, and 
neither will we. I’m sorry to hear that... . Of course. 
Well just have to do our best alone.” 

Carlisle shut the phone without waiting for an 
answer. He continued to stare out into the fog. 

“What’s the problem?” Emmett murmured to Edward. 

“Irina was more involved with our friend Laurent than 
we knew. She’s holding a grudge against the wolves 
for destroying him to save Bella. She wants — ” He 
paused, looking down at me. 

“Go on,” I said as evenly as I could. 

His eyes tightened. “She wants revenge. To take down 
the pack. They would trade their help for our 
permission.” 

“No!” I gasped. 

“Don’t worry,” he told me in a flat voice. “Carlisle 
would never agree to it.” He hesitated, then sighed. 
“Nor would I. Laurent had it coming” — this was 
almost a growl — “and I still owe the wolves for that.” 

“This isn’t good,” Jasper said. “It’s too even a fight. 
We’d have the upper hand in skill, but not numbers.

We’d win, but at what price?” His tense eyes flashed 
to Alice’s face and away. 

I wanted to scream out loud as I grasped what Jasper 
meant. 

We would win, but we would lose. Some wouldn’t 
survive. 

I looked around the room at their faces — Jasper, 
Alice, Emmett, Rose, Esme, Carlisle ... Edward — the 
faces of my family.

DECLARATION 




“You can't be serious,” I said Wednesday afternoon. 
“You’ve completely lost your mind!” 

“Say whatever you like about me,” Alice answered. 
“The party is still on.” 

I stared at her, my eyes so wide with disbelief it felt 
like they might fall out and land on my lunch tray. 

“Oh, calm down, Bella! There’s no reason not to go 
through with it. Besides, the invitations are already 
sent.” 

“But ... the ... you ... I ... insane!” I spluttered. 

“You’ve already bought my present,” she reminded 
me. “You don’t have to do anything but show up.” 

I made an effort to calm myself. “With everything that 
is going on right now, a party is hardly appropriate.” 

“Graduation is what’s going on right now, and a party 
is so appropriate it’s almost passe.” 

“Alice!” 

She sighed, and tried to be serious. “There are a few 
things we need to get in order now, and that’s going 
to take a little time. As long as we’re sitting here 
waiting, we might as well commemorate the good 
stuff. You’re only going to graduate from high school 
— for the first time — once. You don’t get to be 
human again, Bella. This is a once-in-a-lifetime shot.”

Edward, silent through our little argument, flashed 
her a warning look. She stuck out her tongue at him. 
She was right — her soft voice would never carry over 
the babble of the cafeteria. And no one would 
understand the meaning behind her words in any 
case. 

“What few things do we need to get in order?” I asked, 
refusing to be sidetracked. 

Edward answered in a low voice. “Jasper thinks we 
could use some help. Tanya’s family isn’t the only 
choice we have. Carlisle’s trying to track down a few 
old friends, and Jasper is looking up Peter and 
Charlotte. He’s considering talking to Maria ... but no 
one really wants to involve the southerners.” 

Alice shuddered delicately. 

“It shouldn’t be too hard to convince them to help,” he 
continued. “Nobody wants a visit from Italy.” 

“But these friends — they’re not going to be . . . 
vegetarians, right?” I protested, using the Cullens’ 
tongue-in-cheek nickname for themselves. 

“No,” Edward answered, suddenly expressionless. 

“Here? In Forks?” 

“They’re friends,” Alice reassured me. “Everything’s 
going to be fine. Don’t worry. And then, Jasper has to 
teach us a few courses on newborn elimination... .” 

Edward’s eyes brightened at that, and a brief smile 
flashed across his face. My stomach suddenly felt like 
it was full of sharp little splinters of ice. 



331 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“When are you going?” I asked in a hollow voice. I 
couldn’t stand this — the idea that someone might 
not come back. What if it was Emmett, so brave and 
thoughtless that he was never the least bit cautious? 
Or Esme, so sweet and motherly that I couldn’t even 
imagine her in a fight? Or Alice, so tiny, so fragile- 
looking? Or ... but I couldn’t even think the name, 
consider the possibility. 

“A week,” Edward said casually. “That ought to give 
us enough time.” 

The icy splinters twisted uncomfortably in my 
stomach. I was suddenly nauseated. 

“You look kind of green, Bella,” Alice commented. 

Edward put his arm around me and pulled me tightly 
against his side. “It’s going to be fine, Bella. Trust 
me.” 

Sure, I thought to myself. Trust him. He wasn’t the 
one who was going to have to sit behind and wonder 
whether or not the core of his existence was going to 
come home. 

And then it occurred to me. Maybe I didn’t need to sit 
behind. A week was more than enough time. 

“You’re looking for help,” I said slowly. 

“Yes.” Alice’s head cocked to the side as she 
processed the change in my tone. 

I looked only at her as I answered. My voice was just 
slightly louder than a whisper. “I could help.” 

Edward’s body was suddenly rigid, his arm too tight 
around me. He exhaled, and the sound was a hiss. 

332 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




But it was Alice, still calm, who answered. “That 
really wouldn’t be helpful.” 

“Why not?” I argued; I could hear the desperation in 
my voice. “Eight is better than seven. There’s more 
than enough time.” 

“There’s not enough time to make you helpful, Bella,” 
she disagreed coolly. “Do you remember how Jasper 
described the young ones? You’d be no good in a 
fight. You wouldn’t be able to control your instincts, 
and that would make you an easy target. And then 
Edward would get hurt trying to protect you.” She 
folded her arms across her chest, pleased with her 
unassailable logic. 

And I knew she was right, when she put it like that. I 
slumped in my seat, my sudden hope defeated. 
Beside me, Edward relaxed. 

He whispered the reminder in my ear. “Not because 
you’re afraid.” 

“Oh,” Alice said, and a blank look crossed her face. 
Then her expression became surly. “I hate last- 
minute cancellations. So that puts the party 
attendance list down to sixty-five... .” 

“Sixty-five!” My eyes bulged again. I didn’t have that 
many friends. Did I even know that many people? 

“Who canceled?” Edward wondered, ignoring me. 

“Renee.” 

“What?” I gasped. 



333 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“She was going to surprise you for your graduation, 
but something went wrong. You’ll have a message 
when you get home.” 

For a moment, I just let myself enjoy the relief. 
Whatever it was that went wrong for my mother, I was 
eternally grateful to it. If she had come to Forks now 
...I didn’t want to think about it. My head would 
explode. 

The message light was flashing when I got home. My 
feeling of relief flared again as I listened to my mother 
describe Phil’s accident on the ball field — while 
demonstrating a slide, he’d tangled up with the 
catcher and broken his thigh bone; he was entirely 
dependent on her, and there was no way she could 
leave him. My mom was still apologizing when the 
message cut off. 

“Well, that’s one,” I sighed. 

“One what?” Edward asked. 

“One person I don’t have to worry about getting killed 
this week.” 

He rolled his eyes. 

“Why won’t you and Alice take this seriously?” I 
demanded. “This is serious.” 

He smiled. “Confidence.” 

“Wonderful,” I grumbled. I picked up the phone and 
dialed Renee’s number. I knew it would be a long 
conversation, but I also knew that I wouldn’t have to 
contribute much. 



334 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I just listened, and reassured her every time I could 
get a word in: I wasn’t disappointed, I wasn’t mad, I 
wasn’t hurt. She should concentrate on helping Phil 
get better. I passed on my “get well soon” to Phil, and 
promised to call her with every single detail from 
Forks High’s generic graduation. Finally, I had to use 
my desperate need to study for finals to get off the 
phone. 

Edward’s patience was endless. He waited politely 
through the whole conversation, just playing with my 
hair and smiling whenever I looked up. It was 
probably superficial to notice such things while I had 
so many more important things to think about, but 
his smile still knocked the breath out of me. He was 
so beautiful that it made it hard sometimes to think 
about anything else, hard to concentrate on Phil’s 
troubles or Renee’s apologies or hostile vampire 
armies. I was only human. 

As soon as I hung up, I stretched onto my tiptoes to 
kiss him. He put his hands around my waist and 
lifted me onto the kitchen counter, so I wouldn’t have 
to reach as far. That worked for me. I locked my arms 
around his neck and melted against his cold chest. 

Too soon, as usual, he pulled away. 

I felt my face slip into a pout. He laughed at my 
expression as he extricated himself from my arms and 
legs. He leaned against the counter next to me and 
put one arm lightly around my shoulders. 

“I know you think that I have some kind of perfect, 
unyielding self-control, but that’s not actually the 
case.” 

“I wish,” I sighed. 



335 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




And he sighed, too. 

“After school tomorrow,” he said, changing the 
subject, “I’m going hunting with Carlisle, Esme, and 
Rosalie. Just for a few hours — we’ll stay close. Alice, 
Jasper, and Emmett should be able to keep you safe.” 

“Ugh,” I grumbled. Tomorrow was the first day of 
finals, and it was only a half-day. I had Calculus and 
History — the only two challenges in my line-up — so 
I’d have almost the whole day without him, and 
nothing to do but worry. “I hate being babysat.” 

“It’s temporary,” he promised. 

“Jasper will be bored. Emmett will make fun of me.” 
“They’ll be on their best behavior.” 

“Right,” I grumbled. 

And then it occurred to me that I did have one option 
besides babysitters. “You know ... I haven’t been to La 
Push since the bonfire.” 

I watched his face carefully for any change in 
expression. His eyes tightened the tiniest bit. 

“I’d be safe enough there,” I reminded him. 

He thought about it for a few seconds. “You’re 
probably right.” 

His face was calm, but just a little too smooth. I 
almost asked if he’d rather I stayed here, but then I 
thought of the ribbing Emmett would no doubt dish 
out, and I changed the subject. “Are you thirsty 
already?” I asked, reaching up to stroke the light 



336 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




shadow beneath his eye. His irises were still a deep 
gold. 

“Not really.” He seemed reluctant to answer, and that 
surprised me. I waited for an explanation. 

“We want to be as strong as possible,” he explained, 
still reluctant. “Well probably hunt again on the way, 
looking for big game.” 

“That makes you stronger?” 

He searched my face for something, but there was 
nothing to find but curiosity. 

“Yes,” he finally said. “Human blood makes us the 
strongest, though only fractionally. Jasper’s been 
thinking about cheating — adverse as he is to the 
idea, he’s nothing if not practical — but he won’t 
suggest it. He knows what Carlisle will say.” 

“Would that help?” I asked quietly. 

“It doesn’t matter. We aren’t going to change who we 
are.” 

I frowned. If something helped even the odds ... and 
then I shuddered, realizing I was willing to have a 
stranger die to protect him. I was horrified at myself, 
but not entirely able to deny it, either. 

He changed the subject again. “That’s why they’re so 
strong, of course. The newborns are full of human 
blood — their own blood, reacting to the change. It 
lingers in the tissues and strengthens them. Their 
bodies use it up slowly, like Jasper said, the strength 
starting to wane after about a year.” 

“How strong will I be?” 

337 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He grinned. “Stronger than I am.” 

“Stronger than Emmett?” 

The grin got bigger. “Yes. Do me a favor and challenge 
him to an arm-wrestling match. It would be a good 
experience for him.” 

I laughed. It sounded so ridiculous. 

Then I sighed and hopped down from the counter, 
because I really couldn’t put it off any longer. I had to 
cram, and cram hard. Luckily I had Edward’s help, 
and Edward was an excellent tutor — since he knew 
absolutely everything. I figured my biggest problem 
would be just focusing on the tests. If I didn’t watch 
myself, I might end up writing my History essay on 
the vampire wars of the South. 

I took a break to call Jacob, and Edward seemed just 
as comfortable as he had when I was on the phone 
with Renee. He played with my hair again. 

Though it was the middle of the afternoon, my call 
woke Jacob up, and he was grouchy at first. He 
cheered right up when I asked if I could visit the next 
day. The Quileute school was already out for the 
summer, so he told me to come over as early as I 
could. I was pleased to have an option besides being 
babysat. There was a tiny bit more dignity in 
spending the day with Jacob. 

Some of that dignity was lost when Edward insisted 
again on delivering me to the border line like a child 
being exchanged by custodial guardians. 

“So how do you feel you did on your exams?” Edward 
asked on the way, making small talk. 



338 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“History was easy, but I don’t know about the 
Calculus. It seemed like it was making sense, so that 
probably means I failed.” 

He laughed. “I’m sure you did fine. Or, if you’re really 
worried, I could bribe Mr. Varner to give you an A.” 

“Er, thanks, but no thanks.” 

He laughed again, but suddenly stopped when we 
turned the last bend and saw the red car waiting. He 
frowned in concentration, and then, as he parked the 
car, he sighed. 

“What’s wrong?” I asked, my hand on the door. 

He shook his head. “Nothing.” His eyes were narrowed 
as he stared through the windshield toward the other 
car. I’d seen that look before. 

“You’re not listening to Jacob, are you?” I accused. 

“It’s not easy to ignore someone when he’s shouting.” 

“Oh.” I thought about that for a second. “What’s he 
shouting?” I whispered. 

“I’m absolutely certain he’ll mention it himself,” 
Edward said in a wry tone. 

I would have pressed the issue, but then Jacob 
honked his horn — two quick impatient honks. 

“That’s impolite,” Edward growled. 

“That’s Jacob,” I sighed, and I hurried out before 
Jacob did something to really set Edward’s teeth on 
edge. 



339 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I waved to Edward before I got into the Rabbit and, 
from that distance, it looked like he was truly upset 
about the honking thing ... or whatever Jacob was 
thinking about. But my eyes were weak and made 
mistakes all the time. 

I wanted Edward to come to me. I wanted to make 
both of them get out of their cars and shake hands 
and be friends — be Edward and Jacob rather than 
vampire and werewolf. It was as if I had those two 
stubborn magnets in my hands again, and I was 
holding them together, trying to force nature to 
reverse herself... . 

I sighed, and climbed in Jacob’s car. 

“Hey, Bells.” Jake’s tone was cheerful, but his voice 
dragged. I examined his face as he started down the 
road, driving a little faster than I did, but slower than 
Edward, on his way back to La Push. 

Jacob looked different, maybe even sick. His eyelids 
drooped and his face was drawn. His shaggy hair 
stuck out in random directions; it was almost to his 
chin in some places. 

“Are you all right, Jake?” 

“Just tired,” he managed to get out before he was 
overcome by a massive yawn. When he finished, he 
asked, “What do you want to do today?” 

I eyed him for a moment. “Let’s just hang out at your 
place for now,” I suggested. He didn’t look like he was 
up for much more than that. “We can ride our bikes 
later.” 

“Sure, sure,” he said, yawning again. 



340 | P a g e

Jacob’s house was vacant, and that felt strange. I 
realized I thought of Billy as a nearly permanent 
fixture there. 

“Where’s your dad?” 

“Over at the Clearwaters’. He’s been hanging out there 
a lot since Harry died. Sue gets lonely.” 

Jacob sat down on the old couch that was no bigger 
than a loveseat and squished himself to the side to 
make room for me. 

“Oh. That’s nice. Poor Sue.” 

“Yeah ... she’s having some trouble... .” He hesitated. 
“With her kids.” 

“Sure, it’s got to be hard on Seth and Leah, losing 
their dad... .” 

“Uh-huh,” he agreed, lost in thought. He picked up 
the remote and flipped on the TV without seeming to 
think about it. He yawned. 

“What’s with you, Jake? You’re like a zombie.” 

“I got about two hours of sleep last night, and four the 
night before,” he told me. He stretched his long arms 
slowly, and I could hear the joints crack as he flexed. 
He settled his left arm along the back of the sofa 
behind me, and slumped back to rest his head 
against the wall. “I’m exhausted.” 

“Why aren’t you sleeping?” I asked. 

He made a face. “Sam’s being difficult. He doesn’t 
trust your bloodsuckers. I’ve been running double 



341 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




shifts for two weeks and nobody’s touched me yet, 
but he still doesn’t buy it. So I’m on my own for now.” 

“Double shifts? Is this because you’re trying to watch 
out for me? Jake, that’s wrong! You need to sleep. I’ll 
be fine.” 

“It’s no big deal.” His eyes were abruptly more alert. 
“Hey, did you ever find out who was in your room? Is 
there anything new?” 

I ignored the second question. “No, we didn’t find 
anything out about my, um, visitor.” 

“Then 111 be around,” he said as his eyes slid closed. 

“Jake ... ,” I started to whine. 

“Hey, it’s the least I can do — I offered eternal 
servitude, remember. I’m your slave for life.” 

“I don’t want a slave!” 

His eyes didn’t open. “What do you want, Bella?” 

“I want my friend Jacob — and I don’t want him half- 
dead, hurting himself in some misguided attempt — ” 

He cut me off. “Look at it this way — I’m hoping I can 
track down a vampire I’m allowed to kill, okay?” 

I didn’t answer. He looked at me then, peeking at my 
reaction. 

“Kidding, Bella.” 

I stared at the TV. 



342 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“So, any special plans next week? You’re graduating. 
Wow. That’s big.” His voice turned flat, and his face, 
already drawn, looked downright haggard as his eyes 
closed again — not in exhaustion this time, but in 
denial. I realized that graduation still had a horrible 
significance for him, though my intentions were now 
disrupted. 

“No special plans,” I said carefully, hoping he would 
hear the reassurance in my words without a more 
detailed explanation. I didn’t want to get into it now. 
For one thing, he didn’t look up for any difficult 
conversations. For another, I knew he would read too 
much into my qualms. “Well, I do have to go to a 
graduation party. Mine.” I made a disgusted sound. 
“Alice loves parties, and she’s invited the whole town 
to her place the night of. It’s going to be horrible.” 

His eyes opened as I spoke, and a relieved smile made 
his face look less worn. “I didn’t get an invitation. I’m 
hurt,” he teased. 

“Consider yourself invited. It’s supposedly my party, 
so I should be able to ask who I want.” 

“Thanks,” he said sarcastically, his eyes slipping 
closed once more. 

“I wish you would come,” I said without any hope. “It 
would be more fun. For me, I mean.” 

“Sure, sure,” he mumbled. “That would be very ... 
wise ...” His voice trailed off. 

A few seconds later, he was snoring. 

Poor Jacob. I studied his dreaming face, and liked 
what I saw. While he slept, every trace of 
defensiveness and bitterness disappeared and 

343 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




suddenly he was the boy who had been my very best 
friend before all the werewolf nonsense had gotten in 
the way. He looked so much younger. He looked like 
my Jacob. 

I nestled into the couch to wait out his nap, hoping he 
would sleep for a while and make up some of what 
he’d lost. I flipped through channels, but there wasn’t 
much on. I settled for a cooking show, knowing, as I 
watched, that I’d never put that much effort into 
Charlie’s dinner. Jacob continued to snore, getting 
louder. I turned up the TV. 

I was strangely relaxed, almost sleepy, too. This 
house felt safer than my own, probably because no 
one had ever come looking for me here. I curled up on 
the sofa and thought about taking a nap myself. 
Maybe I would have, but Jacob’s snoring was 
impossible to tune out. So, instead of sleeping, I let 
my mind wander. 

Finals were done, and most of them had been a 
cakewalk. Calculus, the one exception, was behind 
me, pass or fail. My high school education was over. 
And I didn’t really know how I felt about that. I 
couldn’t look at it objectively, tied up as it was with 
my human life being over. 

I wondered how long Edward planned to use this “not 
because you’re scared” excuse. I was going to have to 
put my foot down sometime. 

If I were thinking practically, I knew it made more 
sense to ask Carlisle to change me the second I made 
it through the graduation line. Forks was becoming 
nearly as dangerous as a war zone. No, Forks was a 
war zone. Not to mention ... it would be a good excuse 
to miss the graduation party. I smiled to myself as I 



344 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




thought of that most trivial of reasons for changing. 
Silly ... yet still compelling. 

But Edward was right — I wasn’t quite ready yet. 

And I didn’t want to be practical. I wanted Edward to 
be the one. It wasn’t a rational desire. I was sure that 
— about two seconds after someone actually bit me 
and the venom started burning through my veins — I 
really wouldn’t care anymore who had done it. So it 
shouldn’t make a difference. 

It was hard to define, even to myself, why it mattered. 
There was just something about him being the one to 
make the choice — to want to keep me enough that 
he wouldn’t just allow me to be changed, he would act 
to keep me. It was childish, but I liked the idea that 
his lips would be the last good thing I would feel. 

Even more embarrassingly, something I would never 
say aloud, I wanted his venom to poison my system. It 
would make me belong to him in a tangible, 
quantifiable way. 

But I knew he was going to stick to his marriage 
scheme like glue — because a delay was what he was 
clearly after and it was working so far. I tried to 
imagine telling my parents that I was getting married 
this summer. Telling Angela and Ben and Mike. I 
couldn’t. I couldn’t think of the words to say. It would 
be easier to tell them I was becoming a vampire. And I 
was sure that at least my mother — were I to tell her 
every detail of the truth — would be more strenuously 
opposed to me getting married than to me a becoming 
vampire. I grimaced to myself as I imagined her 
horrified expression. 

Then, for just a second, I saw that same odd vision of 
Edward and me on a porch swing, wearing clothes 
from another kind of world. A world where it would 

345 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




surprise no one if I wore his ring on my finger. A 
simpler place, where love was defined in simpler 
ways. One plus one equals two... . 

Jacob snorted and rolled to his side. His arm swung 
off the back of the couch and pinned me against his 
body. 

Holy crow, but he was heavy! And hot. It was 
sweltering after just a few seconds. 

I tried to slide out from under his arm without waking 
him, but I had to shove a little bit, and when his arm 
fell off me, his eyes snapped open. He jumped to his 
feet, looking around anxiously. 

“What? What?” he asked, disoriented. 

“It’s just me, Jake. Sorry I woke you.” 

He turned to look at me, blinking and confused. 
“Bella?” 

“Hey, sleepy.” 

“Oh, man! Did I fall asleep? I’m sorry! How long was I 
out?” 

“A few Emerils. I lost count.” 

He flopped back on the couch next to me. “Wow. 

Sorry about that, really.” 

I patted his hair, trying to smooth the wild disarray. 
“Don’t feel bad. I’m glad you got some sleep.” 

He yawned and stretched. “I’m useless these days. No 
wonder Billy’s always gone. I’m so boring.” 



346 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You’re fine,” I assured him. 



“Ugh, let’s go outside. I need to walk around or I’ll 
pass out again.” 

“Jake, go back to sleep. I’m good. I’ll call Edward to 
come pick me up.” I patted my pockets as I spoke, 
and realized they were empty. “Shoot, I’ll have to 
borrow your phone. I think I must have left his in the 
car.” I started to unfold myself. 

“No!” Jacob insisted, grabbing my hand. “No, stay. 
You hardly ever make it down. I can’t believe I wasted 
all this time.” 

He pulled me off the couch as he spoke, and then led 
the way outside, ducking his head as he passed 
under the doorframe. It had gotten much cooler while 
Jacob slept; the air was unseasonably cold — there 
must be a storm on the way. It felt like February, not 
May. 

The wintry air seemed to make Jacob more alert. He 
paced back and forth in front of the house for a 
minute, dragging me along with him. 

“I’m an idiot,” he muttered to himself. 

“What’s the matter, Jake? So you fell asleep.” I 
shrugged. 

“I wanted to talk to you. I can’t believe this.” 

“Talk to me now,” I said. 

Jacob met my eyes for a second, and then looked 
away quickly toward the trees. It almost looked like 
he was blushing, but it was hard to tell with his dark 
skin. 

347 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I suddenly remembered what Edward had said when 
he dropped me off — that Jacob would tell me 
whatever he was shouting in his head. I started 
gnawing on my lip. 

“Look,” Jacob said. “I was planning to do this a little 
bit differently.” He laughed, and it sounded like he 
was laughing at himself. “Smoother,” he added. “I was 
going to work up to it, but” — and he looked at the 
clouds, dimmer as the afternoon progressed — “I’m 
out of time to work.” 

He laughed again, nervous. We were still pacing 
slowly. 

“What are you talking about?” I demanded. 

He took a deep breath. “I want to tell you something. 
And you already know it . . . but I think I should say it 
out loud anyway. Just so there’s never any confusion 
on the subject.” 

I planted my feet, and he came to a stop. I took my 
hand away and folded my arms across my chest. I 
was suddenly sure that I didn’t want to know what he 
was building up to. 

Jacob’s eyebrows pulled down, throwing his deep-set 
eyes into shadow. They were pitch black as they 
bored into mine. 

“I’m in love with you, Bella,” Jacob said in a strong, 
sure voice. “Bella, I love you. And I want you to pick 
me instead of him. I know you don’t feel that way, but 
I need the truth out there so that you know your 
options. I wouldn’t want a miscommunication to 
stand in our way.”

I stared at him for a long minute, speechless. I could 
not think of one thing to say to him. 

As he watched my dumbfounded expression, the 
seriousness left his face. 

“Okay,” he said, grinning. “That’s all.” 

“Jake — ” It felt like there was something big sticking 
in my throat. I tried to clear the obstruction. “I can’t 
— I mean I don’t ... I have to go.” 

I turned, but he grabbed my shoulders and spun me 
around. 

“No, wait. I know that, Bella. But, look, answer me 
this, all right? Do you want me to go away and never 
see you again? Be honest.” 

It was hard to concentrate on his question, so it took 
a minute to answer. “No, I don’t want that,” I finally 
admitted. 

Jacob grinned again. “See.” 

“But I don’t want you around for the same reason 
that you want me around,” I objected. 

“Tell me exactly why you want me around, then.” 

I thought carefully. “I miss you when you’re not there. 
When you’re happy,” I qualified carefully, “it makes 
me happy. But I could say the same thing about 



349 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



Charlie, Jacob. You’re family. I love you, but I’m not 
in love with you.” 

He nodded, unruffled. “But you do want me around.” 
“Yes.” I sighed. He was impossible to discourage. 

“Then 111 stick around.” 

“You’re a glutton for punishment,” I grumbled. 

“Yep.” He stroked the tips of his fingers across my 
right cheek. I slapped his hand away. 

“Do you think you could behave yourself a little 
better, at least?” I asked, irritated. 

“No, I don’t. You decide, Bella. You can have me the 
way I am — bad behavior included — or not at all.” 

I stared at him, frustrated. “That’s mean.” 

“So are you.” 

That pulled me up short, and I took an involuntary 
step back. He was right. If I wasn’t mean — and 
greedy, too — I would tell him I didn’t want to be 
friends and walk away. It was wrong to try to keep my 
friend when that would hurt him. I didn’t know what I 
was doing here, but I was suddenly sure that it wasn’t 
good. 

“You’re right,” I whispered. 

He laughed. “I forgive you. Just try not to get too mad 
at me. Because I recently decided that I’m not giving 
up. There really is something irresistible about a lost 
cause.”

“Jacob.” I stared into his dark eyes, trying to make 
him take me seriously. “I love him, Jacob. He’s my 
whole life.” 

“You love me, too,” he reminded me. He held up his 
hand when I started to protest. “Not the same way, I 
know. But he’s not your whole life, either. Not 
anymore. Maybe he was once, but he left. And now 
he’s just going to have to deal with the consequence 
of that choice — me.” 

I shook my head. “You’re impossible.” 

Suddenly, he was serious. He took my chin in his 
hand, holding it firmly so that I couldn’t look away 
from his intent gaze. 

“Until your heart stops beating, Bella,” he said. “I’ll be 
here — fighting. Don’t forget that you have options.” 

“I don’t want options,” I disagreed, trying to yank my 
chin free unsuccessfully. “And my heartbeats are 
numbered, Jacob. The time is almost gone.” 

His eyes narrowed. “All the more reason to fight — 
fight harder now, while I can,” he whispered. 

He still had my chin — his fingers holding too tight, 
till it hurt — and I saw the resolve form abruptly in 
his eyes. 

“N — ” I started to object, but it was too late. 

His lips crushed mine, stopping my protest. He kissed 
me angrily, roughly, his other hand gripping tight 
around the back of my neck, making escape 
impossible. I shoved against his chest with all my 
strength, but he didn’t even seem to notice. His 



351 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




mouth was soft, despite the anger, his lips molding to 
mine in a warm, unfamiliar way. 

I grabbed at his face, trying to push it away, failing 
again. He seemed to notice this time, though, and it 
aggravated him. His lips forced mine open, and I 
could feel his hot breath in my mouth. 

Acting on instinct, I let my hands drop to my side, 
and shut down. I opened my eyes and didn’t fight, 
didn’t feel ... just waited for him to stop. 

It worked. The anger seemed to evaporate, and he 
pulled back to look at me. He pressed his lips softly to 
mine again, once, twice ... a third time. I pretended I 
was a statue and waited. 

Finally, he let go of my face and leaned away. 

“Are you done now?” I asked in an expressionless 
voice. 

“Yes,” he sighed. He started to smile, closing his eyes. 

I pulled my arm back and then let it snap forward, 
punching him in the mouth with as much power as I 
could force out of my body. 

There was a crunching sound. 

“Ow! OW!” I screamed, frantically hopping up and 
down in agony while I clutched my hand to my chest. 
It was broken, I could feel it. 

Jacob stared at me in shock. “Are you all right?” 

“No, dammit! You broke my hand!” 



352 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Bella, you broke your hand. Now stop dancing 
around and let me look at it.” 



“Don’t touch me! I’m going home right now!” 

“I’ll get my car,” he said calmly. He wasn’t even 
rubbing his jaw like they did in the movies. How 
pathetic. 

“No, thanks,” I hissed. “I’d rather walk.” I turned 
toward the road. It was only a few miles to the border. 
As soon as I got away from him, Alice would see me. 
She’d send somebody to pick me up. 

“Just let me drive you home,” Jacob insisted. 
Unbelievably, he had the nerve to wrap his arm 
around my waist. 

I jerked away from him. 

“Fine!” I growled. “Do! I can’t wait to see what Edward 
does to you! I hope he snaps your neck, you pushy, 
obnoxious, moronic DOG!” 

Jacob rolled his eyes. He walked me to the passenger 
side of his car and helped me in. When he got in the 
driver’s side, he was whistling. 

“Didn’t I hurt you at all?” I asked, furious and 
annoyed. 

“Are you kidding? If you hadn’t started screaming, I 
might not have figured out that you were trying to 
punch me. I may not be made out of stone, but I’m 
not that soft.” 

“I hate you, Jacob Black.” 

“That’s good. Hate is a passionate emotion.” 

353 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I’ll give you passionate,” I muttered under my breath. 
“Murder, the ultimate crime of passion.” 

“Oh, c’mon,” he said, all cheery and looking like he 
was about to start whistling again. “That had to be 
better than kissing a rock.” 

“Not even remotely close,” I told him coldly. 

He pursed his lips. “You could just be saying that.” 

“But I’m not.” 

That seemed to bother him for a second, but then he 
perked up. “You’re just mad. I don’t have any 
experience with this kind of thing, but I thought it 
was pretty incredible myself.” 

“Ugh,” I groaned. 

“You’re going to think about it tonight. When he 
thinks you’re asleep, you’ll be thinking about your 
options.” 

“If I think about you tonight, it will be because I’m 
having a nightmare.” 

He slowed the car to a crawl, turning to stare at me 
with his dark eyes wide and earnest. “Just think 
about how it could be, Bella,” he urged in a soft, eager 
voice. “You wouldn’t have to change anything for me. 
You know Charlie would be happy if you picked me. I 
could protect you just as well as your vampire can — 
maybe better. And I would make you happy, Bella. 
There’s so much I could give you that he can’t. I’ll bet 
he couldn’t even kiss you like that — because he 
would hurt you. I would never, never hurt you, Bella.” 



I held up my injured hand. 

354 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He sighed. “That wasn’t my fault. You should have 
known better.” 

“Jacob, I can’t be happy without him.” 

“You’ve never tried,” he disagreed. “When he left, you 
spent all your energy holding on to him. You could be 
happy if you let go. You could be happy with me.” 

“I don’t want to be happy with anyone but him,” I 
insisted. 

“You’ll never be able to be as sure of him as you are of 
me. He left you once, he could do it again.” 

“No, he will not,” I said through my teeth. The pain of 
the memory bit into me like the lash of a whip. It 
made me want to hurt him back. “You left me once,” I 
reminded him in a cold voice, thinking of the weeks 
he’d hidden from me, the words he’d said to me in the 
woods beside his home... . 

“I never did,” he argued hotly. “They told me I couldn’t 
tell you — that it wasn’t safe for you if we were 
together. But I never left, never! I used to run around 
your house at night — like I do now. Just making 
sure you were okay.” 

I wasn’t about to let him make me feel bad for him 
now. 

“Take me home. My hand hurts.” 

He sighed, and started driving at a normal speed, 
watching the road. 

“Just think about it, Bella.” 

“No,” I said stubbornly. 

355 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You will. Tonight. And I’ll be thinking about you 
while you’re thinking about me.” 



“Like I said, a nightmare.” 

He grinned over at me. “You kissed me back.” 

I gasped, unthinkingly balling my hands up into fists 
again, hissing when my broken hand reacted. 

“Are you okay?” he asked. 

“I did not.” 

“I think I can tell the difference.” 

“Obviously you can’t — that was not kissing back, 
that was trying to get you the hell off of me, you 
idiot.” 

He laughed a low, throaty laugh. “Touchy. Almost 
overly defensive, I would say.” 

I took a deep breath. There was no point in arguing 
with him; he would twist anything I said. I 
concentrated on my hand, trying to stretch out my 
fingers, to ascertain where the broken parts were. 
Sharp pains stabbed along my knuckles. I groaned. 

“I’m really sorry about your hand,” Jacob said, 
sounding almost sincere. “Next time you want to hit 
me, use a baseball bat or a crowbar, okay?” 

“Don’t think I’ll forget that,” I muttered. 

I didn’t realize where we were going until we were on 
my road. 

“Why are you taking me here?” I demanded. 

356 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He looked at me blankly. “I thought you said you were 
going home?” 

“Ugh. I guess you can’t take me to Edward’s house, 
can you?” I ground my teeth in frustration. 

Pain twisted across his face, and I could see that this 
affected him more than anything else I’d said. 

“This is your home, Bella,” he said quietly. 

“Yes, but do any doctors live here?” I asked, holding 
up my hand again. 

“Oh.” He thought about that for a minute. “I’ll take 
you to the hospital. Or Charlie can.” 

“I don’t want to go to the hospital. It’s embarrassing 
and unnecessary.” 

He let the Rabbit idle in front of the house, 
deliberating with an unsure expression. Charlie’s 
cruiser was in the driveway. 

I sighed. “Go home, Jacob.” 

I climbed out of the car awkwardly, heading for the 
house. The engine cut off behind me, and I was less 
surprised than annoyed to find Jacob beside me 
again. 

“What are you going to do?” he asked. 

“I am going to get some ice on my hand, and then I 
am going to call Edward and tell him to come and get 
me and take me to Carlisle so that he can fix my 
hand. Then, if you’re still here, I am going to go hunt 
up a crowbar.” 



357 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He didn’t answer. He opened the front door and held 
it for me. 

We walked silently past the front room where Charlie 
was lying on the sofa. 

“Hey, kids,” he said, sitting forward. “Nice to see you 
here, Jake.” 

“Hey, Charlie,” Jacob answered casually, pausing. I 
stalked on to the kitchen. 

“What’s wrong with her?” Charlie wondered. 

“She thinks she broke her hand,” I heard Jacob tell 
him. I went to the freezer and pulled out a tray of ice 
cubes. 

“How did she do that?” As my father, I thought 
Charlie ought to sound a bit less amused and a bit 
more concerned. 

Jacob laughed. “She hit me.” 

Charlie laughed, too, and I scowled while I beat the 
tray against the edge of the sink. The ice scattered 
inside the basin, and I grabbed a handful with my 
good hand and wrapped the cubes in the dishcloth on 
the counter. 

“Why did she hit you?” 

“Because I kissed her,” Jacob said, unashamed. 

“Good for you, kid,” Charlie congratulated him. 

I ground my teeth and went for the phone. I dialed 
Edward’s cell. 



358 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Bella?” he answered on the first ring. He sounded 
more than relieved — he was delighted. I could hear 
the Volvo’s engine in the background; he was already 
in the car — that was good. “You left the phone ... I’m 
sorry, did Jacob drive you home?” 

“Yes,” I grumbled. “Will you come and get me, 
please?” 

“I’m on my way,” he said at once. “What’s wrong?” 

“I want Carlisle to look at my hand. I think it’s 
broken.” 

It had gone quiet in the front room, and I wondered 
when Jacob would bolt. I smiled a grim smile, 
imagining his discomfort. 

“What happened?” Edward demanded, his voice going 
flat. 

“I punched Jacob,” I admitted. 

“Good,” Edward said bleakly. “Though I’m sorry you’re 
hurt.” 

I laughed once, because he sounded as pleased as 
Charlie had. 

“I wish I’d hurt him.” I sighed in frustration. “I didn’t 
do any damage at all.” 

“I can fix that,” he offered. 

“I was hoping you would say that.” 

There was a slight pause. “That doesn’t sound like 
you,” he said, wary now. “What did he do?” 



359 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“He kissed me,” I growled. 

All I heard on the other end of the line was the sound 
of an engine accelerating. 

In the other room, Charlie spoke again. “Maybe you 
ought to take off, Jake,” he suggested. 

“I think I’ll hang out here, if you don’t mind.” 

“Your funeral,” Charlie muttered. 

“Is the dog still there?” Edward finally spoke again. 

“Yes.” 

“I’m around the corner,” he said darkly, and the line 
disconnected. 

As I hung up the phone, smiling, I heard the sound of 
his car racing down the street. The brakes protested 
loudly as he slammed to a stop out front. I went to get 
the door. 

“How’s your hand?” Charlie asked as I walked by. 
Charlie looked uncomfortable. Jacob lolled next to 
him on the sofa, perfectly at ease. 

I lifted the ice pack to show it off. “It’s swelling.” 

“Maybe you should pick on people your own size,” 
Charlie suggested. 

“Maybe,” I agreed. I walked on to open the door. 
Edward was waiting. 

“Let me see,” he murmured. 



360 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He examined my hand gently, so carefully that it 
caused me no pain at all. His hands were almost as 
cold as the ice, and they felt good against my skin. 

“I think you’re right about the break,” he said. “I’m 
proud of you. You must have put some force behind 
this.” 

“As much as I have.” I sighed. “Not enough, 
apparently.” 

He kissed my hand softly. “I’ll take care of it,” he 
promised. And then he called, “Jacob,” his voice still 
quiet and even. 

“Now, now,” Charlie cautioned. 

I heard Charlie heave himself off of the sofa. Jacob got 
to the hall first, and much more quietly, but Charlie 
was not far behind him. Jacob’s expression was alert 
and eager. 

“I don’t want any fighting, do you understand?” 
Charlie looked only at Edward when he spoke. “I can 
go put my badge on if that makes my request more 
official.” 

“That won’t be necessary,” Edward said in a 
restrained tone. 

“Why don’t you arrest me, Dad?” I suggested. “I’m the 
one throwing punches.” 

Charlie raised an eyebrow. “Do you want to press 
charges, Jake?” 

“No.” Jacob grinned, incorrigible. “I’ll take the trade 
any day.” 



361 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Edward grimaced. 

“Dad, don’t you have a baseball bat somewhere in 
your room? I want to borrow it for a minute.” 

Charlie looked at me evenly. “Enough, Bella.” 

“Let’s go have Carlisle look at your hand before you 
wind up in a jail cell,” Edward said. He put his arm 
around me and pulled me toward the door. 

“Fine,” I said, leaning against him. I wasn’t so angry 
anymore, now that Edward was with me. I felt 
comforted, and my hand didn’t bother me as much. 

We were walking down the sidewalk when I heard 
Charlie whispering anxiously behind me. 

“What are you doing? Are you crazy?” 

“Give me a minute, Charlie,” Jacob answered. “Don’t 
worry, I’ll be right back.” 

I looked back and Jacob was following us, stopping to 
close the door in Charlie’s surprised and uneasy face. 

Edward ignored him at first, leading me to the car. He 
helped me inside, shut the door, and then turned to 
face Jacob on the sidewalk. 

I leaned anxiously through the open window. Charlie 
was visible in the house, peeking through the drapes 
in the front room. 

Jacob’s stance was casual, his arms folded across his 
chest, but the muscles in his jaw were tight. 



362 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Edward spoke in a voice so peaceful and gentle that it 
made the words strangely more threatening. “I’m not 
going to kill you now, because it would upset Bella.” 

“Hmph,” I grumbled. 

Edward turned slightly to throw me a quick smile. His 
face was still calm. “It would bother you in the 
morning,” he said, brushing his fingers across my 
cheek. 

Then he turned back to Jacob. “But if you ever bring 
her back damaged again — and I don’t care whose 
fault it is; I don’t care if she merely trips, or if a 
meteor falls out of the sky and hits her in the head — 
if you return her to me in less than the perfect 
condition that I left her in, you will be running with 
three legs. Do you understand that, mongrel?” 

Jacob rolled his eyes. 

“Who’s going back?” I muttered. 

Edward continued as if he hadn’t heard me. “And if 
you ever kiss her again, I will break your jaw for her,” 
he promised, his voice still gentle and velvet and 
deadly. 

“What if she wants me to?” Jacob drawled, arrogant. 
“Hah!” I snorted. 

“If that’s what she wants, then I won’t object.” Edward 
shrugged, untroubled. “You might want to wait for 
her to say it, rather than trust your interpretation of 
body language — but it’s your face.” 

Jacob grinned. 



363 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You wish,” I grumbled. 

“Yes, he does,” Edward murmured. 

“Well, if you’re done rummaging through my head,” 
Jacob said with a thick edge of annoyance, “why don’t 
you go take care of her hand?” 

“One more thing,” Edward said slowly. “I’ll be fighting 
for her, too. You should know that. I’m not taking 
anything for granted, and I’ll be fighting twice as hard 
as you will.” 

“Good,” Jacob growled. “It’s no fun beating someone 
who forfeits.” 

“She is mine.” Edward’s low voice was suddenly dark, 
not as composed as before. “I didn’t say I would fight 
fair.” 

“Neither did I.” 

“Best of luck.” 

Jacob nodded. “Yes, may the best man win.” 

“That sounds about right ... pup.” 

Jacob grimaced briefly, then he composed his face 
and leaned around Edward to smile at me. I glowered 
back. 

“I hope your hand feels better soon. I’m really sorry 
you’re hurt.” 

Childishly, I turned my face away from him. 

I didn’t look up again as Edward walked around the 
car and climbed into the driver’s side, so I didn’t 

364 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




know if Jacob went back into the house or continued 
to stand there, watching me. 

“How do you feel?” Edward asked as we drove away. 
“Irritated.” 

He chuckled. “I meant your hand.” 

I shrugged. “I’ve had worse.” 

“True,” he agreed, and frowned. 

Edward drove around the house to the garage. 

Emmett and Rosalie were there, Rosalie’s perfect legs, 
recognizable even sheathed in jeans, were sticking out 
from under the bottom of Emmett’s huge Jeep. 
Emmett was sitting beside her, one hand reached 
under the Jeep toward her. It took me a moment to 
realize that he was acting as the jack. 

Emmett watched curiously as Edward helped me 
carefully out of the car. His eyes zeroed in on the 
hand I cradled against my chest. 

Emmett grinned. “Fall down again, Bella?” 

I glared at him fiercely. “No, Emmett. I punched a 
werewolf in the face.” 

Emmett blinked, and then burst into a roar of 
laughter. 

As Edward led me past them, Rosalie spoke from 
under the car. 

“Jasper’s going to win the bet,” she said smugly. 



365 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Emmett’s laughter stopped at once, and he studied 
me with appraising eyes. 



“What bet?” I demanded, pausing. 

“Let’s get you to Carlisle,” Edward urged. He was 
staring at Emmett. His head shook infinitesimally. 

“What bet?” I insisted as I turned on him. 

“Thanks, Rosalie,” he muttered as he tightened his 
arm around my waist and pulled me toward the 
house. 

“Edward ... ,” I grumbled. 

“It’s infantile,” he shrugged. “Emmett and Jasper like 
to gamble.” 

“Emmett will tell me.” I tried to turn, but his arm was 
like iron around me. 

He sighed. “They’re betting on how many times you ... 
slip up in the first year.” 

“Oh.” I grimaced, trying to hide my sudden horror as I 
realized what he meant. “They have a bet about how 
many people I’ll kill?” 

“Yes,” he admitted unwillingly. “Rosalie thinks your 
temper will turn the odds in Jasper’s favor.” 

I felt a little high. “Jasper’s betting high.” 

“It will make him feel better if you have a hard time 
adjusting. He’s tired of being the weakest link.” 

“Sure. Of course it will. I guess I could throw in a few 
extra homicides, if it makes Jasper happy. Why not?” 

366 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I was babbling, my voice a blank monotone. In my 
head, I was seeing newspaper headlines, lists of 
names... . 

He squeezed me. “You don’t need to worry about it 
now. In fact, you don’t have to worry about it ever, if 
you don’t want to.” 

I groaned, and Edward, thinking it was the pain in my 
hand that bothered me, pulled me faster toward the 
house. 

My hand was broken, but there wasn’t any serious 
damage, just a tiny fissure in one knuckle. I didn’t 
want a cast, and Carlisle said I’d be fine in a brace if I 
promised to keep it on. I promised. 

Edward could tell I was out of it as Carlisle worked to 
fit a brace carefully to my hand. He worried aloud a 
few times that I was in pain, but I assured him that 
that wasn’t it. 

As if I needed — or even had room for — one more 
thing to worry about. 

All of Jasper’s stories about newly created vampires 
had been percolating in my head since he’d explained 
his past. Now those stories jumped into sharp focus 
with the news of his and Emmett’s wager. I wondered 
randomly what they were betting. What was a 
motivating prize when you had everything? 

I’d always known that I would be different. I hoped 
that I would be as strong as Edward said I would be. 
Strong and fast and, most of all, beautiful. Someone 
who could stand next to Edward and feel like she 
belonged there. 



367 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I’d been trying not to think too much about the other 
things that I would be. Wild. Bloodthirsty. Maybe I 
would not be able to stop myself from killing people. 
Strangers, people who had never harmed me. People 
like the growing number of victims in Seattle, who’d 
had families and friends and futures. People who’d 
had lives. And I could be the monster who took that 
away from them. 

But, in truth, I could handle that part — because I 
trusted Edward, trusted him absolutely, to keep me 
from doing anything I would regret. I knew he’d take 
me to Antarctica and hunt penguins if I asked him to. 
And I would do whatever it took to be a good person. 
A good vampire. That thought would have made me 
giggle, if not for this new worry. 

Because, if I really were somehow like that — like the 
nightmarish images of newborns that Jasper had 
painted in my head — could I possibly be me? And if 
all I wanted was to kill people, what would happen to 
the things I wanted now? 

Edward was so obsessed with me not missing 
anything while I was human. Usually, it seemed kind 
of silly. There weren’t many human experiences that I 
worried about missing. As long as I got to be with 
Edward, what else could I ask for? 

I stared at his face while he watched Carlisle fix my 
hand. There was nothing in this world that I wanted 
more than him. Would that, could that, change? 

Was there a human experience that I was not willing 
to give up?

“I have nothing to wear!” I moaned to myself. 

Every item of clothing I owned was strewn across my 
bed; my drawers and closets were bare. I stared into 
the empty recesses, willing something suitable to 
appear. 

My khaki skirt lay over the back of the rocking chair, 
waiting for me to discover something that went with it 
just exactly right. Something that would make me 
look beautiful and grown up. Something that said 
special occasion. I was coming up empty. 

It was almost time to go, and I was still wearing my 
favorite old sweats. Unless I could find something 
better here — and the odds weren’t looking good at 
this point — I was going to graduate in them. 

I scowled at the pile of clothes on my bed. 

The kicker was that I knew exactly what I would have 
worn if it were still available — my kidnapped red 
blouse. I punched the wall with my good hand. 

“Stupid, thieving, annoying vampire!” I growled. 

“What did I do?” Alice demanded. 

She was leaning casually beside the open window as 
if she’d been there the whole time. 

“Knock, knock,” she added with a grin. 

“Is it really so hard to wait for me to get the door?” 

369 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



She threw a flat, white box onto my bed. “I’m just 
passing through. I thought you might need something 
to wear.” 

I looked at the big package lying on top of my 
unsatisfying wardrobe and grimaced. 

“Admit it,” Alice said. “I’m a lifesaver.” 

“You’re a lifesaver,” I muttered. “Thanks.” 

“Well, it’s nice to get something right for a change. 

You don’t know how irritating it is — missing things 
the way I have been. I feel so useless. So ... normal.” 
She cringed in horror of the word. 

“I can’t imagine how awful that must feel. Being 
normal? Ugh.” 

She laughed. “Well, at least this makes up for missing 
your annoying thief — now I just have to figure out 
what I’m not seeing in Seattle.” 

When she said the words that way — putting the two 
situations together in one sentence — right then it 
clicked. The elusive something that had been 
bothering me for days, the important connection that 
I couldn’t quite put together, suddenly became clear. I 
stared at her, my face frozen with whatever 
expression was already in place. 

“Aren’t you going to open it?” she asked. She sighed 
when I didn’t move immediately, and tugged the top 
of the box off herself. She pulled something out and 
held it up, but I couldn’t concentrate on what it was. 
“Pretty, don’t you think? I picked blue, because I 
know it’s Edward’s favorite on you.” 



I wasn’t listening.

“It’s the same,” I whispered. 

“What is?” she demanded. “You don’t have anything 
like this. For crying out loud, you only own one skirt!” 

“No, Alice! Forget the clothes, listen!” 

“You don’t like it?” Alice’s face clouded with 
disappointment. 

“Listen, Alice, don’t you see? It’s the same! The one 
who broke in and stole my things, and the new 
vampires in Seattle. They’re together!” 

The clothes slipped from her fingers and fell back into 
the box. 

Alice focused now, her voice suddenly sharp. “Why do 
you think that?” 

“Remember what Edward said? About someone using 
the holes in your vision to keep you from seeing the 
newborns? And then what you said before, about the 
timing being too perfect — how careful my thief was 
to make no contact, as if he knew you would see that. 
I think you were right, Alice, I think he did know. I 
think he was using those holes, too. And what are the 
odds that two different people not only know enough 
about you to do that, but also decided to do it at 
exactly the same time? No way. It’s one person. The 
same one. The one who is making the army is the one 
who stole my scent.” 

Alice wasn’t accustomed to being taking by surprise. 
She froze, and was still for so long that I started 
counting in my head as I waited. She didn’t move for 
two minutes straight. Then her eyes refocused on me. 



371 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You’re right,” she said in a hollow tone. “Of course 
you’re right. And when you put it that way... .” 

“Edward had it wrong,” I whispered. “It was a test ... 
to see if it would work. If he could get in and out 
safely as long as he didn’t do anything you would be 
watching out for. Like trying to kill me... . And he 
didn’t take my things to prove he’d found me. He stole 
my scent ... so that others could find me.” 

Her eyes were wide with shock. I was right, and I 
could see that she knew it, too. 

“Oh, no,” she mouthed. 

I was through expecting my emotions to make sense 
anymore. As I processed the fact that someone had 
created an army of vampires — the army that had 
gruesomely murdered dozens of people in Seattle — 
for the express purpose of destroying me, I felt a 
spasm of relief. 

Part of it was finally solving that irritating feeling that 
I was missing something vital. 

But the larger part was something else entirely. 

“Well,” I whispered, “everyone can relax. Nobody’s 
trying to exterminate the Cullens after all.” 

“If you think that one thing has changed, you’re 
absolutely wrong,” Alice said through her teeth. “If 
someone wants one of us, they’re going to have to go 
through the rest of us to get to her.” 

“Thanks, Alice. But at least we know what they’re 
really after. That has to help.” 



372 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Maybe,” she muttered. She started pacing back and 
forth across my room. 

Thud, thud — a fist hammered against my door. 

I jumped. Alice didn’t seem to notice. 

“Aren’t you ready yet? We’re gonna be late!” Charlie 
complained, sounding edgy. Charlie hated occasions 
about as much as I did. In his case, a lot of the 
problem was having to dress up. 

“Almost. Give me a minute,” I said hoarsely. 

He was quiet for half a second. “Are you crying?” 

“No. I’m nervous. Go away.” 

I heard him clump down the stairs. 

“I have to go,” Alice whispered. 

“Why?” 

“Edward is coming. If he hears this ...” 

“Go, go!” I urged immediately. Edward would go 
berserk when he knew. I couldn’t keep it from him for 
long, but maybe the graduation ceremony wasn’t the 
best time for his reaction. 

“Put it on,” Alice commanded as she flitted out the 
window. 

I did what she said, dressing in a daze. 

I’d been planning to do something more sophisticated 
with my hair, but time was up, so it hung straight 
and boring as on any other day. It didn’t matter. I 

373 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




didn’t bother to look in the mirror, so I had no idea 
how Alice’s sweater and skirt ensemble worked. That 
didn’t matter, either. I threw the ugly yellow polyester 
graduation robe over my arm and hurried down the 
stairs. 

“You look nice,” Charlie said, already gruff with 
suppressed emotion. “Is that new?” 

“Yeah,” I mumbled, trying to concentrate. “Alice gave 
it to me. Thanks.” 

Edward arrived just a few minutes after his sister left. 
It wasn’t enough time for me to pull together a calm 
fapade. But, since we were riding in the cruiser with 
Charlie, he never had a chance to ask me what was 
wrong. 

Charlie had gotten stubborn last week when he’d 
learned that I was intending to ride with Edward to 
the graduation ceremony. And I could see his point — 
parents should have some rights come graduation 
day. I’d conceded with good grace, and Edward had 
cheerfully suggested that we all go together. Since 
Carlisle and Esme had no problem with this, Charlie 
couldn’t come up with a compelling objection; he’d 
agreed with poor grace. And now Edward rode in the 
backseat of my father’s police car, behind the 
fiberglass divider, with an amused expression — 
probably due to my father’s amused expression, and 
the grin that widened every time Charlie stole a 
glance at Edward in his rearview mirror. Which 
almost certainly meant that Charlie was imagining 
things that would get him in trouble with me if he 
said them out loud. 

“Are you all right?” Edward whispered when he 
helped me from the front seat in the school parking 
lot. 

374 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Nervous,” I answered, and it wasn’t even a lie. 

“You are so beautiful,” he said. 

He looked like he wanted to say more, but Charlie, in 
an obvious maneuver that he meant to be subtle, 
shrugged in between us and put his arm around my 
shoulders. 

“Are you excited?” he asked me. 

“Not really,” I admitted. 

“Bella, this is a big deal. You’re graduating from high 
school. It’s the real world for you now. College. Living 
on your own... . You’re not my little girl anymore.” 
Charlie choked up a bit at the end. 

“Dad,” I moaned. “Please don’t get all weepy on me.” 

“Who’s weepy?” he growled. “Now, why aren’t you 
excited?” 

“I don’t know, Dad. I guess it hasn’t hit yet or 
something.” 

“It’s good that Alice is throwing this party. You need 
something to perk you up.” 

“Sure. A party’s exactly what I need.” 

Charlie laughed at my tone and squeezed my 
shoulders. Edward looked at the clouds, his face 
thoughtful. 

My father had to leave us at the back door of the gym 
and go around to the main entrance with the rest of 
the parents. 



375 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




It was pandemonium as Ms. Cope from the front 
office and Mr. Varner the math teacher tried to line 
everyone up alphabetically. 

“Up front, Mr. Cullen,” Mr. Varner barked at Edward. 
“Hey, Bella!” 

I looked up to see Jessica Stanley waving at me from 
the back of the line with a smile on her face. 

Edward kissed me quickly, sighed, and went to go 
stand with the C’s. Alice wasn’t there. What was she 
going to do? Skip graduation? What poor timing on 
my part. I should have waited to figure things out 
until after this was over with. 

“Down here, Bella!” Jessica called again. 

I walked down the line to take my place behind 
Jessica, mildly curious as to why she was suddenly 
so friendly. As I got closer, I saw Angela five people 
back, watching Jessica with the same curiosity. 

Jess was babbling before I was in earshot. 

"... so amazing. I mean, it seems like we just met, and 
now we’re graduating together,” she gushed. “Can you 
believe it’s over? I feel like screaming!” 

“So do I,” I muttered. 

“This is all just so incredible. Do you remember your 
first day here? We were friends, like, right away. From 
the first time we saw each other. Amazing. And now 
I’m off to California and you’ll be in Alaska and I’m 
going to miss you so much! You have to promise that 
we’ll get together sometimes! I’m so glad you’re having 
a party. That’s perfect. Because we really haven’t 
376 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




spent much time together in a while and now we’re all 
leaving... .” 

She droned on and on, and I was sure the sudden 
return of our friendship was due to graduation 
nostalgia and gratitude for the party invite, not that 
I’d had anything to do with that. I paid attention as 
well as I could while I shrugged into my robe. And I 
found that I was glad that things could end on a good 
note with Jessica. 

Because it was an ending, no matter what Eric, the 
valedictorian, had to say about commencement 
meaning “beginning” and all the rest of the trite 
nonsense. Maybe more for me than for the rest, but 
we were all leaving something behind us today. 

It went so quickly. I felt like I’d hit the fast forward 
button. Were we supposed to march quite that fast? 
And then Eric was speed talking in his nervousness, 
the words and phrases running together so they 
didn’t make sense anymore. Principal Greene started 
calling names, one after the other without a long 
enough pause between; the front row in the 
gymnasium was rushing to catch up. Poor Ms. Cope 
was all thumbs as she tried to give the principal the 
right diploma to hand to the right student. 

I watched as Alice, suddenly appearing, danced 
across the stage to take hers, a look of deep 
concentration on her face. Edward followed behind, 
his expression confused, but not upset. Only the two 
of them could carry off the hideous yellow and still 
look the way they did. They stood out from the rest of 
the crowd, their beauty and grace otherworldly. I 
wondered how I’d ever fallen for their human farce. A 
couple of angels, standing there with wings intact, 
would be less conspicuous. 



377 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I heard Mr. Greene call my name and I rose from my 
chair, waiting for the line in front of me to move. I was 
conscious of cheering in the back of the gym, and I 
looked around to see Jacob pulling Charlie to his feet, 
both of them hooting in encouragement. I could just 
make out the top of Billy’s head beside Jake’s elbow. I 
managed to throw them an approximation of a smile. 

Mr. Greene finished with the list of names, and then 
continued to hand out diplomas with a sheepish grin 
as we filed past. 

“Congratulations, Miss Stanley,” he mumbled as Jess 
took hers. 

“Congratulations, Miss Swan,” he mumbled to me, 
pressing the diploma into my good hand. 

“Thanks,” I murmured. 

And that was it. 

I went to stand next to Jessica with the assembled 
graduates. Jess was all red around the eyes, and she 
kept blotting her face with the sleeve of her robe. It 
took me a second to understand that she was crying. 

Mr. Greene said something I didn’t hear, and 
everyone around me shouted and screamed. Yellow 
hats rained down. I pulled mine off, too late, and just 
let it fall to the ground. 

“Oh, Bella!” Jess blubbered over the sudden roar of 
conversation. “I can’t believe we’re done.” 

“I can’t believe it’s all over,” I mumbled. 

She threw her arms around my neck. “You have to 
promise we won’t lose touch.” 

378 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I hugged her back, feeling a little awkward as I 
dodged her request. “I’m so glad I know you, Jessica. 

It was a good two years.” 

“It was,” she sighed, and sniffed. Then she dropped 
her arms. “Lauren!” she squealed, waving over her 
head and pushing through the massed yellow gowns. 
Families were beginning to converge, pressing us 
tighter together. 

I caught sight of Angela and Ben, but they were 
surrounded by their families. I would congratulate 
them later. 

I craned my head, looking for Alice. 

“Congratulations,” Edward whispered in my ear, his 
arms winding around my waist. His voice was 
subdued; he’d been in no hurry for me to reach this 
particular milestone. 

“Urn, thanks.” 

“You don’t look like you’re over the nerves yet,” he 
noted. 

“Not quite yet.” 

“What’s left to worry about? The party? It won’t be 
that horrible.” 

“You’re probably right.” 

“Who are you looking for?” 

My searching wasn’t quite as subtle as I’d thought. 
“Alice — where is she?” 

“She ran out as soon as she had her diploma.” 

379 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




His voice took on a new tone. I looked up to see his 
confused expression as he stared toward the back 
door of the gym, and I made an impulse decision — 
the kind I really should think twice about, but rarely 
did. 

“Worrying about Alice?” I asked. 

“Er ...” He didn’t want to answer that. 

“What was she thinking about, anyway? To keep you 
out, I mean.” 

His eyes flashed down to my face, and narrowed in 
suspicion. “She was translating the Battle Hymn of 
the Republic into Arabic, actually. When she finished 
that, she moved on to Korean sign language.” 

I laughed nervously. “I suppose that would keep her 
head busy enough.” 

“You know what she’s hiding from me,” he accused. 

“Sure.” I smiled a weak smile. “I’m the one who came 
up with it.” 

He waited, confused. 

I looked around. Charlie would be on his way through 
the crowd now. 

“Knowing Alice,” I whispered in a rush, “she’ll 
probably try to keep this from you until after the 
party. But since I’m all for the party being canceled — 
well, don’t go berserk, regardless, okay? It’s always 
better to know as much as possible. It has to help 
somehow.” 

“What are you talking about?” 

380 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I saw Charlie’s head bob up over the other heads as 
he searched for me. He spotted me and waved. 

“Just stay calm, okay?” 

He nodded once, his mouth a grim line. 

In hurried whispers I explained my reasoning to him. 
“I think you’re wrong about things coming at us from 
all sides. I think it’s mostly coming at us from one 
side ... and I think it’s coming at me, really. It’s all 
connected, it has to be. It’s just one person who’s 
messing with Alice’s visions. The stranger in my room 
was a test, to see if someone could get around her. It’s 
got to be the same one who keeps changing his mind, 
and the newborns, and stealing my clothes — all of it 
goes together. My scent is for them.” 

His face had turned so white that I had a hard time 
finishing. 

“But no one’s coming for you, don’t you see? This is 
good — Esme and Alice and Carlisle, no one wants to 
hurt them!” 

His eyes were huge, wide with panic, dazed and 
horrified. He could see that I was right, just as Alice 
had. 

I put my hand on his cheek. “Calm,” I pleaded. 

“Bella!” Charlie crowed, pushing his way past the 
close-packed families around us. 

“Congratulations, baby!” He was still yelling, even 
though he was right at my ear now. He wrapped his 
arms around me, ever so slyly shuffling Edward off to 
the side as he did so. 



381 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Thanks,” I muttered, preoccupied by the expression 
on Edward’s face. He still hadn’t gained control. His 
hands were halfway extended toward me, like he was 
about to grab me and make a run for it. Only slightly 
more in control of myself than he was, running didn’t 
seem like such a terrible idea to me. 

“Jacob and Billy had to take off — did you see that 
they were here?” Charlie asked, taking a step back, 
but keeping his hands on my shoulders. He had his 
back to Edward — probably an effort to exclude him, 
but that was fine at the moment. Edward’s mouth 
was hanging open, his eyes still wide with dread. 

“Yeah,” I assured my father, trying to pay enough 
attention. “Heard them, too.” 

“It was nice of them to show up,” Charlie said. 

“Mm-hmm.” 

Okay, so telling Edward had been a really bad idea. 
Alice was right to keep her thoughts clouded. I should 
have waited till we were alone somewhere, maybe 
with the rest of his family. And nothing breakable 
close by — like windows ... cars ... school buildings. 
His face brought back all my fear and then some. 
Though his expression was past the fear now — it 
was pure fury that was suddenly plain on his 
features. 

“So where do you want to go out for dinner?” Charlie 
asked. “The sky’s the limit.” 

“I can cook.” 

“Don’t be silly. Do you want to go to the Lodge?” he 
asked with an eager smile. 



382 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I did not particularly enjoy Charlie’s favorite 
restaurant, but, at this point, what was the 
difference? I wasn’t going to be able to eat anyway. 

“Sure, the Lodge, cool,” I said. 

Charlie smiled wider, and then sighed. He turned his 
head halfway toward Edward, without really looking 
at him. 

“You coming, too, Edward?” 

I stared at him, my eyes beseeching. Edward pulled 
his expression together just before Charlie turned to 
see why he hadn’t gotten an answer. 

“No, thank you,” Edward said stiffly, his face hard 
and cold. 

“Do you have plans with your parents?” Charlie 
asked, a frown in his voice. Edward was always more 
polite than Charlie deserved; the sudden hostility 
surprised him. 

“Yes. If you’ll excuse me... .” Edward turned abruptly 
and stalked away through the dwindling crowd. He 
moved just a little bit too fast, too upset to keep up 
his usually perfect charade. 

“What did I say?” Charlie asked with a guilty 
expression. 

“Don’t worry about it, Dad,” I reassured him. “I don’t 
think it’s you.” 

“Are you two fighting again?” 

“Nobody’s fighting. Mind your own business.” 



383 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You are my business.” 

I rolled my eyes. “Let’s go eat.” 

The Lodge was crowded. The place was, in my 
opinion, overpriced and tacky, but it was the only 
thing close to a formal restaurant in town, so it was 
always popular for events. I stared morosely at a 
depressed-looking stuffed elk head while Charlie ate 
prime rib and talked over the back of the seat to Tyler 
Crowley’s parents. It was noisy — everyone there had 
just come from graduation, and most were chatting 
across the aisles and over the booth-tops like Charlie. 

I had my back to the front windows, and I resisted the 
urge to turn around and search for the eyes I could 
feel on me now. I knew I wouldn’t be able to see 
anything. Just as I knew there was no chance that he 
would leave me unguarded, even for a second. Not 
after this. 

Dinner dragged. Charlie, busy socializing, ate too 
slowly. I picked at my burger, stuffing pieces of it into 
my napkin when I was sure his attention was 
somewhere else. It all seemed to take a very long time, 
but when I looked at the clock — which I did more 
often than necessary — the hands hadn’t moved 
much. 

Finally Charlie got his change back and put a tip on 
the table. I stood up. 

“In a hurry?” he asked me. 

“I want to help Alice set things up,” I claimed. 

“Okay.” He turned away from me to say goodnight to 
everyone. I went out to wait by the cruiser. 



384 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I leaned against the passenger door, waiting for 
Charlie to drag himself away from the impromptu 
party. It was almost dark in the parking lot, the 
clouds so thick that there was no telling if the sun 
had set or not. The air felt heavy, like it was about to 
rain. 

Something moved in the shadows. 

My gasp turned into a sigh of relief as Edward 
appeared out of the gloom. 

Without a word, he pulled me tightly against his 
chest. One cool hand found my chin, and pulled my 
face up so that he could press his hard lips to mine. I 
could feel the tension in his jaw. 

“How are you?” I asked as soon as he let me breathe. 

“Not so great,” he murmured. “But I’ve got a handle 
on myself. I’m sorry that I lost it back there.” 

“My fault. I should have waited to tell you.” 

“No,” he disagreed. “This is something I needed to 
know. I can’t believe I didn’t see it!” 

“You’ve got a lot on your mind.” 

“And you don’t?” 

He suddenly kissed me again, not letting me answer. 
He pulled away after just a second. “Charlie’s on his 
way.” 

“I’ll have him drop me at your house.” 

“I’ll follow you there.” 



385 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“That’s not really necessary,” I tried to say, but he 
was already gone. 

“Bella?” Charlie called from the doorway of the 
restaurant, squinting into the darkness. 

“I’m out here.” 

Charlie sauntered out to the car, muttering about 
impatience. 

“So, how do you feel?” he asked me as we drove north 
along the highway. “It’s been a big day.” 

“I feel fine,” I lied. 

He laughed, seeing through me easily. “Worried about 
the party?” he guessed. 

“Yeah,” I lied again. 

This time he didn’t notice. “You were never one for the 
parties.” 

“Wonder where I got that from,” I murmured. 

Charlie chuckled. “Well, you look really nice. I wish 
I’d thought to get you something. Sorry.” 

“Don’t be silly, Dad.” 

“It’s not silly. I feel like I don’t always do everything 
for you that I should.” 

“That’s ridiculous. You do a fantastic job. World’s best 
dad. And ...” It wasn’t easy to talk about feelings with 
Charlie, but I persevered after clearing my throat. 

“And I’m really glad I came to live with you, Dad. It 



386 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




was the best idea I ever had. So don’t worry — you’re 
just experiencing post-graduation pessimism.” 



He snorted. “Maybe. But I’m sure I slipped up in a few 
places. I mean, look at your hand!” 

I stared down blankly at my hands. My left hand 
rested lightly on the dark brace I rarely thought 
about. My broken knuckle didn’t hurt much anymore. 

“I never thought I needed to teach you how to throw a 
punch. Guess I was wrong about that.” 

“I thought you were on Jacob’s side?” 

“No matter what side I’m on, if someone kisses you 
without your permission, you should be able to make 
your feelings clear without hurting yourself. You 
didn’t keep your thumb inside your fist, did you?” 

“No, Dad. That’s kind of sweet in a weird way, but I 
don’t think lessons would have helped. Jacob’s head 
is really hard.” 

Charlie laughed. “Hit him in the gut next time.” 

“Next time?” I asked incredulously. 

“Aw, don’t be too hard on the kid. He’s young.” 

“He’s obnoxious.” 

“He’s still your friend.” 

“I know.” I sighed. “I don’t really know what the right 
thing to do here is, Dad.” 

Charlie nodded slowly. “Yeah. The right thing isn’t 
always real obvious. Sometimes the right thing for 

387 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




one person is the wrong thing for someone else. So ... 
good luck figuring that out.” 



“Thanks,” I muttered dryly. 

Charlie laughed again, and then frowned. “If this 
party gets too wild ... ,” he began. 

“Don’t worry about it, Dad. Carlisle and Esme are 
going to be there. I’m sure you can come, too, if you 
want.” 

Charlie grimaced as he squinted through the 
windshield into the night. Charlie enjoyed a good 
party just about as much as I did. 

“Where’s the turnoff, again?” he asked. “They ought to 
clear out their drive — it’s impossible to find in the 
dark.” 

“Just around the next bend, I think.” I pursed my 
lips. “You know, you’re right — it is impossible to 
find. Alice said she put a map in the invitation, but 
even so, maybe everyone will get lost.” I cheered up 
slightly at the idea. 

“Maybe,” Charlie said as the road curved to the east. 
“Or maybe not.” 

The black velvet darkness was interrupted ahead, just 
where the Cullens’ drive should be. Someone had 
wrapped the trees on either side in thousands of 
twinkle lights, impossible to miss. 

“Alice,” I said sourly. 

“Wow,” Charlie said as we turned onto the drive. The 
two trees at the entry weren’t the only ones lit. Every 
twenty feet or so, another shining beacon guided us 

388 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




toward the big white house. All the way — all three 
miles of the way. 

“She doesn’t do things halfway, does she?” Charlie 
mumbled in awe. 

“Sure you don’t want to come in?” 

“Extremely sure. Have fun, kid.” 

“Thanks so much, Dad.” 

He was laughing to himself as I got out and shut the 
door. I watched him drive away, still grinning. With a 
sigh, I marched up the stairs to endure my party.

ALLIANCE 



“Bella?” 

Edward’s soft voice came from behind me. I turned to 
see him spring lightly up the porch steps, his hair 
windblown from running. He pulled me into his arms 
at once, just like he had in the parking lot, and kissed 
me again. 

This kiss frightened me. There was too much tension, 
too strong an edge to the way his lips crushed mine — 
like he was afraid we only had so much time left to 
us. 



I couldn’t let myself think about that. Not if I was 
going to have to act human for the next several hours. 
I pulled away from him. 

“Let’s get this stupid party over with,” I mumbled, not 
meeting his eyes. 

He put his hands on either side of my face, waiting 
until I looked up. 

“I won’t let anything happen to you.” 

I touched his lips with the fingers of my good hand. 
“I’m not worried about myself so much.” 

“Why am I not surprised by that?” he muttered to 
himself. He took a deep breath, and then he smiled 
slightly. “Ready to celebrate?” he asked. 

I groaned. 



390 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



He held the door for me, keeping his arm securely 
around my waist. I stood frozen there for a minute, 
then I slowly shook my head. 

“Unbelievable.” 

Edward shrugged. “Alice will be Alice.” 

The interior of the Cullens’ home had been 
transformed into a nightclub — the kind that didn’t 
often exist in real life, only on TV. 

“Edward!” Alice called from beside a gigantic speaker. 
“I need your advice.” She gestured toward a towering 
stack of CDs. “Should we give them familiar and 
comforting? Or” — she gestured to a different pile — 
“educate their taste in music?” 

“Keep it comforting,” Edward recommended. “You can 
only lead the horse to water.” 

Alice nodded seriously, and started throwing the 
educational CDs into a box. I noticed that she had 
changed into a sequined tank top and red leather 
pants. Her bare skin reacted oddly to the pulsing red 
and purple lights. 

“I think I’m underdressed.” 

“You’re perfect,” Edward disagreed. 

“You’ll do,” Alice amended. 

“Thanks.” I sighed. “Do you really think people will 
come?” Anyone could hear the hope in my voice. Alice 
made a face at me.

“Everyone will come,” Edward answered. “They’re all 
dying to see the inside of the reclusive Cullens’ 
mystery house.” 

“Fabulous,” I moaned. 

There wasn’t anything I could do to help. I doubted 
that — even after I didn’t need sleep and moved at a 
much faster speed — I would ever be able to get 
things done the way Alice did. 

Edward refused to let me go for a second, dragging 
me along with him as he hunted up Jasper and then 
Carlisle to tell them of my epiphany. I listened with 
quiet horror as they discussed their attack on the 
army in Seattle. I could tell that Jasper was not 
pleased with the way the numbers stood, but they’d 
been unable to contact anyone besides Tanya’s 
unwilling family. Jasper didn’t try to hide his 
desperation the way Edward would have. It was easy 
to see that he didn’t like gambling with stakes this 
high. 

I couldn’t stay behind, waiting and hoping for them to 
come home. I wouldn’t. I would go mad. 

The doorbell rang. 

All at once, everything was surreally normal. A perfect 
smile, genuine and warm, replaced the stress on 
Carlisle’s face. Alice turned the volume of the music 
up, and then danced to get the door. 

It was a Suburban-load of my friends, either too 
nervous or too intimidated to arrive on their own. 
Jessica was the first one in the door, with Mike right 
behind her. Tyler, Conner, Austin, Lee, Samantha ... 
even Lauren trailing in last, her critical eyes alight 
with curiosity. They all were curious, and then 
392 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




overwhelmed as they took in the huge room decked 
out like a chic rave. The room wasn’t empty; all the 
Cullens had taken their places, ready to put on their 
usual perfect human charade. Tonight I felt like I was 
acting every bit as much as they were. 

I went to greet Jess and Mike, hoping the edge in my 
voice sounded like the right kind of excitement. 

Before I could get to anyone else, the bell rang again. I 
let Angela and Ben in, leaving the door wide, because 
Eric and Katie were just reaching the steps. 

I didn’t get another chance to panic. I had to talk to 
everyone, concentrate on being upbeat, a hostess. 
Though the party had been billed as a joint event for 
Alice, Edward, and me, there was no denying that I 
was the most popular target for congratulations and 
thanks. Maybe because the Cullens looked just 
slightly wrong under Alice’s party lights. Maybe 
because those lights left the room dim and 
mysterious. Not an atmosphere to make your average 
human feel relaxed when standing next to someone 
like Emmett. I saw Emmett grin at Mike over the food 
table, the red lights gleaming off his teeth, and 
watched Mike take an automatic step back. 

Probably Alice had done this on purpose, to force me 
into the center of attention — a place she thought I 
should enjoy more. She was forever trying to make me 
be human the way she thought humans should be. 

The party was a clear success, despite the instinctive 
edginess cause by the Cullens’ presence — or maybe 
that simply added a thrill to the atmosphere. The 
music was infectious, the lights almost hypnotic. 

From the way the food disappeared, that must have 
been good, too. The room was soon crowded, though 
never claustrophobic. The entire senior class seemed 
to be there, along with most of the juniors. Bodies 
393 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




swayed to the beat that rumbled under the soles of 
their feet, the party constantly on the edge of 
breaking into a dance. 

It wasn’t as hard as I’d thought it would be. I followed 
Alice’s lead, mingling and chatting for a minute with 
everyone. They seemed easy enough to please. I was 
sure this party was far cooler than anything the town 
of Forks had experienced before. Alice was almost 
purring — no one here would forget this night. 

I’d circled the room once, and was back to Jessica. 

She babbled excitedly, and it was not necessary to 
pay strict attention, because the odds were she 
wouldn’t need a response from me anytime soon. 
Edward was at my side — still refusing to let go of me. 
He kept one hand securely at my waist, pulling me 
closer now and then in response to thoughts I 
probably didn’t want to hear. 

So I was immediately suspicious when he dropped his 
arm and edged away from me. 

“Stay here,” he murmured in my ear. “I’ll be right 
back.” 

He passed gracefully through the crowd without 
seeming to touch any of the close-packed bodies, gone 
too quickly for me to ask why he was leaving. I stared 
after him with narrowed eyes while Jessica shouted 
over the music eagerly, hanging on to my elbow, 
oblivious to my distraction. 

I watched him as he reached the dark shadow beside 
the kitchen doorway, where the lights only shone 
intermittently. He was leaning over someone, but I 
couldn’t see past all the heads between us. 



394 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I stretched up on my toes, craning my neck. Right 
then, a red light flashed across his back and glinted 
off the red sequins of Alice’s shirt. The light only 
touched her face for half a second, but it was enough. 

“Excuse me for a minute, Jess,” I mumbled, pulling 
my arm away. I didn’t pause for her reaction, even to 
see if I’d hurt her feelings with my abruptness. 

I ducked my way through the bodies, getting shoved 
around a bit. A few people were dancing now. I 
hurried to the kitchen door. 

Edward was gone, but Alice was still there in the 
dark, her face blank — the kind of expressionless look 
you see on the face of someone who has just 
witnessed a horrible accident. One of her hands 
gripped the door frame, like she needed the support. 

“What, Alice, what? What did you see?” My hands 
were clutched in front of me — begging. 

She didn’t look at me, she was staring away. I 
followed her gaze and watched as she caught 
Edward’s eye across the room. His face was empty as 
a stone. He turned and disappeared into the shadows 
under the stair. 

The doorbell rang just then, hours after the last time, 
and Alice looked up with a puzzled expression that 
quickly turned into one of disgust. 

“Who invited the werewolf?” she griped at me. 

I scowled. “Guilty.” 

I’d thought I’d rescinded that invitation — not that I’d 
ever dreamed Jacob would come here, regardless. 



395 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Well, you go take care of it, then. I have to talk to 
Carlisle.” 



“No, Alice, wait!” I tried to reach for her arm, but she 
was gone and my hand clutched the empty air. 

“Damn it!” I grumbled. 

I knew this was it. Alice had seen what she’d been 
waiting for, and I honestly didn’t feel I could stand the 
suspense long enough to answer the door. The 
doorbell peeled again, too long, someone holding 
down the button. I turned my back toward the door 
resolutely, and scanned the darkened room for Alice. 

I couldn’t see anything. I started pushing for the 
stairs. 

“Hey, Bella!” 

Jacob’s deep voice caught a lull in the music, and I 
looked up in spite of myself at the sound of my name. 

I made a face. 

It wasn’t just one werewolf, it was three. Jacob had let 
himself in, flanked on either side by Quil and Embry. 
The two of them looked terribly tense, their eyes 
flickering around the room like they’d just walked into 
a haunted crypt. Embry’s trembling hand still held 
the door, his body half-turned to run for it. 

Jacob was waving at me, calmer than the others, 
though his nose was wrinkled in disgust. I waved 
back — waved goodbye — and turned to look for 
Alice. I squeezed through a space between Conner’s 
and Lauren’s backs. 



396 | P a g e

He came out of nowhere, his hand on my shoulder 
pulling me back toward the shadow by the kitchen. I 
ducked under his grip, but he grabbed my good wrist 
and yanked me from the crowd. 

“Friendly reception,” he noted. 

I pulled my hand free and scowled at him. “What are 
you doing here?” 

“You invited me, remember?” 

“In case my right hook was too subtle for you, let me 
translate: that was me uninviting you.” 

“Don’t be a poor sport. I brought you a graduation 
present and everything.” 

I folded my arms across my chest. I didn’t want to 
fight with Jacob right now. I wanted to know what 
Alice had seen and what Edward and Carlisle were 
saying about it. I craned my head around Jacob, 
searching for them. 

“Take it back to the store, Jake. I’ve got to do 
something... .” 

He stepped into my line of sight, demanding my 
attention. 

“I can’t take it back. I didn’t get it from the store — I 
made it myself. Took a really long time, too.” 

I leaned around him again, but I couldn’t see any of 
the Cullens. Where had they gone? My eyes scanned 
the darkened room. 

“Oh, c’mon, Bell. Don’t pretend like I’m not here!” 



397 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




‘Tm not.” I couldn’t see them anywhere. “Look, Jake, 
I’ve got a lot on my mind right now.” 

He put his hand under my chin and pulled my face 
up. “Could I please have just a few seconds of your 
undivided attention, Miss Swan?” 

I jerked away from his touch. “Keep your hands to 
yourself, Jacob,” I hissed. 

“Sorry!” he said at once, holding his hands up in 
surrender. “I really am sorry. About the other day, I 
mean, too. I shouldn’t have kissed you like that. It 
was wrong. I guess ... well, I guess I deluded myself 
into thinking you wanted me to.” 

“Deluded — what a perfect description!” 

“Be nice. You could accept my apology, you know.” 

“Fine. Apology accepted. Now, if you’ll just excuse me 
for a moment ...” 

“Okay,” he mumbled, and his voice was so different 
from before that I stoppd searching for Alice and 
scrutinized his face. He was staring at the floor, 
hiding his eyes. His lower lip jutted out just a little 
bit. 

“I guess you’d rather be with your real friends,” he 
said in the same defeated tone. “I get it.” 

I groaned. “Aw, Jake, you know that’s not fair.” 

“Do I?” 

“You should.” I leaned forward, peering up, trying to 
look into his eyes. He looked up then, over my head, 
avoiding my gaze. 

398 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Jake?” 



He refused to look at me. 

“Hey, you said you made me something, right?” I 
asked. “Was that just talk? Where’s my present?” My 
attempt to fake enthusiasm was pretty sad, but it 
worked. He rolled his eyes and then grimaced at me. 

I kept up the lame pretense, holding my hand open in 
front of me. “I’m waiting.” 

“Right,” he grumbled sarcastically. But he also 
reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled 
out a small bag of a loose-woven, multi-colored fabric. 
It was tied shut with leather drawstrings. He set it on 
my palm. 

“Hey, that’s pretty, Jake. Thanks!” 

He sighed. “The present is inside, Bella.” 

“Oh.” 

I had some trouble with the strings. He sighed again 
and took it from me, sliding the ties open with one 
easy tug of the right cord. I held my hand out for it, 
but he turned the bag upside down and shook 
something silver into my hand. Metal links clinked 
quietly against each other. 

“I didn’t make the bracelet,” he admitted. “Just the 
charm.” 

Fastened to one of the links of the silver bracelet was 
a tiny wooden carving. I held it between my fingers to 
look at it closer. It was amazing the amount of detail 
involved in the little figurine — the miniature wolf was 



399 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




utterly realistic. It was even carved out of some red- 
brown wood that matched the color of his skin. 

“It’s beautiful,” I whispered. “You made this? How?” 

He shrugged. “It’s something Billy taught me. He’s 
better at it than I am.” 

“That’s hard to believe,” I murmured, turning the tiny 
wolf around and around in my fingers. 

“Do you really like it?” 

“Yes! It’s unbelievable, Jake.” 

He smiled, happily at first, but then the expression 
soured. “Well, I figured that maybe it would make you 
remember me once in a while. You know how it is, out 
of sight, out of mind.” 

I ignored the attitude. “Here, help me put it on.” 

I held out my left wrist, since the right was stuck in 
the brace. He fastened the catch easily, though it 
looked too delicate for his big fingers to manage. 

“You’ll wear it?” he asked. 

“Of course I will.” 

He grinned at me — it was the happy smile that I 
loved to see him wear. 

I returned it for a moment, but then my eyes shot 
reflexively around the room again, anxiously scanning 
the crowd for some sign of Edward or Alice. 

“Why ’re you so distracted?” Jacob wondered. 



400 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“It’s nothing,” I lied, trying to concentrate. “Thanks for 
the present, really. I love it.” 



“Bella?” His brows pulled together, throwing his eyes 
deep into their shadow. “Something’s going on, isn’t 



it?” 



“Jake, I ... no, there’s nothing.” 

“Don’t lie to me, you suck at lying. You should tell me 
what’s going on. We want to know these things,” he 
said, slipping into the plural at the end. 

He was probably right; the wolves would certainly be 
interested in what was happening. Only I wasn’t sure 
what that was yet. I wouldn’t know for sure until I 
found Alice. 

“Jacob, I will tell you. Just let me figure out what’s 
happening, okay? I need to talk to Alice.” 

Understanding lit his expression. “The psychic saw 
something.” 

“Yes, just when you showed up.” 

“Is this about the bloodsucker in your room?” he 
murmured, pitching his voice below the thrum of the 
music. 

“It’s related,” I admitted. 

He processed that for a minute, leaning his head to 
one side while he read my face. “You know something 
you’re not telling me ... something big.” 

What was the point in lying again? He knew me too 
well. “Yes.” 



401 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jacob stared at me for one short moment, and then 
turned to catch his pack brothers’ eyes where they 
stood in the entry, awkward and uncomfortable. 

When they took in his expression, they started 
moving, weaving their way agilely through the 
partiers, almost like they were dancing, too. In half a 
minute, they stood on either side of Jacob, towering 
over me. 

“Now. Explain,” Jacob demanded. 

Embry and Quil looked back and forth between our 
faces, confused and wary. 

“Jacob, I don’t know everything.” I kept searching the 
room, now for a rescue. They had me backed into a 
corner in every sense. 

“What you do know, then.” 

They all folded their arms across their chests at 
exactly the same moment. It was a little bit funny, but 
mostly menacing. 

And then I caught sight of Alice descending the stairs, 
her white skin glowing in the purple light. 

“Alice!” I squeaked in relief. 

She looked right at me as soon as I called her name, 
despite the thudding bass that should have drowned 
my voice. I waved eagerly, and watched her face as 
she took in the three werewolves leaning over me. Her 
eyes narrowed. 

But, before that reaction, her face was full of stress 
and fear. I bit my lip as she skipped to my side. 



402 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jacob, Quil, and Embry all leaned away from her with 
uneasy expressions. She put her arm around my 
waist. 

“I need to talk to you,” she murmured into my ear. 

“Er, Jake, I’ll see you later ... ,” I mumbled as we 
eased around them. 

Jacob threw his long arm out to block our way, 
bracing his hand against the wall. “Hey, not so fast.” 

Alice stared up at him, eyes wide and incredulous. 
“Excuse me?” 

“Tell us what’s going on,” he demanded in a growl. 

Jasper appeared quite literally out of nowhere. One 
second it was just Alice and me against the wall, 
Jacob blocking our exit, and then Jasper was 
standing on the other side of Jake’s arm, his 
expression terrifying. 

Jacob slowly pulled his arm back. It seemed like the 
best move, going with the assumption that he wanted 
to keep that arm. 

“We have a right to know,” Jacob muttered, still 
glaring at Alice. 

Jasper stepped in between them, and the three 
werewolves braced themselves. 

“Hey, hey,” I said, adding a slightly hysterical 
chuckle. “This is a party, remember?” 

Nobody paid any attention to me. Jacob glared at 
Alice while Jasper glowered at Jacob. Alice’s face was 
suddenly thoughtful. 

403 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“It’s okay, Jasper. He actually has a point.” 

Jasper did not relax his position. 

I was sure the suspense was going to make my head 
explode in about one second. “What did you see, 
Alice?” 

She stared at Jacob for one second, and then turned 
to me, evidently having chosen to let them hear. 

“The decision’s been made.” 

“You’re going to Seattle?” 

“No.” 

I felt the color drain out of my face. My stomach 
lurched. “They’re coming here,” I choked out. 

The Quileute boys watched silently, reading every 
unconscious play of emotion on our faces. They were 
rooted in place, and yet not completely still. All three 
pairs of hands were trembling. 

“Yes.” 

“To Forks,” I whispered. 

“Yes.” 

“For?” 

She nodded, understanding my question. “One 
carried your red shirt.” 

I tried to swallow. 



404 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jasper’s expression was disapproving. I could tell he 
didn’t like discussing this in front of the werewolves, 
but he had something he needed to say. “We can’t let 
them come that far. There aren’t enough of us to 
protect the town.” 

“I know,” Alice said, her face suddenly desolate. “But 
it doesn’t matter where we stop them. There still won’t 
be enough of us, and some of them will come here to 
search.” 

“No!” I whispered. 

The noise of the party overwhelmed the sound of my 
denial. All around us, my friends and neighbors and 
petty enemies ate and laughed and swayed to the 
music, oblivious to the fact that they were about to 
face horror, danger, maybe death. Because of me. 

“Alice,” I mouthed her name. “I have to go, I have to 
get away from here.” 

“That won’t help. It’s not like we’re dealing with a 
tracker. They’ll still come looking here first.” 

“Then I have to go to meet them!” If my voice hadn’t 
been so hoarse and strained, it might have been a 
shriek. “If they find what they’re looking for, maybe 
they’ll go away and not hurt anyone else!” 

“Bella!” Alice protested. 

“Hold it,” Jacob ordered in a low, forceful voice. “What 
is coming?” 

Alice turned her icy gaze on him. “Our kind. Lots of 
them.” 

“Why?” 

405 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“For Bella. That’s all we know.” 



“There are too many for you?” he asked. 

Jasper bridled. “We have a few advantages, dog. It will 
be an even fight.” 

“No,” Jacob said, and a strange, fierce half-smile 
spread across his face. “It won’t be even.” 

“Excellent!” Alice hissed. 

I stared, still frozen in horror, at Alice’s new 
expression. Her face was alive with exultation, all the 
despair wiped clean from her perfect features. 

She grinned at Jacob, and he grinned back. 

“Everything just disappeared, of course,” she told him 
in a smug voice. “That’s inconvenient, but, all things 
considered, I’ll take it.” 

“Well have to coordinate,” Jacob said. “It won’t be 
easy for us. Still, this is our job more than yours.” 

“I wouldn’t go that far, but we need the help. We 
aren’t going to be picky.” 

“Wait, wait, wait, wait,” I interrupted them. 

Alice was on her toes, Jacob leaning down toward 
her, both of their faces lit up with excitement, both of 
their noses wrinkled against the smell. They looked at 
me impatiently. 

“Coordinate?” I repeated through my teeth. 

“You didn’t honestly think you were going to keep us 
out of this?” Jacob asked. 

406 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You are staying out of this!” 

“Your psychic doesn’t think so.” 

“Alice — tell them no!” I insisted. “They’ll get killed!” 

Jacob, Quil, and Embry all laughed out loud. 

“Bella,” Alice said, her voice soothing, placating, 
“separately we all could get killed. Together — ” 

“It’ll be no problem,” Jacob finished her sentence. 

Quil laughed again. 

“How many?” Quil asked eagerly. 

“No!” I shouted. 

Alice didn’t even look at me. “It changes — twenty-one 
today, but the numbers are going down.” 

“Why?” Jacob asked, curious. 

“Long story,” Alice said, suddenly looking around the 
room. “And this isn’t the place for it.” 

“Later tonight?” Jacob pushed. 

“Yes,” Jasper answered him. “We were already 
planning a ... strategic meeting. If you’re going to fight 
with us, you’ll need some instruction.” 

The wolves all made a disgruntled face at the last 
part. 

“No!” I moaned. 

“This will be odd,” Jasper said thoughtfully. “I never 
considered working together. This has to be a first.” 

407 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“No doubt about that,” Jacob agreed. He was in a 
hurry now. “We’ve got to get back to Sam. What 
time?” 

“What’s too late for you?” 

All three rolled their eyes. “What time?” Jacob 
repeated. 

“Three o’clock?” 

“Where?” 

“About ten miles due north of the Hoh Forest ranger 
station. Come at it from the west and you’ll be able to 
follow our scent in.” 

“Well be there.” 

They turned to leave. 

“Wait, Jake!” I called after him. “Please! Don’t do 
this!” 

He paused, turning back to grin at me, while Quil and 
Embry headed impatiently for the door. “Don’t be 
ridiculous, Bells. You’re giving me a much better gift 
than the one I gave you.” 

“No!” I shouted again. The sound of an electric guitar 
drowned my cry. 

He didn’t respond; he hurried to catch up with his 
friends, who were already gone. I watched helplessly 
as Jacob disappeared.

INSTRUCTION 




“That had to be the longest party in the history of the 
world,” I complained on the way home. 

Edward didn’t seem to disagree. “It’s over now,” he 
said, rubbing my arm soothingly. 

Because I was the only one who needed soothing. 
Edward was fine now — all the Cullens were fine. 

They’d all reassured me; Alice reaching up to pat my 
head as I left, eyeing Jasper meaningfully until a flood 
of peace swirled around me, Esme kissing my 
forehead and promising me everything was all right, 
Emmett laughing boisterously and asking why I was 
the only one who was allowed to fight with 
werewolves... . Jacob’s solution had them all relaxed, 
almost euphoric after the long weeks of stress. Doubt 
had been replaced with confidence. The party had 
ended on a note of true celebration. 

Not for me. 

Bad enough — horrible — that the Cullens would 
fight for me. It was already too much that I would 
have to allow that. It already felt like more than I 
could bear. 

Not Jacob, too. Not his foolish, eager brothers — most 
of them even younger than I was. They were just 
oversized, over-muscled children, and they looked 
forward to this like it was picnic on the beach. I could 
not have them in danger, too. My nerves felt frayed 
and exposed. I didn’t know how much longer I could 
restrain the urge to scream out loud. 

409 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



I whispered now, to keep my voice under control. 
“You’re taking me with you tonight.” 



“Bella, you’re worn out.” 

“You think I could sleep?” 

He frowned. “This is an experiment. I’m not sure if it 
will be possible for us all to ... cooperate. I don’t want 
you in the middle of that.” 

As if that didn’t make me all the more anxious to go. 
“If you won’t take me, then I’ll call Jacob.” 

His eyes tightened. That was a low blow, and I knew 
it. But there was no way I was being left behind. 

He didn’t answer; we were at Charlie’s house now. 

The front light was on. 

“See you upstairs,” I muttered. 

I tiptoed in the front door. Charlie was asleep in the 
living room, overflowing the too-small sofa, and 
snoring so loudly I could have ripped a chainsaw to 
life and it wouldn’t have wakened him. 

I shook his shoulder vigorously. 

“Dad! Charlie!” 

He grumbled, eyes still closed. 

“I’m home now — you’re going to hurt your back 
sleeping like that. C’mon, time to move.” 

It took a few more shakes, and his eyes never did 
open all the way, but I managed to get him off the 
couch. I helped him up to his bed, where he collapsed 

410 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




on top of the covers, fully dressed, and started 
snoring again. 



He wasn’t going to be looking for me anytime soon. 

Edward waited in my room while I washed my face 
and changed into jeans and a flannel shirt. He 
watched me unhappily from the rocking chair as I 
hung the outfit Alice had given me in my closet. 

“Come here,” I said, taking his hand and pulling him 
to my bed. 

I pushed him down on the bed and then curled up 
against his chest. Maybe he was right and I was tired 
enough to sleep. I wasn’t going to let him sneak off 
without me. 

He tucked my quilt in around me, and then held me 
close. 

“Please relax.” 

“Sure.” 

“This is going to work, Bella. I can feel it.” 

My teeth locked together. 

He was still radiating relief. Nobody but me cared if 
Jacob and his friends got hurt. Not even Jacob and 
his friends. Especially not them. 

He could tell I was about to lose it. “Listen to me, 

Bella. This is going to be easy. The newborns will be 
completely taken by surprise. They’ll have no more 
idea that werewolves even exist than you did. I’ve 
seen how they act in a group, the way Jasper 
remembers. I truly believe that the wolves’ hunting 
411 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




techniques will work flawlessly against them. And 
with them divided and confused, there won’t be 
enough for the rest of us to do. Someone may have to 
sit out,” he teased. 

“Piece of cake,” I mumbled tonelessly against his 
chest. 

“Shhh,” he stroked my cheek. “You’ll see. Don’t worry 
now.” 

He started humming my lullaby, but, for once, it 
didn’t calm me. 

People — well, vampires and werewolves really, but 
still — people I loved were going to get hurt. Hurt 
because of me. Again. I wished my bad luck would 
focus a little more carefully. I felt like yelling up at the 
empty sky: It’s me you want — over here! Just me! 

I tried to think of a way that I could do exactly that — 
force my bad luck to focus on me. It wouldn’t be easy. 

I would have to wait, bide my time... . 

I did not fall asleep. The minutes passed quickly, to 
my surprise, and I was still alert and tense when 
Edward pulled us both up into a sitting position. 

“Are you sure you don’t want to stay and sleep?” 

I gave him a sour look. 

He sighed, and scooped me up in his arms before he 
jumped from my window. 

He raced through the black, quiet forest with me on 
his back, and even in his run I could feel the elation. 
He ran the way he did when it was just us, just for 
enjoyment, just for the feel of the wind in his hair. It 

412 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




was the kind of thing that, during less anxious times, 
would have made me happy. 



When we got to the big open field, his family was 
there, talking casually, relaxed. Emmett’s booming 
laugh echoed through the wide space now and then. 
Edward set me down and we walked hand in hand 
toward them. 

It took me a minute, because it was so dark with the 
moon hidden behind the clouds, but I realized that we 
were in the baseball clearing. It was the same place 
where, more than a year ago, that first lighthearted 
evening with the Cullens had been interrupted by 
James and his coven. It felt strange to be here again 
— as if this gathering wouldn’t be complete until 
James and Laurent and Victoria joined us. But James 
and Laurent were never coming back. That pattern 
wouldn’t be repeated. Maybe all the patterns were 
broken. 

Yes, someone had broken out of their pattern. Was it 
possible that the Volturi were the flexible ones in this 
equation? 

I doubted it. 

Victoria had always seemed like a force of nature to 
me — like a hurricane moving toward the coast in a 
straight line — unavoidable, implacable, but 
predictable. Maybe it was wrong to limit her that way. 
She had to be capable of adaptation. 

“You know what I think?” I asked Edward. 

He laughed. “No.” 

I almost smiled. 



413 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“What do you think?” 



“I think it’s all connected. Not just the two, but all 
three.” 

“You’ve lost me.” 

“Three bad things have happened since you came 
back.” I ticked them off on my fingers. “The newborns 
in Seattle. The stranger in my room. And — first of all 
— Victoria came to look for me.” 

His eyes narrowed as he thought about it. “Why do 
you think so?” 

“Because I agree with Jasper — the Volturi love their 
rules. They would probably do a better job anyway.” 
And I’d be dead if they wanted me dead, I added 
mentally. “Remember when you were tracking Victoria 
last year?” 

“Yes.” He frowned. “I wasn’t very good at it.” 

“Alice said you were in Texas. Did you follow her 
there?” 

His eyebrows pulled together. “Yes. Hmm ...” 

“See — she could have gotten the idea there. But she 
doesn’t know what she’s doing, so the newborns are 
all out of control.” 

He started shaking his head. “Only Aro knows exactly 
how Alice’s visions work.” 

“Aro would know best, but wouldn’t Tanya and Irina 
and the rest of your friends in Denali know enough? 
Laurent lived with them for so long. And if he was still 
friendly enough with Victoria to be doing favors for 

414 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




her, why wouldn’t he also tell her everything he 
knew?” 

Edward frowned. “It wasn’t Victoria in your room.” 

“She can’t make new friends? Think about it, Edward. 
If it is Victoria doing this in Seattle, she’s made a lot 
of new friends. She’s created them.” 

He considered it, his forehead creased in 
concentration. 

“Hmm,” he finally said. “It’s possible. I still think the 
Volturi are most likely ... But your theory — there’s 
something there. Victoria’s personality. Your theory 
suits her personality perfectly. She’s shown a 
remarkable gift for self-preservation from the start — 
maybe it’s a talent of hers. In any case, this plot 
would put her in no danger at all from us, if she sits 
safely behind and lets the newborns wreak their 
havoc here. And maybe little danger from the Volturi, 
either. Perhaps she’s counting on us to win, in the 
end, though certainly not without heavy casualties of 
our own. But no survivors from her little army to bear 
witness against her. In fact,” he continued, thinking it 
through, “if there were survivors, I’d bet she’d be 
planning to destroy them herself... . Hmm. Still, she’d 
have to have at least one friend who was a bit more 
mature. No fresh-made newborn left your father 
alive... .” 

He frowned into space for a long moment, and then 
suddenly smiled at me, coming back from his reverie. 
“Definitely possible. Regardless, we’ve got to be 
prepared for anything until we know for sure. You’re 
very perceptive today,” he added. “It’s impressive.” 



415 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I sighed. “Maybe I’m just reacting to this place. It 
makes me feel like she’s close by ... like she sees me 
now.” 

His jaw muscles tensed at the idea. “She’ll never 
touch you, Bella,” he said. 

In spite of his words, his eyes swept carefully across 
the dark trees. While he searched their shadows, the 
strangest expression crossed his face. His lips pulled 
back over his teeth and his eyes shone with an odd 
light — a wild, fierce kind of hope. 

“Yet, what I wouldn’t give to have her that close,” he 
murmured. “Victoria, and anyone else who’s ever 
thought of hurting you. To have the chance to end 
this myself. To finish it with my own hands this time.” 

I shuddered at the ferocious longing in his voice, and 
clenched his fingers more tightly with mine, wishing I 
was strong enough to lock our hands together 
permanently. 

We were almost to his family, and I noticed for the 
first time that Alice did not look as optimistic as the 
others. She stood a little aside, watching Jasper 
stretching his arms as if he were warming up to 
exercise, her lips pushed out in a pout. 

“Is something wrong with Alice?” I whispered. 

Edward chuckled, himself again. “The werewolves are 
on their way, so she can’t see anything that will 
happen now. It makes her uncomfortable to be blind.” 

Alice, though the farthest from us, heard his low 
voice. She looked up and stuck her tongue out at 
him. He laughed again. 



416 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Hey, Edward,” Emmett greeted him. “Hey, Bella. Is 
he going to let you practice, too?” 

Edward groaned at his brother. “Please, Emmett, 
don’t give her any ideas.” 

“When will our guests arrive?” Carlisle asked Edward. 

Edward concentrated for a moment, and then sighed. 
“A minute and a half. But I’m going to have to 
translate. They don’t trust us enough to use their 
human forms.” 

Carlisle nodded. “This is hard for them. I’m grateful 
they’re coming at all.” 

I stared at Edward, my eyes stretched wide. “They’re 
coming as wolves?” 

He nodded, cautious of my reaction. I swallowed once, 
remembering the two times I’d seen Jacob in his wolf 
form — the first time in the meadow with Laurent, the 
second time on the forest lane where Paul had gotten 
angry at me... . They were both memories of terror. 

A strange gleam came into Edward’s eyes, as though 
something had just occurred to him, something that 
was not altogether unpleasant. He turned away 
quickly, before I could see any more, back to Carlisle 
and the others. 

“Prepare yourselves — they’ve been holding out on 
us.” 



“What do you mean?” Alice demanded. 

“Shh,” he cautioned, and stared past her into the 
darkness. 



417 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




The Cullens’ informal circle suddenly widened out 
into a loose line with Jasper and Emmett at the spear 
point. From the way Edward leaned forward next to 
me, I could tell that he wished he was standing beside 
them. I tightened my hand around his. 

I squinted toward the forest, seeing nothing. 

“Damn,” Emmett muttered under his breath. “Did you 
ever see anything like it?” 

Esme and Rosalie exchanged a wide-eyed glance. 

“What is it?” I whispered as quietly as I could. “I can’t 
see.” 

“The pack has grown,” Edward murmured into my 
ear. 

Hadn’t I told him that Quil had joined the pack? I 
strained to see the six wolves in the gloom. Finally, 
something glittered in the blackness — their eyes, 
higher up than they should be. I’d forgotten how very 
tall the wolves were. Like horses, only thick with 
muscle and fur — and teeth like knives, impossible to 
overlook. 

I could only see the eyes. And as I scanned, straining 
to see more, it occurred to me that there were more 
than six pairs facing us. One, two, three ... I counted 
the pairs swiftly in my head. Twice. 

There were ten of them. 

“Fascinating,” Edward murmured almost silently. 

Carlisle took a slow, deliberate step forward. It was a 
careful movement, designed to reassure. 



418 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Welcome,” he greeted the invisible wolves. 



“Thank you,” Edward responded in a strange, flat 
tone, and I realized at once that the words came from 
Sam. I looked to the eyes shining in the center of the 
line, the highest up, the tallest of them all. It was 
impossible to separate the shape of the big black wolf 
from the darkness. 

Edward spoke again in the same detached voice, 
speaking Sam’s words. “We will watch and listen, but 
no more. That is the most we can ask of our self- 
control.” 

“That is more than enough,” Carlisle answered. “My 
son Jasper” — he gestured to where Jasper stood, 
tensed and ready — “has experience in this area. He 
will teach us how they fight, how they are to be 
defeated. I’m sure you can apply this to your own 
hunting style.” 

“They are different from you?” Edward asked for Sam. 

Carlisle nodded. “They are all very new — only 
months old to this life. Children, in a way. They will 
have no skill or strategy, only brute strength. Tonight 
their numbers stand at twenty. Ten for us, ten for you 
— it shouldn’t be difficult. The numbers may go 
down. The new ones fight amongst themselves.” 

A rumble passed down the shadowy line of wolves, a 
low growling mutter that somehow managed to sound 
enthusiastic. 

“We are willing to take more than our share, if 
necessary,” Edward translated, his tone less 
indifferent now. 

Carlisle smiled. “We’ll see how it plays out.” 

419 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Do you know when and how they’ll arrive?” 

“They’ll come across the mountains in four days, in 
the late morning. As they approach, Alice will help us 
intercept their path.” 

“Thank you for the information. We will watch.” 

With a sighing sound, the eyes sank closer to the 
ground one set at a time. 

It was silent for two heartbeats, and then Jasper took 
a step into the empty space between the vampires 
and the wolves. It wasn’t hard for me to see him — 
his skin was as bright against the darkness as the 
wolves’ eyes. Jasper threw a wary glance toward 
Edward, who nodded, and then Jasper turned his 
back to the werewolves. He sighed, clearly 
uncomfortable . 

“Carlisle’s right.” Jasper spoke only to us; he seemed 
to be trying to ignore the audience behind him. 
“They’ll fight like children. The two most important 
things you’ll need to remember are, first, don’t let 
them get their arms around you and, second, don’t go 
for the obvious kill. That’s all they’ll be prepared for. 
As long as you come at them from the side and keep 
moving, they’ll be too confused to respond effectively. 
Emmett?” 

Emmett stepped out of the line with a huge smile. 

Jasper backed toward the north end of the opening 
between the allied enemies. He waved Emmett 
forward. 

“Okay, Emmett first. He’s the best example of a 
newborn attack.” 



420 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Emmett’s eyes narrowed. “I’ll try not to break 
anything,” he muttered. 

Jasper grinned. “What I meant is that Emmett relies 
on his strength. He’s very straightforward about the 
attack. The newborns won’t be trying anything subtle, 
either. Just go for the easy kill, Emmett.” 

Jasper backed up a few more paces, his body tensing. 

“Okay, Emmett — try to catch me.” 

And I couldn’t see Jasper anymore — he was a blur 
as Emmett charged him like a bear, grinning while he 
snarled. Emmett was impossibly quick, too, but not 
like Jasper. It looked like Jasper had no more 
substance than a ghost — any time it seemed 
Emmett’s big hands had him for sure, Emmett’s 
fingers clenched around nothing but the air. Beside 
me, Edward leaned forward intently, his eyes locked 
on the brawl. Then Emmett froze. 

Jasper had him from behind, his teeth an inch from 
his throat. 

Emmett cussed. 

There was a muttered rumble of appreciation from the 
watching wolves. 

“Again,” Emmett insisted, his smile gone. 

“It’s my turn,” Edward protested. My fingers tensed 
around his. 

“In a minute.” Jasper grinned, stepping back. “I want 
to show Bella something first.” 



421 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I watched with anxious eyes as he waved Alice 
forward. 



“I know you worry about her,” he explained to me as 
she danced blithely into the ring. “I want to show you 
why that’s not necessary.” 

Though I knew that Jasper would never allow any 
harm to come to Alice, it was still hard to watch as he 
sank back into a crouch facing her. Alice stood 
motionlessly, looking tiny as a doll after Emmett, 
smiling to herself. Jasper shifted forward, then 
slinked to her left. 

Alice closed her eyes. 

My heart thumped unevenly as Jasper stalked toward 
where Alice stood. 

Jasper sprang, disappearing. Suddenly he was on the 
other side of Alice. She didn’t appear to have moved. 

Jasper wheeled and launched himself at her again, 
only to land in a crouch behind her like the first time; 
all the while Alice stood smiling with her eyes closed. 

I watched Alice more carefully now. 

She was moving — I’d just been missing it, distracted 
by Jasper’s attacks. She took a small step forward at 
the exact second that Jasper’s body flew through the 
spot where she’d just been standing. She took 
another step, while Jasper’s grasping hands whistled 
past where her waist had been. 

Jasper closed in, and Alice began to move faster. She 
was dancing — spiraling and twisting and curling in 
on herself. Jasper was her partner, lunging, reaching 
through her graceful patterns, never touching her, 

422 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




like every movement was choreographed. Finally, 
Alice laughed. 



Out of nowhere she was perched on Jasper’s back, 
her lips at his neck. 

“Gotcha,” she said, and kissed his throat. 

Jasper chuckled, shaking his head. “You truly are one 
frightening little monster.” 

The wolves muttered again. This time the sound was 
wary. 

“It’s good for them to learn some respect,” Edward 
murmured, amused. Then he spoke louder. “My 
turn.” 

He squeezed my hand before he let it go. 

Alice came to take his place beside me. “Cool, huh?” 
she asked me smugly. 

“Very,” I agreed, not looking away from Edward as he 
glided noiselessly toward Jasper, his movements lithe 
and watchful as a jungle cat. 

“I’ve got my eye on you, Bella,” she whispered 
suddenly, her voice pitched so low that I could barely 
hear, though her lips were at my ear. 

My gaze flickered to her face and then back to 
Edward. He was intent on Jasper, both of them 
feinting as he closed the distance. 

Alice’s expression was full of reproach. 

“I’ll warn him if your plans get any more defined,” she 
threatened in the same low murmur. “It doesn’t help 

423 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




anything for you to put yourself in danger. Do you 
think either of them would give up if you died? They’d 
still fight, we all would. You can’t change anything, so 
just be good, okay?” 

I grimaced, trying to ignore her. 

“I’m watching,” she repeated. 

Edward had closed on Jasper now, and this fight was 
more even than either of the others. Jasper had the 
century of experience to guide him, and he tried to go 
on instinct alone as much as he could, but his 
thoughts always gave him away a fraction of a second 
before he acted. Edward was slightly faster, but the 
moves Jasper used were unfamiliar to him. They 
came at each other again and again, neither one able 
to gain the advantage, instinctive snarls erupting 
constantly. It was hard to watch, but harder to look 
away. They moved too fast for me to really understand 
what they were doing. Now and then the sharp eyes of 
the wolves would catch my attention. I had a feeling 
the wolves were getting more out of this than I was — 
maybe more than they should. 

Eventually, Carlisle cleared his throat. 

Jasper laughed, and took a step back. Edward 
straightened up and grinned at him. 

“Back to work,” Jasper consented. “We’ll call it a 
draw.” 

Everyone took turns, Carlisle, then Rosalie, Esme, 
and Emmett again. I squinted through my lashes, 
cringing as Jasper attacked Esme. That one was the 
hardest to watch. Then he slowed down, still not quite 
enough for me to understand his motions, and gave 
more instruction. 

424 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You see what I’m doing here?” he would ask. “Yes, 
just like that,” he encouraged. “Concentrate on the 
sides. Don’t forget where their target will be. Keep 
moving.” 

Edward was always focused, watching and also 
listening to what others couldn’t see. 

It got more difficult to follow as my eyes got heavier. I 
hadn’t been sleeping well lately, anyway, and it was 
approaching a solid twenty-four hours since the last 
time I’d slept. I leaned against Edward’s side, and let 
my eyelids droop. 

“We’re about finished,” he whispered. 

Jasper confirmed that, turning toward the wolves for 
the first time, his expression uncomfortable again. 
“Well be doing this tomorrow. Please feel welcome to 
observe again.” 

“Yes,” Edward answered in Sam’s cool voice. “We’ll be 
here.” 

Then Edward sighed, patted my arm, and stepped 
away from me. He turned to his family. 

“The pack thinks it would be helpful to be familiar 
with each of our scents — so they don’t make 
mistakes later. If we could hold very still, it will make 
it easier for them.” 

“Certainly,” Carlisle said to Sam. “Whatever you 
need.” 

There was a gloomy, throaty grumble from the wolf 
pack as they all rose to their feet. 



My eyes were wide again, exhaustion forgotten. 

425 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




The deep black of the night was just beginning to fade 
— the sun brightening the clouds, though it hadn’t 
cleared the horizon yet, far away on the other side of 
the mountains. As they approached, it was suddenly 
possible to make out shapes ... colors. 

Sam was in the lead, of course. Unbelievably huge, 
black as midnight, a monster straight out of my 
nightmares — literally; after the first time I’d seen 
Sam and the others in the meadow, they’d starred in 
my bad dreams more than once. 

Now that I could see them all, match the vastness 
with each pair of eyes, it looked like more than ten. 
The pack was overwhelming. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw that Edward was 
watching me, carefully evaluating my reaction. 

Sam approached Carlisle where he stood in the front, 
the huge pack right on his tail. Jasper stiffened, but 
Emmett, on the other side of Carlisle, was grinning 
and relaxed. 

Sam sniffed at Carlisle, seeming to wince slightly as 
he did. Then he moved on to Jasper. 

My eyes ran down the wary brace of wolves. I was 
sure I could pick out a few of the new additions. 

There was a light gray wolf that was much smaller 
than the others, the hackles on the back of his neck 
raised in distaste. There was another, the color of 
desert sand, who seemed gangly and uncoordinated 
beside the rest. A low whine broke through the sandy 
wolf’s control when Sam’s advance left him isolated 
between Carlisle and Jasper. 

I stopped at the wolf just behind Sam. His fur was 
reddish-brown and longer than the others, shaggy in 

426 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




comparison. He was almost as tall as Sam, the 
second largest in the group. His stance was casual, 
somehow exuding nonchalance over what the rest 
obviously considered an ordeal. 

The enormous russet-colored wolf seemed to feel my 
gaze, and he looked up at me with familiar black eyes. 

I stared back at him, trying to believe what I already 
knew. I could feel the wonder and fascination on my 
face. 

The wolfs muzzle fell open, pulling back over his 
teeth. It would have been a frightening expression, 
except that his tongue lolled out the side in a wolfy 
grin. 

I giggled. 

Jacob’s grin widened over his sharp teeth. He left his 
place in line, ignoring the eyes of his pack as they 
followed him. He trotted past Edward and Alice to 
stand not two feet away from me. He stopped there, 
his gaze flickering briefly toward Edward. 

Edward stood motionless, a statue, his eyes still 
assessing my reaction. 

Jacob crouched down on his front legs and dropped 
his head so that his face was no higher than mine, 
staring at me, measuring my response just as much 
as Edward was. 

“Jacob?” I breathed. 

The answering rumble deep in his chest sounded like 
a chuckle. 



427 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I reached my hand out, my fingers trembling slightly, 
and touched the red-brown fur on the side of his face. 

The black eyes closed, and Jacob leaned his huge 
head into my hand. A thrumming hum resonated in 
this throat. 

The fur was both soft and rough, and warm against 
my skin. I ran my fingers through it curiously, 
learning the texture, stroking his neck where the 
color deepened. I hadn’t realized how close I’d gotten; 
without warning, Jacob suddenly licked my face from 
chin to hairline. 

“Ew! Gross, Jake!” I complained, jumping back and 
smacking at him, just as I would have if he were 
human. He dodged out of the way, and the coughing 
bark that came through his teeth was obviously 
laughter. 

I wiped my face on the sleeve of my shirt, unable to 
keep from laughing with him. 

It was at that point that I realized that everyone was 
watching us, the Cullens and the werewolves — the 
Cullens with perplexed and somewhat disgusted 
expressions. It was hard to read the wolves’ faces. I 
thought Sam looked unhappy. 

And then there was Edward, on edge and clearly 
disappointed. I realized he’d been hoping for a 
different reaction from me. Like screaming and 
running away in terror. 

Jacob made the laughing sound again. 

The other wolves were backing away now, not taking 
their eyes off the Cullens as they departed. Jacob 
stood by my side, watching them go. Soon, they 

428 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




disappeared into the murky forest. Only two hesitated 
by the trees, watching Jacob, their postures radiating 
anxiety. 

Edward sighed, and — ignoring Jacob — came to 
stand on my other side, taking my hand. 

“Ready to go?” he asked me. 

Before I could answer, he was staring over me at 
Jacob. 

“I’ve not quite figured out all the details yet,” he said, 
answering a question in Jacob’s thoughts. 

The Jacob-wolf grumbled sullenly. 

“It’s more complicated than that,” Edward said. “Don’t 
concern yourself; I’ll make sure it’s safe.” 

“What are you talking about?” I demanded. 

“Just discussing strategy,” Edward said. 

Jacob’s head swiveled back and forth, looking at our 
faces. Then, suddenly, he bolted for the forest. As he 
darted away, I noticed for the first time a square of 
folded black fabric secured to his back leg. 

“Wait,” I called, one hand stretching out automatically 
to reach after him. But he disappeared into the trees 
in seconds, the other two wolves following. 

“Why did he leave?” I asked, hurt. 

“He’s coming back,” Edward said. He sighed. “He 
wants to be able to talk for himself.” 



429 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I watched the edge of the forest where Jacob had 
vanished, leaning into Edward’s side again. I was on 
the point of collapse, but I was fighting it. 

Jacob loped back into view, on two legs this time. His 
broad chest was bare, his hair tangled and shaggy. 

He wore only a pair of black sweat pants, his feet bare 
to the cold ground. He was alone now, but I 
suspected that his friends lingered in the trees, 
invisible. 

It didn’t take him long to cross the field, though he 
gave a wide berth to the Cullens, who stood talking 
quietly in a loose circle. 

“Okay, bloodsucker,” Jacob said when he was a few 
feet from us, evidently continuing the conversation I’d 
missed. “What’s so complicated about it?” 

“I have to consider every possibility,” Edward said, 
unruffled. “What if someone gets by you?” 

Jacob snorted at that idea. “Okay, so leave her on the 
reservation. We’re making Collin and Brady stay 
behind anyway. She’ll be safe there.” 

I scowled. “Are you talking about me?” 

“I just want to know what he plans to do with you 
during the fight,” Jacob explained. 

“Do with me?” 

“You can’t stay in Forks, Bella.” Edward’s voice was 
pacifying. “They know where to look for you there. 
What if someone slipped by us?” 

My stomach dropped and the blood drained from my 
face. “Charlie?” I gasped. 

430 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“He’ll be with Billy,” Jacob assured me quickly. “If my 
dad has to commit a murder to get him there, he’ll do 
it. Probably it won’t take that much. It’s this 
Saturday, right? There’s a game.” 

“This Saturday?” I asked, my head spinning. I was too 
lightheaded to control my wildly random thoughts. I 
frowned at Edward. “Well, crap! There goes your 
graduation present.” 

Edward laughed. “It’s the thought that counts,” he 
reminded me. “You can give the tickets to someone 
else.” 

Inspiration came swiftly. “Angela and Ben,” I decided 
at once. “At least that will get them out of town.” 

He touched my cheek. “You can’t evacuate everyone,” 
he said in a gentle voice. “Hiding you is just a 
precaution. I told you — we’ll have no problem now. 
There won’t be enough of them to keep us 
entertained.” 

“But what about keeping her in La Push?” Jacob 
interjected, impatient. 

“She’s been back and forth too much,” Edward said. 
“She’s left trails all over the place. Alice only sees very 
young vampires coming on the hunt, but obviously 
someone created them. There is someone more 
experienced behind this. Whoever he” — Edward 
paused to look at me — “or she is, this could all be a 
distraction. Alice will see if he decides to look himself, 
but we could be very busy at the time that decision is 
made. Maybe someone is counting on that. I can’t 
leave her somewhere she’s been frequently. She has 
to be hard to find, just in case. It’s a very long shot, 
but I’m not taking chances.” 



431 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I stared at Edward as he explained, my forehead 
creasing. He patted my arm. 

“Just being overcautious,” he promised. 

Jacob gestured to the deep forest east of us, to the 
vast expanse of the Olympic Mountains. 

“So hide her here,” he suggested. “There’s a million 
possibilities — places either one of us could be in just 
a few minutes if there’s a need.” 

Edward shook his head. “Her scent is too strong and, 
combined with mine, especially distinct. Even if I 
carried her, it would leave a trail. Our trace is all over 
the range, but in conjunction with Bella’s scent, it 
would catch their attention. We’re not sure exactly 
which path they’ll take, because they don’t know yet. 
If they crossed her scent before they found us ...” 

Both of them grimaced at the same time, their 
eyebrows pulling together. 

“You see the difficulties.” 

“There has to be a way to make it work,” Jacob 
muttered. He glared toward the forest, pursing his 
lips. 

I swayed on my feet. Edward put his arm around my 
waist, pulling me closer and supporting my weight. 

“I need to get you home — you’re exhausted. And 
Charlie will be waking up soon... .” 

“Wait a sec,” Jacob said, wheeling back to us, his eyes 
bright. “My scent disgusts you, right?”

“Hmm, not bad.” Edward was two steps ahead. “It’s 
possible.” He turned toward his family. “Jasper?” he 
called. 

Jasper looked up curiously. He walked over with Alice 
a half step behind. Her face was frustrated again. 

“Okay, Jacob.” Edward nodded at him. 

Jacob turned toward me with a strange mixture of 
emotion on his face. He was clearly excited by 
whatever this new plan of his was, but he was also 
still uneasy so close to his enemy allies. And then it 
was my turn to be wary as he held his arms out 
toward me. 

Edward took a deep breath. 

“We’re going to see if I can confuse the scent enough 
to hide your trail,” Jacob explained. 

I stared at his open arms suspiciously. 

“You’re going to have to let him carry you, Bella,” 
Edward told me. His voice was calm, but I could hear 
the subdued distaste. 

I frowned. 

Jacob rolled his eyes, impatient, and reached down to 
yank me up into his arms. 

“Don’t be such a baby,” he muttered. 

But his eyes flickered to Edward, just like mine did. 
Edward’s face was composed and smooth. He spoke 
to Jasper. 



433 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Bella’s scent is so much more potent to me — I 
thought it would be a fairer test if someone else tried.” 

Jacob turned away from them and paced swiftly into 
the woods. I didn’t say anything as the dark closed 
around us. I was pouting, uncomfortable in Jacob’s 
arms. It felt too intimate to me — surely he didn’t 
need to hold me quite so tightly — and I couldn’t help 
but wonder what it felt like to him. It reminded me of 
my last afternoon in La Push, and I didn’t want to 
think about that. I folded my arms, annoyed when the 
brace on my hand intensified the memory. 

We didn’t go far; he made a wide arc and came back 
into the clearing from a different direction, maybe half 
a football field away from our original departure point. 
Edward was there alone and Jacob headed toward 
him. 

“You can put me down now.” 

“I don’t want to take a chance of messing up the 
experiment.” His walk slowed and his arms tightened. 

“You are so annoying,” I muttered. 

“Thanks.” 

Out of nowhere, Jasper and Alice stood beside 
Edward. Jacob took one more step, and then set me 
down a half dozen feet from Edward. Without looking 
back at Jacob, I walked to Edward’s side and took his 
hand. 

“Well?” I asked. 

“As long as you don’t touch anything, Bella, I can’t 
imagine someone sticking their nose close enough to 



434 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




that trail to catch your scent,” Jasper said, grimacing. 
“It was almost completely obscured.” 

“A definite success,” Alice agreed, wrinkling her nose. 

“And it gave me an idea.” 

“Which will work,” Alice added confidently. 

“Clever,” Edward agreed. 

“How do you stand that?” Jacob muttered to me. 

Edward ignored Jacob and looked at me while he 
explained. “We’re — well, you’re — going to leave a 
false trail to the clearing, Bella. The newborns are 
hunting, your scent will excite them, and they’ll come 
exactly the way we want them to without being 
careful about it. Alice can already see that this will 
work. When they catch our scent, they’ll split up and 
try to come at us from two sides. Half will go through 
the forest, where her vision suddenly disappears... .” 

“Yes!” Jacob hissed. 

Edward smiled at him, a smile of true comradeship. 

I felt sick. How could they be so eager for this? How 
could I stand having both of them in danger? I 
couldn’t. 

I wouldn’t. 

“Not a chance,” Edward said suddenly, his voice 
disgusted. It made me jump, worrying that he’d 
somehow heard my resolve, but his eyes were on 
Jasper. 



435 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I know, I know,” Jasper said quickly. “I didn’t even 
consider it, not really.” 

Alice stepped on his foot. 

“If Bella was actually there in the clearing,” Jasper 
explained to her, “it would drive them insane. They 
wouldn’t be able to concentrate on anything but her. 

It would make picking them off truly easy... .” 

Edward’s glare had Jasper backtracking. 

“Of course it’s too dangerous for her. It was just an 
errant thought,” he said quickly. But he looked at me 
from the corner of his eyes, and the look was wistful. 

“No,” Edward said. His voice rang with finality. 

“You’re right,” Jasper said. He took Alice’s hand and 
started back to the others. “Best two out of three?” I 
heard him ask her as they went to practice again. 

Jacob stared after him in disgust. 

“Jasper looks at things from a military perspective,” 
Edward quietly defended his brother. “He looks at all 
the options — it’s thoroughness, not callousness.” 

Jacob snorted. 

He’d edged closer unconsciously, drawn by his 
absorption in the planning. He stood only three feet 
from Edward now, and, standing there between them, 

I could feel the physical tension in the air. It was like 
static, an uncomfortable charge. 

Edward got back to business. “I’ll bring her here 
Friday afternoon to lay the false trail. You can meet 
us afterward, and carry her to a place I know. 

436 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Completely out of the way, and easily defensible, not 
that it will come to that. I’ll take another route there.” 



“And then what? Leave her with a cell phone?” Jacob 
asked critically. 

“You have a better idea?” 

Jacob was suddenly smug. “Actually, I do.” 

“Oh... . Again, dog, not bad at all.” 

Jacob turned to me quickly, as if determined to play 
the good guy by keeping me in the conversation. “We 
tried to talk Seth into staying behind with the 
younger two. He’s still too young, but he’s stubborn 
and he’s resisting. So I thought of a new assignment 
for him — cell phone.” 

I tried to look like I got it. No one was fooled. 

“As long as Seth Clearwater is in his wolf form, he’ll 
be connected to the pack,” Edward said. “Distance 
isn’t a problem?” he added, turning to Jacob. 

“Nope.” 

“Three hundred miles?” Edward asked. “That’s 
impressive.” 

Jacob was the good guy again. “That’s the farthest 
we’ve ever gone to experiment,” he told me. “Still clear 
as a bell.” 

I nodded absently; I was reeling from the idea that 
little Seth Clearwater was already a werewolf, too, and 
that made it difficult to concentrate. I could see his 
bright smile, so much like a younger Jacob, in my 
head; he couldn’t be more than fifteen, if he was that. 
437 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




His enthusiasm at the council meeting bonfire 
suddenly took on new meaning. . . . 

“It’s a good idea.” Edward seemed reluctant to admit 
this. “I’ll feel better with Seth there, even without the 
instantaneous communication. I don’t know if I’d be 
able to leave Bella there alone. To think it’s come to 
this, though! Trusting werewolves!” 

“Fighting with vampires instead of against them!” 
Jacob mirrored Edward’s tone of disgust. 

“Well, you still get to fight against some of them,” 
Edward said. 

Jacob smiled. “That’s the reason we’re here.” 



438 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




SELFISH 



Edward carried me in his arms, expecting that I 
wouldn’t be able to hang on. I must have fallen asleep 
on the way. 

When I woke up, I was in my bed and the dull light 
coming through my windows slanted in from a 
strange angle. Almost like it was afternoon. 

I yawned and stretched, my fingers searching for him 
and coming up empty. 

“Edward?” I mumbled. 

My seeking fingers encountered something cool and 
smooth. His hand. 

“Are you really awake this time?” he murmured. 

“Mmm,” I sighed in assent. “Have there been a lot of 
false alarms?” 

“You’ve been very restless — talking all day.” 

“All day?” I blinked and looked at the windows again. 

“You had a long night,” he said reassuringly. “You’d 
earned a day in bed.” 

I sat up, and my head spun. The light was coming in 
my window from the west. “Wow.” 

“Hungry?” he guessed. “Do you want breakfast in 
bed?” 



439 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



“I’ll get it,” I groaned, stretching again. “I need to get 
up and move around.” 



He held my hand on the way to the kitchen, eyeing 
me carefully, like I might fall over. Or maybe he 
thought I was sleepwalking. 

I kept it simple, throwing a couple of Pop-Tarts in the 
toaster. I caught a glimpse of myself in the reflective 
chrome. 

“Ugh, I’m a mess.” 

“It was a long night,” he said again. “You should have 
stayed here and slept.” 

“Right! And missed everything. You know, you need to 
start accepting the fact that I’m part of the family 
now.” 

He smiled. “I could probably get used to that idea.” 

I sat down with my breakfast, and he sat next to me. 
When I lifted the Pop-Tart to take the first bite, I 
noticed him staring at my hand. I looked down, and 
saw that I was still wearing the gift that Jacob had 
given me at the party. 

“May I?” he asked, reaching for the tiny wooden wolf. 

I swallowed noisily. “Um, sure.” 

He moved his hand under the charm bracelet and 
balanced the little figurine in his snowy palm. For a 
fleeting moment, I was afraid. Just the slightest twist 
of his fingers could crush it into splinters. 

But of course Edward wouldn’t do that. I was 
embarrassed I’d even had the thought. He only 

440 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




weighed the wolf in his palm for a moment, and then 
let it fall. It swung lightly from my wrist. 

I tried to read the expression in his eyes. All I could 
see was thoughtfulness; he kept everything else 
hidden, if there was anything else. 

“Jacob Black can give you presents.” 

It wasn’t a question, or an accusation. Just a 
statement of fact. But I knew he was referring to my 
last birthday and the fit I’d thrown over gifts; I hadn’t 
wanted any. Especially not from Edward. It wasn’t 
entirely logical, and, of course, everyone had ignored 
me anyway... . 

“You’ve given me presents,” I reminded him. “You 
know I like the homemade kind.” 

He pursed his lips for a second. “How about hand- 
me-downs? Are those acceptable?” 

“What do you mean?” 

“This bracelet.” His finger traced a circle around my 
wrist. “You’ll be wearing this a lot?” 

I shrugged. 

“Because you wouldn’t want to hurt his feelings,” he 
suggested shrewdly. 

“Sure, I guess so.” 

“Don’t you think it’s fair, then,” he asked, looking 
down at my hand as he spoke. He turned it palm up, 
and ran his finger along the veins in my wrist. “If I 
have a little representation?” 



441 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Representation?” 

“A charm — something to keep me on your mind.” 

“You’re in every thought I have. I don’t need 
reminders.” 

“If I gave you something, would you wear it?” he 
pressed. 

“A hand-me-down?” I checked. 

“Yes, something I’ve had for a while.” He smiled his 
angel’s smile. 

If this was the only reaction to Jacob’s gift, I would 
take it gladly. “Whatever makes you happy.” 

“Have you noticed the inequality?” he asked, and his 
voice turned accusing. “Because I certainly have.” 

“What inequality?” 

His eyes narrowed. “Everyone else is able to get away 
with giving you things. Everyone but me. I would have 
loved to get you a graduation present, but I didn’t. I 
knew it would have upset you more than if anyone 
else did. That’s utterly unfair. How do you explain 
yourself?” 

“Easy.” I shrugged. “You’re more important than 
everyone else. And you’ve given me you. That’s 
already more than I deserve, and anything else you 
give me just throws us more out of balance.” 

He processed that for a moment, and then rolled his 
eyes. “The way you regard me is ludicrous.” 



442 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I chewed my breakfast calmly. I knew he wouldn’t 
listen if I told him that he had that backward. 

Edward’s phone buzzed. 

He looked at the number before he opened it. “What is 
it, Alice?” 

He listened, and I waited for his reaction, suddenly 
nervous. But whatever she said didn’t surprise him. 
He sighed a few times. 

“I sort of guessed as much,” he told her, staring into 
my eyes, a disapproving arch to his brow. “She was 
talking in her sleep.” 

I flushed. What had I said now? 

“I’ll take care of it,” he promised. 

He glared at me as he shut his phone. “Is there 
something you’d like to talk to me about?” 

I deliberated for a moment. Given Alice’s warning last 
night, I could guess why she’d called. And then 
remembering the troubled dreams I’d had as I’d slept 
through the day — dreams where I chased after 
Jasper, trying to follow him and find the clearing in 
the maze-like woods, knowing I would find Edward 
there . . . Edward, and the monsters who wanted to kill 
me, but not caring about them because I’d already 
made my decision — I could also guess what Edward 
had overheard while I’d slept. 

I pursed my lips for a moment, not quite able to meet 
his gaze. He waited. 

“I like Jasper’s idea,” I finally said. 



443 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He groaned. 

“I want to help. I have to do something,” I insisted. 

“It wouldn’t help to have you in danger.” 

“Jasper thinks it would. This is his area of expertise.” 
Edward glowered at me. 

“You can’t keep me away,” I threatened. “I’m not going 
to hide out in the forest while you all take risks for 
me.” 

Suddenly, he was fighting a smile. “Alice doesn’t see 
you in the clearing, Bella. She sees you stumbling 
around lost in the woods. You won’t be able to find 
us; you’ll just make it more time consuming for me to 
find you afterward.” 

I tried to keep as cool as he was. “That’s because Alice 
didn’t factor in Seth Clearwater,” I said politely. “If 
she had, of course, she wouldn’t have been able to see 
anything at all. But it sounds like Seth wants to be 
there as much as I do. It shouldn’t be too hard to 
persuade him to show me the way.” 

Anger flickered across his face, and then he took a 
deep breath and composed himself. “That might have 
worked ... if you hadn’t told me. Now I’ll just ask Sam 
to give Seth certain orders. Much as he might want 
to, Seth won’t be able to ignore that kind of 
injunction.” 

I kept my smile pleasant. “But why would Sam give 
those orders? If I tell him how it would help for me to 
be there? I’ll bet Sam would rather do me a favor than 
you.” 



444 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He had to compose himself again. “Maybe you’re 
right. But I’m sure Jacob would be only too eager to 
give those same orders.” 

I frowned. “Jacob?” 

“Jacob is second in command. Did he never tell you 
that? His orders have to be followed, too.” 

He had me, and by his smile, he knew it. My forehead 
crumpled. Jacob would be on his side — in this one 
instance — I was sure. And Jacob never had told me 
that. 

Edward took advantage of the fact that I was 
momentarily stumped, continuing in a suspiciously 
smooth and soothing voice. 

“I got a fascinating look into the pack’s mind last 
night. It was better than a soap opera. I had no idea 
how complex the dynamic is with such a large pack. 
The pull of the individual against the plural psyche . . . 
Absolutely fascinating.” 

He was obviously trying to distract me. I glared at 
him. 

“Jacob’s been keeping a lot of secrets,” he said with a 
grin. 

I didn’t answer, I just kept glaring, holding on to my 
argument and waiting for an opening. 

“For instance, did you note the smaller gray wolf there 
last night?” 

I nodded one stiff nod. 



445 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He chuckled. “They take all of their legends so 
seriously. It turns out there are things that none of 
their stories prepared them for.” 

I sighed. “Okay, I’ll bite. What are you talking about?” 

“They always accepted without question that it was 
only the direct grandsons of the original wolf who had 
the power to transform.” 

“So someone changed who wasn’t a direct 
descendant?” 

“No. She’s a direct descendant, all right.” 

I blinked, and my eyes widened. “She?” 

He nodded. “She knows you. Her name is Leah 
Clearwater.” 

“Leah’s a werewolf!” I shrieked. “What? For how long? 
Why didn’t Jacob tell me?” 

“There are things he wasn’t allowed to share — their 
numbers, for instance. Like I said before, when Sam 
gives an order, the pack simply isn’t able to ignore it. 
Jacob was very careful to think of other things when 
he was near me. Of course, after last night that’s all 
out the window.” 

“I can’t believe it. Leah Clearwater!” Suddenly, I 
remembered Jacob speaking of Leah and Sam, and 
the way he acted as if he’d said too much — after he’d 
said something about Sam having to look in Leah’s 
eyes every day and know that he’d broken all his 
promises... . Leah on the cliff, a tear glistening on her 
cheek when Old Quil had spoken of the burden and 
sacrifice the Quileute sons shared... . And Billy, 
spending time with Sue because she was having 
446 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




trouble with her kids . . . and here the trouble actually 
was that both of them were werewolves now! 

I hadn’t given much thought to Leah Clearwater, just 
to grieve for her loss when Harry had passed away, 
and then to pity her again when Jacob had told her 
story, about how the strange imprinting between Sam 
and her cousin Emily had broken Leah’s heart. 

And now she was part of Sam’s pack, hearing his 
thoughts ... and unable to hide her own. 

I really hate that part, Jacob had said. Everything 
you’re ashamed of, laid out for everyone to see. 

“Poor Leah,” I whispered. 

Edward snorted. “She’s making life exceedingly 
unpleasant for the rest of them. I’m not sure she 
deserves your sympathy.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“It’s hard enough for them, having to share all their 
thoughts. Most of them try to cooperate, make it 
easier. When even one member is deliberately 
malicious, it’s painful for everyone.” 

“She has reason enough,” I mumbled, still on her 
side. 

“Oh, I know,” he said. “The imprinting compulsion is 
one of the strangest things I’ve ever witnessed in my 
life, and I’ve seen some strange things.” He shook his 
head wonderingly. “The way Sam is tied to his Emily 
is impossible to describe — or I should say her Sam. 
Sam really had no choice. It reminds me of A 
Midsummer Night’s Dream with all the chaos caused 



447 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




by the fairies’ love spells ... like magic.” He smiled. 

“It’s very nearly as strong as the way I feel about you.” 

“Poor Leah,” I said again. “But what do you mean, 
malicious?” 

“She’s constantly bringing up things they’d rather not 
think of,” he explained. “For example, Embry.” 

“What’s with Embry?” I asked, surprised. 

“His mother moved down from the Makah reservation 
seventeen years ago, when she was pregnant with 
him. She’s not Quileute. Everyone assumed she’d left 
his father behind with the Makahs. But then he 
joined the pack.” 

“So?” 

“So the prime candidates for his father are Quil 
Ateara Sr., Joshua Uley, or Billy Black, all of them 
married at that point, of course.” 

“No!” I gasped. Edward was right — this was exactly 
like a soap opera. 

“Now Sam, Jacob, and Quil all wonder which of them 
has a half-brother. They’d all like to think it’s Sam, 
since his father was never much of a father. But the 
doubt is always there. Jacob’s never been able to ask 
Billy about that.” 

“Wow. How did you get so much in one night?” 

“The pack mind is mesmerizing. All thinking together 
and then separately at the same time. There’s so 
much to read!” 



448 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He sounded faintly regretful, like someone who’d had 
to put down a good book just before the climax. I 
laughed. 

“The pack is fascinating,” I agreed. “Almost as 
fascinating as you are when you’re trying to distract 
me.” 

His expression became polite again — a perfect poker 
face. 

“I have to be in that clearing, Edward.” 

“No,” he said in a very final tone. 

A certain path occurred to me at that moment. 

It wasn’t so much that I had to be in the clearing. I 
just had to be where Edward was. 

Cruel, I accused myself. Selfish, selfish, selfish! Don’t 
do it! 

I ignored my better instincts. I couldn’t look at him 
while I spoke, though. The guilt had my eyes glued to 
the table. 

“Okay, look, Edward,” I whispered. “Here’s the thing 
... I’ve already gone crazy once. I know what my limits 
are. And I can’t stand it if you leave me again.” 

I didn’t look up to see his reaction, afraid to know 
how much pain I was inflicting. I did hear his sudden 
intake of breath and the silence that followed. I stared 
at the dark wooden tabletop, wishing I could take the 
words back. But knowing I probably wouldn’t. Not if it 
worked. 



449 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Suddenly, his arms were around me, his hands 
stroking my face, my arms. He was comforting me. 
The guilt went into spiral mode. But the survival 
instinct was stronger. There was no question that he 
was fundamental to my survival. 

“You know it’s not like that, Bella,” he murmured. “I 
won’t be far, and it will be over quickly.” 

“I can’t stand it,” I insisted, still staring down. “Not 
knowing whether or not you’ll come back. How do I 
live through that, no matter how quickly it’s over?” 

He sighed. “It’s going to be easy, Bella. There’s no 
reason for your fears.” 

“None at all?” 

“None.” 

“And everybody will be fine?” 

“Everyone,” he promised. 

“So there’s no way at all that I need to be in the 
clearing?” 

“Of course not. Alice just told me that they’re down to 
nineteen. Well be able to handle it easily.” 

“That’s right — you said it was so easy that someone 
could sit out,” I repeated his words from last night. 
“Did you really mean that?” 

“Yes.” 

It felt too simple — he had to see it coming. 

“So easy that you could sit out?” 

450 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




After a long moment of silence, I finally looked up at 
his expression. 

The poker face was back. 



I took a deep breath. “So it’s one way or the other. 
Either there is more danger than you want me to 
know about, in which case it would be right for me to 
be there, to do what I can to help. Or ... it’s going to 
be so easy that they’ll get by without you. Which way 



is it?” 



He didn’t speak. 

I knew what he was thinking of — the same thing I 
was thinking of. Carlisle. Esme. Emmett. Rosalie. 
Jasper. And ... I forced myself to think the last name. 
And Alice. 

I wondered if I was a monster. Not the kind that he 
thought he was, but the real kind. The kind that hurt 
people. The kind that had no limits when it came to 
what they wanted. 

What I wanted was to keep him safe, safe with me. 

Did I have a limit to what I would do, what I would 
sacrifice for that? I wasn’t sure. 

“You ask me to let them fight without my help?” he 
said in a quiet voice. 

“Yes.” I was surprised I could keep my voice even, I 
felt so wretched inside. “Or to let me be there. Either 
way, so long as we’re together.” 

He took a deep breath, and then exhaled slowly. He 
moved his hands to place them on either side of my 
face, forcing me to meet his gaze. He looked into my 
eyes for a long time. I wondered what he was looking 

451 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




for, and what it was that he found. Was the guilt as 
thick on my face as it was in my stomach — sickening 
me? 

His eyes tightened against some emotion I couldn’t 
read, and he dropped one hand to pull out his phone 
again. 

“Alice,” he sighed. “Could you come babysit Bella for a 
bit?” He raised one eyebrow, daring me to object to 
the word. “I need to speak with Jasper.” 

She evidently agreed. He put the phone away and 
went back to staring at my face. 

“What are you going to say to Jasper?” I whispered. 

“I’m going to discuss ... me sitting out.” 

It was easy to read in his face how difficult the words 
were for him. 

“I’m sorry.” 

I was sorry. I hated to make him do this. Not enough 
that I could fake a smile and tell him to go on ahead 
without me. Definitely not that much. 

“Don’t apologize,” he said, smiling just a little. “Never 
be afraid to tell me how you feel, Bella. If this is what 
you need ...” He shrugged. “You are my first priority.” 

“I didn’t mean it that way — like you have to choose 
me over your family.” 

“I know that. Besides, that’s not what you asked. You 
gave me two alternatives that you could live with, and 
I chose the one that I could live with. That’s how 
compromise is supposed to work.” 

452 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I leaned forward and rested my forehead against his 
chest. “Thank you,” I whispered. 

“Anytime,” he answered, kissing my hair. “Anything.” 

We didn’t move for a long moment. I kept my face 
hidden, pressed against his shirt. Two voices 
struggled inside me. One that wanted to be good and 
brave, and one that told the good one to keep her 
mouth shut. 

“Who’s the third wife?” he asked me suddenly. 

“Huh?” I said, stalling. I didn’t remember having had 
that dream again. 

“You were mumbling something about ‘the third wife’ 
last night. The rest made a little sense, but you lost 
me there.” 

“Oh. Um, yeah. That was just one of the stories that I 
heard at the bonfire the other night.” I shrugged. “I 
guess it stuck with me.” 

Edward leaned away from me and cocked his head to 
the side, probably confused by the uncomfortable 
edge to my voice. 

Before he could ask, Alice appeared in the kitchen 
doorway with a sour expression. 

“You’re going to miss all the fun,” she grumbled. 

“Hello, Alice,” he greeted her. He put one finger under 
my chin and tilted my face up to kiss me goodbye. 

“I’ll be back later tonight,” he promised me. “I’ll go 
work this out with the others, rearrange things.” 



453 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Okay.” 



“There’s not much to arrange,” Alice said. “I already 
told them. Emmett is pleased.” 

Edward sighed. “Of course he is.” 

He walked out the door, leaving me to face Alice. 

She glared at me. 

“I’m sorry,” I apologized again. “Do you think this will 
make it more dangerous for you?” 

She snorted. “You worry too much, Bella. You’re going 
to go prematurely gray.” 

“Why are you upset, then?” 

“Edward is such a grouch when he doesn’t get his 
way. I’m just anticipating living with him for the next 
few months.” She made a face. “I suppose, if it keeps 
you sane, it’s worth it. But I wish you could control 
the pessimism, Bella. It’s so unnecessary.” 

“Would you let Jasper go without you?” I demanded. 

Alice grimaced. “That’s different.” 

“Sure it is.” 

“Go clean yourself up,” she ordered me. “Charlie will 
be home in fifteen minutes, and if you look this 
ragged he’s not going to want to let you out again.” 

Wow, I’d really lost the whole day. It felt like such a 
waste. I was glad I wouldn’t always have to squander 
my time with sleeping.

I was entirely presentable when Charlie got home — 
fully dressed, hair decent, and in the kitchen putting 
his dinner on the table. Alice sat in Edward’s usual 
place, and this seemed to make Charlie’s day. 

“Howdy, Alice! How are you, hon?” 

“I’m fine, Charlie, thanks.” 

“I see you finally made it out of bed, sleepyhead,” he 
said to me as I sat beside him, before turning back to 
Alice. “Everyone’s talking about that party your 
parents threw last night. I’ll bet you’ve got one heck of 
a clean-up job ahead of you.” 

Alice shrugged. Knowing her, it was already done. 

“It was worth it,” she said. “It was a great party.” 

“Where’s Edward?” Charlie asked, a little grudgingly. 
“Is he helping clean up?” 

Alice sighed and her face turned tragic. It was 
probably an act, but it was too perfect for me to be 
positive. “No. He’s off planning the weekend with 
Emmett and Carlisle.” 

“Hiking again?” 

Alice nodded, her face suddenly forlorn. “Yes. They’re 
all going, except me. We always go backpacking at the 
end of the school year, sort of a celebration, but this 
year I decided I’d rather shop than hike, and not one 
of them will stay behind with me. I’m abandoned.” 

Her face puckered, the expression so devastated that 
Charlie leaned toward her automatically, one hand 
reaching out, looking for some way to help. I glared at 
her suspiciously. What was she doing? 

455 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Alice, honey, why don’t you come stay with us,” 
Charlie offered. “I hate to think of you all alone in that 
big house.” 

She sighed. Something squashed my foot under the 
table. 

“Ow!” I protested. 

Charlie turned to me. “What?” 

Alice shot me a frustrated look. I could tell she 
thought that I was very slow tonight. 

“Stubbed my toe,” I muttered. 

“Oh.” He looked back at Alice. “So, how ’bout it?” 

She stepped on my foot again, not quite so hard this 
time. 

“Er, Dad, you know, we don’t really have the best 
accommodations here. I bet Alice doesn’t want to 
sleep on my floor... .” 

Charlie pursed his lips. Alice pulled out the 
devastated expression again. 

“Maybe Bella should stay up there with you,” he 
suggested. “Just until your folks get back.” 

“Oh, would you, Bella?” Alice smiled at me radiantly. 
“You don’t mind shopping with me, right?” 

“Sure,” I agreed. “Shopping. Okay.” 

“When are they leaving?” Charlie asked. 

Alice made another face. “Tomorrow.” 

456 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“When do you want me?” I asked. 

“After dinner, I guess,” she said, and then put one 
finger to her chin, thoughtful. “You don’t have 
anything going on Saturday, do you? I want to get out 
of town to shop, and it will be an all-day thing.” 

“Not Seattle,” Charlie interjected, his eyebrows pulling 
together. 

“Of course not,” Alice agreed at once, though we both 
knew Seattle would be plenty safe on Saturday. “I was 
thinking Olympia, maybe... .” 

“You’ll like that, Bella.” Charlie was cheerful with 
relief. “Go get your fill of the city.” 

“Yeah, Dad. It’ll be great.” 

With one easy conversation, Alice had cleared my 
schedule for the battle. 

Edward returned not much later. He accepted 
Charlie’s wishes for a nice trip without surprise. He 
claimed they were leaving early in the morning, and 
said goodnight before the usual time. Alice left with 
him. 

I excused myself soon after they left. 

“You can’t be tired,” Charlie protested. 

“A little,” I lied. 

“No wonder you like to skip the parties,” he muttered. 
“It takes you so long to recover.” 

Upstairs, Edward was lying across my bed. 



457 | P a g e

“What time are we meeting with the wolves?” I 
murmured as I went to join him. 

“In an hour.” 

“That’s good. Jake and his friends need to get some 
sleep.” 

“They don’t need as much as you do,” he pointed out. 

I moved to another topic, assuming he was about to 
try to talk me into staying home. “Did Alice tell you 
that she’s kidnapping me again?” 

He grinned. “Actually, she’s not.” 

I stared at him, confused, and he laughed quietly at 
my expression. 

“I’m the only one who has permission to hold you 
hostage, remember?” he said. “Alice is going hunting 
with the rest of them.” He sighed. “I guess I don’t 
need to do that now.” 

“You’re kidnapping me?” 

He nodded. 

I thought about that briefly. No Charlie listening 
downstairs, checking on me every so often. And no 
houseful of wide-awake vampires with their 
intrusively sensitive hearing. . . . Just him and me — 
really alone. 

“Is that all right?” he asked, concerned by my silence. 
“Well ... sure, except for one thing.” 



458 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“What thing?” His eyes were anxious. It was mind- 
boggling, but, somehow, he still seemed unsure of his 
hold on me. Maybe I needed to make myself more 
clear. 

“Why didn’t Alice tell Charlie you were leaving 
tonight?” I asked. 

He laughed, relieved. 

I enjoyed the trip to the clearing more than I had last 
night. I still felt guilty, still afraid, but I wasn’t 
terrified anymore. I could function. I could see past 
what was coming, and almost believe that maybe it 
would be okay. Edward was apparently fine with the 
idea of missing the fight ... and that made it very hard 
not to believe him when he said this would be easy. 

He wouldn’t leave his family if he didn’t believe it 
himself. Maybe Alice was right, and I did worry too 
much. 

We got to the clearing last. 

Jasper and Emmett were already wrestling — just 
warming up from the sounds of their laughter. Alice 
and Rosalie lounged on the hard ground, watching. 
Esme and Carlisle were talking a few yards away, 
heads close together, fingers linked, not paying 
attention. 

It was much brighter tonight, the moon shining 
through the thin clouds, and I could easily see the 
three wolves that sat around the edge of the practice 
ring, spaced far apart to watch from different angles. 

It was also easy to recognize Jacob; I would have 
known him at once, even if he hadn’t looked up and 
stared at the sound of our approach. 



459 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Where are the rest of the wolves?” I wondered. 

“They don’t all need to be here. One would do the job, 
but Sam didn’t trust us enough to just send Jacob, 
though Jacob was willing. Quil and Embry are his 
usual ... I guess you could call them his wingmen.” 

“Jacob trusts you.” 

Edward nodded. “He trusts us not to try to kill him. 
That’s about it, though.” 

“Are you participating tonight?” I asked, hesitant. I 
knew this was going to be almost as hard for him as 
being left behind would have been for me. Maybe 
harder. 

“I’ll help Jasper when he needs it. He wants to try 
some unequal groupings, teach them how to deal with 
multiple attackers.” 

He shrugged. 

And a fresh wave of panic shattered my brief sense of 
confidence. 

They were still outnumbered. I was making that 
worse. 

I stared at the field, trying to hide my reaction. 

It was the wrong place to look, struggling as I was to 
lie to myself, to convince myself that everything would 
work out as I needed it to. Because when I forced my 
eyes away from the Cullens — away from the image of 
their play fighting that would be real and deadly in 
just a few days — Jacob caught my eyes and smiled. 



460 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




It was the same wolfy grin as before, his eyes 
scrunching the way they did when he was human. 



It was hard to believe that, not so long ago, I’d found 
the werewolves frightening — lost sleep to nightmares 
about them. 

I knew, without asking, which of the others was 
Embry and which was Quil. Because Embry was 
clearly the thinner gray wolf with the dark spots on 
his back, who sat so patiently watching, while Quil — 
deep chocolate brown, lighter over his face — 
twitched constantly, looking like he was dying to join 
in the mock fight. They weren’t monsters, even like 
this. They were friends. 

Friends who didn’t look nearly as indestructible as 
Emmett and Jasper did, moving faster than cobra 
strikes while the moonlight glinted off their granite- 
hard skin. Friends who didn’t seem to understand the 
danger involved here. Friends who were still 
somewhat mortal, friends who could bleed, friends 
who could die... . 

Edward’s confidence was reassuring, because it was 
plain that he wasn’t truly worried about his family. 
But would it hurt him if something happened to the 
wolves? Was there any reason for him to be anxious, 
if that possibility didn’t bother him? Edward’s 
confidence only applied to one set of my fears. 

I tried to smile back at Jacob, swallowing against the 
lump in my throat. I didn’t seem to get it right. 

Jacob sprang lightly to his feet, his agility at odds 
with his sheer mass, and trotted over to where 
Edward and I stood on the fringe of things. 

“Jacob,” Edward greeted him politely. 

461 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jacob ignored him, his dark eyes on me. He put his 
head down to my level, as he had yesterday, cocking 
it to one side. A low whimper escaped his muzzle. 

“I’m fine,” I answered, not needing the translation 
that Edward was about to give. “Just worried, you 
know.” 

Jacob continued to stare at me. 

“He wants to know why,” Edward murmured. 

Jacob growled — not a threatening sound, an 
annoyed sound — and Edward’s lips twitched. 

“What?” I asked. 

“He thinks my translations leave something to be 
desired. What he actually thought was, That’s really 
stupid. What is there to be worried about?’ I edited, 
because I thought it was rude.” 

I halfway smiled, too anxious to really feel amused. 
“There’s plenty to be worried about,” I told Jacob. 
“Like a bunch of really stupid wolves getting 
themselves hurt.” 

Jacob laughed his coughing bark. 

Edward sighed. “Jasper wants help. You’ll be okay 
without a translator?” 

“I’ll manage.” 

Edward looked at me wistfully for one minute, his 
expression hard to understand, then turned his back 
and strode over to where Jasper waited. 



462 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I sat down where I was. The ground was cold and 
uncomfortable . 



Jacob took a step forward, then looked back at me, 
and a low whine rose in his throat. He took another 
half-step. 

“Go on without me,” I told him. “I don’t want to 
watch.” 

Jacob leaned his head to the side again for a moment, 
and then folded himself on to the ground beside me 
with a rumbling sigh. 

“Really, you can go ahead,” I assured him. He didn’t 
respond, he just put his head down on his paws. 

I stared up at the bright silver clouds, not wanting to 
see the fight. My imagination had more than enough 
fuel. A breeze blew through the clearing, and I 
shivered. 

Jacob scooted himself closer to me, pressing his 
warm fur against my left side. 

“Er, thanks,” I muttered. 

After a few minutes, I leaned against his wide 
shoulder. It was much more comfortable that way. 

The clouds moved slowly across the sky, dimming 
and brightening as thick patches crossed the moon 
and passed on. 

Absently, I began pulling my fingers through the fur 
on his neck. That same strange humming sound that 
he’d made yesterday rumbled in his throat. It was a 
homey kind of sound. Rougher, wilder than a cat’s 
purr, but conveying the same sense of contentment. 
463 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You know, I never had a dog,” I mused. “I always 
wanted one, but Renee’s allergic.” 

Jacob laughed; his body shook under me. 

“Aren’t you worried about Saturday at all?” I asked. 

He turned his enormous head toward me, so that I 
could see one of his eyes roll. 

“I wish I could feel that positive.” 

He leaned his head against my leg and started 
humming again. And it did make me feel just a little 
bit better. 

“So we’ve got some hiking to do tomorrow, I guess.” 

He rumbled; the sound was enthusiastic. 

“It might be a long hike,” I warned him. “Edward 
doesn’t judge distances the way a normal person 
does.” 

Jacob barked another laugh. 

I settled deeper into his warm fur, resting my head 
against his neck. 

It was strange. Even though he was in this bizarre 
form, this felt more like the way Jake and I used to be 
— the easy, effortless friendship that was as natural 
as breathing in and out — than the last few times I’d 
been with Jacob while he was human. Odd that I 
should find that again here, when I’d thought this 
wolf thing was the cause of its loss. 

The killing games continued in the clearing, and I 
stared at the hazy moon.

COMPROMISE 




Everything was ready. 

I was packed for my two-day visit with “Alice,” and my 
bag waited for me on the passenger seat of my truck. 
I’d given the concert tickets to Angela, Ben, and Mike. 
Mike was going to take Jessica, which was exactly as 
I’d hoped. Billy had borrowed Old Quil Ateara’s boat 
and invited Charlie down for some open sea fishing 
before the afternoon game started. Collin and Brady, 
the two youngest werewolves, were staying behind to 
protect La Push — though they were just children, 
both of them only thirteen. Still, Charlie would be 
safer than anyone left in Forks. 

I had done all that I could do. I tried to accept that, 
and put the things that were outside of my control 
out of my head, for tonight at least. One way or 
another, this would all be over in forty-eight hours. 
The thought was almost comforting. 

Edward had requested that I relax, and I was going to 
do my best. 

“For this one night, could we try to forget everything 
besides just you and me?” he’d pleaded, unleashing 
the full force of his eyes on me. “It seems like I can 
never get enough time like that. I need to be with you. 
Just you.” 

That was not a hard request to agree to, though I 
knew that forgetting my fears would be much easier 
said than done. Other matters were on my mind now, 



465 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



knowing that we had this night to be alone, and that 
would help. 

There were some things that had changed. 

For instance, I was ready. 

I was ready to join his family and his world. The fear 
and guilt and anguish I was feeling now had taught 
me that much. I’d had a chance to concentrate on 
this — as I’d gazed at the moon through the clouds 
and rested against a werewolf — and I knew I would 
not panic again. The next time something came at us, 
I would be ready. An asset, not a liability. He would 
never have to make the choice between me and his 
family again. We would be partners, like Alice and 
Jasper. Next time, I would do my part. 

I would wait for the sword to be removed from over 
my head, so that Edward would be satisfied. But it 
wasn’t necessary. I was ready. 

There was only one missing piece. 

One piece, because there were some things that had 
not changed, and that included the desperate way I 
loved him. I’d had plenty of time to think through the 
ramifications of Jasper and Emmett’s bet — to figure 
out the things I was willing to lose with my humanity, 
and the part that I was not willing to give up. I knew 
which human experience I was going to insist on 
before I became inhuman. 

So we had some things to work out tonight. After 
everything I’d seen in the past two years, I didn’t 
believe in the word impossible anymore. It was going 
to take more than that to stop me now. 



466 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Okay, well, honestly, it was probably going to be 
much more complicated than that. But I was going to 
try. 



As decided as I was, I wasn’t surprised that I still felt 
nervous as I drove down the long path to his house — 
I didn’t know how to do what I was trying to do, and 
that guaranteed me some serious jitters. He sat in the 
passenger seat, fighting a smile at my slow pace. I 
was surprised that he hadn’t insisted on taking the 
wheel, but tonight he seemed content to go at my 
speed. 

It was after dark when we reached the house. In spite 
of that, the meadow was bright in the light shining 
from every window. 

As soon as I cut the engine he was at my door, 
opening it for me. He lifted me from the cab with one 
arm, slinging my bag out of the truck bed and over 
his shoulder with the other. His lips found mine as I 
heard him kick the truck’s door shut behind me. 

Without breaking the kiss, he swung me up so that I 
was cradled in his arms and carried me into the 
house. 

Was the front door already open? I didn’t know. We 
were inside, though, and I was dizzy. I had to remind 
myself to breathe. 

This kissing did not frighten me. It wasn’t like before 
when I could feel the fear and panic leaking through 
his control. His lips were not anxious, but 
enthusiastic now — he seemed as thrilled as I was 
that we had tonight to concentrate on being together. 
He continued to kiss me for several minutes, standing 
there in the entry; he seemed less guarded than 
usual, his mouth cold and urgent on mine. 

467 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I began to feel cautiously optimistic. Perhaps getting 
what I wanted would not be as difficult as I’d expected 
it to be. 

No, of course it was going to be just exactly that 
difficult. 

With a low chuckle, he pulled me away, holding me at 
arm’s length. 

“Welcome home,” he said, his eyes liquid and warm. 

“That sounds nice,” I said, breathless. 

He set me gently on my feet. I wrapped both my arms 
around him, refusing to allow any space between us. 

“I have something for you,” he said, his tone 
conversational. 

“Oh?” 

“Your hand-me-down, remember? You said that was 
allowable.” 

“Oh, that’s right. I guess I did say that.” 

He chuckled at my reluctance. 

“It’s up in my room. Shall I go get it?” 

His bedroom? “Sure,” I agreed, feeling quite devious 
as I wound my fingers through his. “Let’s go.” 

He must have been eager to give me my non-present, 
because human velocity was not fast enough for him. 
He scooped me up again and nearly flew up the stairs 
to his room. He set me down at the door, and darted 
into his closet. 

468 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He was back before I’d taken a step, but I ignored him 
and went to the huge gold bed, plopping down on the 
edge and then sliding to the center. I curled up in a 
ball, my arms wrapped around my knees. 

“Okay,” I grumbled. Now that I was where I wanted to 
be, I could afford a little reluctance. “Let me have it.” 

Edward laughed. 

He climbed onto the bed to sit next to me, and my 
heart thumped unevenly. Hopefully he would write 
that off as some reaction to him giving me presents. 

“A hand-me-down,” he reminded me sternly. He 
pulled my left wrist away from my leg, and touched 
the silver bracelet for just a moment. Then he gave 
me my arm back. 

I examined it cautiously. On the opposite side of the 
chain from the wolf, there now hung a brilliant heart- 
shaped crystal. It was cut in a million facets, so that 
even in the subdued light shining from the lamp, it 
sparkled. I inhaled in a low gasp. 

“It was my mother’s.” He shrugged deprecatingly. “I 
inherited quite a few baubles like this. I’ve given some 
to Esme and Alice both. So, clearly, this is not a big 
deal in any way.” 

I smiled ruefully at his assurance. 

“But I thought it was a good representation,” he 
continued. “It’s hard and cold.” He laughed. “And it 
throws rainbows in the sunlight.” 

“You forgot the most important similarity,” I 
murmured. “It’s beautiful.” 



469 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“My heart is just as silent,” he mused. “And it, too, is 
yours.” 

I twisted my wrist so the heart would glimmer. 

“Thank you. For both.” 

“No, thank you. It’s a relief to have you accept a gift 
so easily. Good practice for you, too.” He grinned, 
flashing his teeth. 

I leaned into him, ducking my head under his arm 
and cuddling into his side. It probably felt similar to 
snuggling with Michelangelo’s David, except that this 
perfect marble creature wrapped his arms around me 
to pull me closer. 

It seemed like a good place to start. 

“Can we discuss something? I’d appreciate it if you 
could begin by being open-minded.” 

He hesitated for a moment. “I’ll give it my best effort,” 
he agreed, cautious now. 

“I’m not breaking any rules here,” I promised. “This is 
strictly about you and me.” I cleared my throat. “So ... 
I was impressed by how well we were able to 
compromise the other night. I was thinking I would 
like to apply the same principle to a different 
situation.” I wondered why I was being so formal. 
Must be the nerves. 

“What would you like to negotiate?” he asked, a smile 
in his voice. 

I struggled, trying to find exactly the right words to 
open with. 



470 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Listen to your heart fly,” he murmured. “It’s 
fluttering like a hummingbird’s wings. Are you all 
right?” 

“I’m great.” 

“Please go on then,” he encouraged. 

“Well, I guess, first, I wanted to talk to you about that 
whole ridiculous marriage condition thing.” 

“It’s only ridiculous to you. What about it?” 

“I was wondering ... is that open to negotiation?” 

Edward frowned, serious now. “I’ve already made the 
largest concession by far and away — I’ve agreed to 
take your life away against my better judgment. And 
that ought to entitle me to a few compromises on your 
part.” 

“No.” I shook my head, focusing on keeping my face 
composed. “That part’s a done deal. We’re not 
discussing my . . . renovations right now. I want to 
hammer out some other details.” 

He looked at me suspiciously. “Which details do you 
mean exactly?” 

I hesitated. “Let’s clarify your prerequisites first.” 

“You know what I want.” 

“Matrimony.” I made it sound like a dirty word. 

“Yes.” He smiled a wide smile. “To start with.” 

The shock spoiled my carefully composed expression. 
“There’s more?” 

471 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Well,” he said, and his face was calculating. “If you’re 
my wife, then what’s mine is yours ... like tuition 
money. So there would be no problem with 
Dartmouth.” 

“Anything else? While you’re already being absurd?” 

“I wouldn’t mind some time.” 

“No. No time. That’s a deal breaker right there.” 

He sighed longingly. “Just a year or two?” 

I shook my head, my lips set in a stubborn frown. 
“Move along to the next one.” 

“That’s it. Unless you’d like to talk cars ...” 

He grinned widely when I grimaced, then took my 
hand and began playing with my fingers. 

“I didn’t realize there was anything else you wanted 
besides being transformed into a monster yourself. 

I’m extremely curious.” His voice was low and soft. 

The slight edge would have been hard to detect if I 
hadn’t known it so well. 

I paused, staring at his hand on mine. I still didn’t 
know how to begin. I felt his eyes watching me and I 
was afraid to look up. The blood began to burn in my 
face. 

His cool fingers brushed my cheek. “You’re blushing?” 
he asked in surprise. I kept my eyes down. “Please, 
Bella, the suspense is painful.” 

I bit my lip. 



472 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Bella.” His tone reproached me now, reminded me 
that it was hard for him when I kept my thoughts to 
myself. 

“Well, I’m a little worried ... about after,” I admitted, 
finally looking at him. 

I felt his body tense, but his voice was gentle and 
velvet. “What has you worried?” 

“All of you just seem so convinced that the only thing 
I’m going to be interested in, afterward, is 
slaughtering everyone in town,” I confessed, while he 
winced at my choice of words. “And I’m afraid I’ll be 
so preoccupied with the mayhem that I won’t be me 
anymore ... and that I won’t ... I won’t want you the 
same way I do now.” 

“Bella, that part doesn’t last forever,” he assured me. 
He was missing the point. 

“Edward,” I said, nervous, staring at a freckle on my 
wrist. “There’s something that I want to do before I’m 
not human anymore.” 

He waited for me to continue. I didn’t. My face was all 
hot. 

“Whatever you want,” he encouraged, anxious and 
completely clueless. 

“Do you promise?” I muttered, knowing my attempt to 
trap him with his words was not going to work, but 
unable to resist. 

“Yes,” he said. I looked up to see that his eyes were 
earnest and confused. “Tell me what you want, and 
you can have it.” 

473 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I couldn’t believe how awkward and idiotic I felt. I was 
too innocent — which was, of course, central to the 
discussion. I didn’t have the faintest idea how to be 
seductive. I would just have to settle for flushed and 
self-conscious. 

“You,” I mumbled almost incoherently. 

“I’m yours.” He smiled, still oblivious, trying to hold 
my gaze as I looked away again. 

I took a deep breath and shifted forward so that I was 
kneeling on the bed. Then I wrapped my arms around 
his neck and kissed him. 

He kissed me back, bewildered but willing. His lips 
were gentle against mine, and I could tell his mind 
was elsewhere — trying to figure out what was on my 
mind. I decided he needed a hint. 

My hands were slightly shaky as I unlocked my arms 
from around his neck. My fingers slid down his neck 
to the collar of his shirt. The trembling didn’t help as I 
tried to hurry to undo the buttons before he stopped 
me. 

His lips froze, and I could almost hear the click in his 
head as he put together my words and my actions. 

He pushed me away at once, his face heavily 
disapproving. 

“Be reasonable, Bella.” 

“You promised — whatever I wanted,” I reminded him 
without hope. 



474 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“We’re not having this discussion.” He glared at me 
while he refastened the two buttons I’d managed to 
open. 

My teeth clamped together. 

“I say we are,” I growled. I moved my hands to my 
blouse and yanked open the top button. 

He grabbed my wrists and pinned them to my sides. 

“I say we’re not,” he said flatly. 

We glowered at each other. 

“You wanted to know,” I pointed out. 

“I thought it would be something faintly realistic.” 

“So you can ask for any stupid, ridiculous thing you 
want — like getting married — but I’m not allowed to 
even discuss what I — ” 

While I was ranting, he pulled my hands together to 
restrain them in just one of his, and put his other 
hand over my mouth. 

“No.” His face was hard. 

I took a deep breath to steady myself. And, as the 
anger began to fade, I felt something else. 

It took me a minute to recognize why I was staring 
down again, the blush returning — why my stomach 
felt uneasy, why there was too much moisture in my 
eyes, why I suddenly wanted to run from the room. 

Rejection washed through me, instinctive and strong.

I knew it was irrational. He’d been very clear on other 
occasions that my safety was the only factor. Yet I’d 
never made myself quite so vulnerable before. I 
scowled at the golden comforter that matched his 
eyes and tried to banish the reflex reaction that told 
me I was unwanted and unwantable. 

Edward sighed. The hand over my mouth moved 
under my chin, and he pulled my face up until I had 
to look at him. 

“What now?” 

“Nothing,” I mumbled. 

He scrutinized my face for long moment while I tried 
unsuccessfully to twist away from his gaze. His brow 
furrowed, and his expression became horrified. 

“Did I hurt your feelings?” he asked, shocked. 

“No,” I lied. 

So quickly that I wasn’t even sure how it happened, I 
was in his arms, my face cradled between his 
shoulder and his hand, while his thumb stroked 
reassuringly against my cheek. 

“You know why I have to say no,” he murmured. “You 
know that I want you, too.” 

“Do you?” I whispered, my voice full of doubt. 

“Of course I do, you silly, beautiful, oversensitive girl.” 
He laughed once, and then his voice was bleak. 
“Doesn’t everyone? I feel like there’s a line behind me, 
jockeying for position, waiting for me to make a big 
enough mistake... . You’re too desirable for your own 
good.”

“Who’s being silly now?” I doubted if awkward, self- 
conscious, and inept added up to desirable in 
anyone’s book. 

“Do I have to send a petition around to get you to 
believe? Shall I tell you whose names would be on the 
top of the list? You know a few of them, but some 
might surprise you.” 

I shook my head against his chest, grimacing. “You’re 
just trying to distract me. Let’s get back to the 
subject.” 

He sighed. 

“Tell me if I have anything wrong.” I tried to sound 
detached. “Your demands are marriage” — I couldn’t 
say the word without making a face — “paying my 
tuition, more time, and you wouldn’t mind if my 
vehicle went a little faster.” I raised my eyebrows. “Did 
I get everything? That’s a hefty list.” 

“Only the first is a demand.” He seemed to be having 
a hard time keeping a straight face. “The others are 
merely requests.” 

“And my lone, solitary little demand is — ” 

“Demand?” he interrupted, suddenly serious again. 
“Yes, demand.” 

His eyes narrowed. 

“Getting married is a stretch for me. I’m not giving in 
unless I get something in return.”

He leaned down to whisper in my ear. “No,” he 
murmured silkily. “It’s not possible now. Later, when 
you’re less breakable. Be patient, Bella.” 

I tried to keep my voice firm and reasonable. “But 
that’s the problem. It won’t be the same when I’m less 
breakable. I won’t be the same! I don’t know who I’ll 
be then.” 

“You’ll still be Bella,” he promised. 

I frowned. “If I’m so far gone that I’d want to kill 
Charlie — that I’d drink Jacob’s blood or Angela’s if I 
got the chance — how can that be true?” 

“It will pass. And I doubt you’ll want to drink the 
dog’s blood.” He pretended to shudder at the thought. 
“Even as a newborn, you’ll have better taste than 
that.” 

I ignored his attempt to sidetrack me. “But that will 
always be what I want most, won’t it?” I challenged. 
“Blood, blood, and more blood!” 

“The fact that you are still alive is proof that that is 
not true,” he pointed out. 

“Over eighty years later,” I reminded him. “What I 
meant was physically, though. Intellectually, I know 
I’ll be able to be myself ... after a while. But just 
purely physically — I will always be thirsty, more 
than anything else.” 

He didn’t answer. 

“So I will be different,” I concluded unopposed. 
“Because right now, physically, there’s nothing I want 
more than you. More than food or water or oxygen. 



478 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Intellectually, I have my priorities in a slightly more 
sensible order. But physically ...” 

I twisted my head to kiss the palm of his hand. 

He took a deep breath. I was surprised that it 
sounded a little unsteady. 

“Bella, I could kill you,” he whispered. 

“I don’t think you could.” 

Edward’s eyes tightened. He lifted his hand from my 
face and reached quickly behind himself for 
something I couldn’t see. There was a muffled 
snapping sound, and the bed quivered beneath us. 

Something dark was in his hand; he held it up for my 
curious examination. It was a metal flower, one of the 
roses that adorned the wrought iron posts and 
canopy of his bed frame. His hand closed for a brief 
second, his fingers contracting gently, and then it 
opened again. 

Without a word, he offered me the crushed, uneven 
lump of black metal. It was a cast of the inside of his 
hand, like a piece of play dough squeezed in a child’s 
fist. A half-second passed, and the shape crumbled 
into black sand in his palm. 

I glared. “That’s not what I meant. I already know how 
strong you are. You didn’t have to break the 
furniture.” 

“What did you mean then?” he asked in a dark voice, 
tossing the handful of iron sand to the corner of the 
room; it hit the wall with a sound like rain.

His eyes were intent on my face as I struggled to 
explain. 

“Obviously not that you aren’t physically able hurt 
me, if you wanted to ... More that, you don’t want to 
hurt me ... so much so that I don’t think that you ever 
could.” 

He started shaking his head before I was done. 

“It might not work like that, Bella.” 

“Might,” I scoffed. “You have no more idea what you’re 
talking about than I do.” 

“Exactly. Do you imagine I would ever take that kind 
of risk with you?” 

I stared into his eyes for a long minute. There was no 
sign of compromise, no hint of indecision in them. 

“Please,” I finally whispered, hopeless. “It’s all I want. 
Please.” I closed my eyes in defeat, waiting for the 
quick and final no. 

But he didn’t answer immediately. I hesitated in 
disbelief, stunned to hear that his breathing was 
uneven again. 

I opened my eyes, and his face was torn. 

“Please?” I whispered again, my heartbeat picking up 
speed. My words tumbled out as I rushed to take 
advantage of the sudden uncertainty in his eyes. “You 
don’t have to make me any guarantees. If it doesn’t 
work out right, well, then that’s that. Just let us try 
... only try. And I’ll give you what you want,” I 
promised rashly. “I’ll marry you. I’ll let you pay for 
Dartmouth, and I won’t complain about the bribe to 
480 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




get me in. You can even buy me a fast car if that 
makes you happy! Just ... please.” 



His icy arms tightened around me, and his lips were 
at my ear; his cool breath made me shiver. “This is 
unbearable. So many things I’ve wanted to give you — 
and this is what you decide to demand. Do you have 
any idea how painful it is, trying to refuse you when 
you plead with me this way?” 

“Then don’t refuse,” I suggested breathlessly. 

He didn’t respond. 

“Please,” I tried again. 

“Bella ...” He shook his head slowly, but it didn’t feel 
like a denial as his face, his lips, moved back and 
forth across my throat. It felt more like surrender. My 
heart, racing already, spluttered frantically. 

Again, I took what advantage I could. When his face 
turned toward mine with the slow movement of his 
indecision, I twisted quickly in his arms till my lips 
reached his. His hands seized my face, and I thought 
he was going to push me away again. 

I was wrong. 

His mouth was not gentle; there was a brand-new 
edge of conflict and desperation in the way his lips 
moved. I locked my arms around his neck, and, to my 
suddenly overheated skin, his body felt colder than 
ever. I trembled, but it was not from the chill. 

He didn’t stop kissing me. I was the one who had to 
break away, gasping for air. Even then his lips did not 
leave my skin, they just moved to my throat. The 
thrill of victory was a strange high; it made me feel 

481 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




powerful. Brave. My hands weren’t unsteady now; I 
got through with the buttons on his shirt this time 
easily, and my fingers traced the perfect planes of his 
icy chest. He was too beautiful. What was the word 
he’d used just now? Unbearable — that was it. His 
beauty was too much to bear. . . . 

I pulled his mouth back to mine, and he seemed just 
as eager as I was. One of his hands still cupped my 
face, his other arm was tight around my waist, 
straining me closer to him. It made it slightly more 
difficult as I tried to reach the front of my shirt, but 
not impossible. 

Cold iron fetters locked around my wrists, and pulled 
my hands above my head, which was suddenly on a 
pillow. 

His lips were at my ear again. “Bella,” he murmured, 
his voice warm and velvet. “Would you please stop 
trying to take your clothes off?” 

“Do you want to do that part?” I asked, confused. 

“Not tonight,” he answered softly. His lips were slower 
now against my cheek and jaw, all the urgency gone. 

“Edward, don’t — ,” I started to argue. 

“I’m not saying no,” he reassured me. “I’m just saying 
not tonight.” 

I thought about that while my breathing slowed. 

“Give me one good reason why tonight is not as good 
as any other night.” I was still breathless; it made the 
frustration in my voice less impressive. 



482 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I wasn’t born yesterday.” He chuckled in my ear. 

“Out of the two of us, which do you think is more 
unwilling to give the other what they want? You just 
promised to marry me before you do any changing, 
but if I give in tonight, what guarantee do I have that 
you won’t go running off to Carlisle in the morning? I 
am — clearly — much less reluctant to give you what 
you want. Therefore ... you first.” 

I exhaled with a loud huff. “I have to marry you first?” 
I asked in disbelief. 

“That’s the deal — take it or leave it. Compromise, 
remember?” 

His arms wrapped around me, and he began kissing 
me in a way that should be illegal. Too persuasive — 
it was duress, coercion. I tried to keep a clear head ... 
and failed quickly and absolutely. 

“I think that’s a really bad idea,” I gasped when he let 
me breathe. 

“I’m not surprised you feel that way.” He smirked. 
“You have a one-track mind.” 

“How did this happen?” I grumbled. “I thought I was 
holding my own tonight — for once — and now, all of 
a sudden — ” 

“You’re engaged,” he finished. 

“Ew! Please don’t say that out loud.” 

“Are you going back on your word?” he demanded. He 
pulled away to read my face. His expression was 
entertained. He was having fun. 



483 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I glared at him, trying to ignore the way his smile 
made my heart react. 

“Are you?” he pressed. 

“Ugh!” I groaned. “No. I’m not. Are you happy now?” 
His smile was blinding. “Exceptionally.” 

I groaned again. 

“Aren’t you happy at all?” 

He kissed me again before I could answer. Another 
too-persuasive kiss. 

“A little bit,” I admitted when I could speak. “But not 
about getting married.” 

He kissed me another time. “Do you get the feeling 
that everything is backward?” he laughed in my ear. 
“Traditionally, shouldn’t you be arguing my side, and 
I yours?” 

“There isn’t much that’s traditional about you and 
me.” 

“True.” 

He kissed me again, and kept going until my heart 
was racing and my skin was flushed. 

“Look, Edward,” I murmured, my voice wheedling, 
when he paused to kiss the palm of my hand. “I said I 
would marry you, and I will. I promise. I swear. If you 
want, I’ll sign a contract in my own blood.” 

“Not funny,” he murmured against the inside of my 
wrist. 

484 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“What I’m saying is this — I’m not going to trick you 
or anything. You know me better than that. So there’s 
really no reason to wait. We’re completely alone — 
how often does that happen? — and you’ve provided 
this very large and comfortable bed... .” 

“Not tonight,” he said again. 

“Don’t you trust me?” 

“Of course I do.” 

Using the hand that he was still kissing, I pulled his 
face back up to where I could see his expression. 

“Then what’s the problem? It’s not like you didn’t 
know you were going to win in the end.” I frowned 
and muttered, “You always win.” 

“Just hedging my bets,” he said calmly. 

“There’s something else,” I guessed, my eyes 
narrowing. There was a defensiveness about his face, 
a faint hint of some secret motive he was trying to 
hide behind his casual manner. “Are you planning to 
go back on your word?” 

“No,” he promised solemnly. “I swear to you, we will 
try. After you marry me.” 

I shook my head, and laughed glumly. “You make me 
feel like a villain in a melodrama — twirling my 
mustache while I try to steal some poor girl’s virtue.” 

His eyes were wary as they flashed across my face, 
then he quickly ducked down to press his lips against 
my collarbone. 



485 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“That’s it, isn’t it?” The short laugh that escaped me 
was more shocked than amused. “You’re trying to 
protect your virtue!” I covered my mouth with my 
hand to muffle the giggle that followed. The words 
were so ... old-fashioned. 

“No, silly girl,” he muttered against my shoulder. “I’m 
trying to protect yours. And you’re making it 
shockingly difficult.” 

“Of all the ridiculous — ” 

“Let me ask you something,” he interrupted quickly. 
“We’ve had this discussion before, but humor me. 
How many people in this room have a soul? A shot at 
heaven, or whatever there is after this life?” 

“Two,” I answered immediately, my voice fierce. 

“All right. Maybe that’s true. Now, there’s a world full 
of dissension about this, but the vast majority seem 
to think that there are some rules that have to be 
followed.” 

“Vampire rules aren’t enough for you? You want to 
worry about the human ones too?” 

“It couldn’t hurt.” He shrugged. “Just in case.” 

I glared at him through narrowed eyes. 

“Now, of course, it might be too late for me, even if 
you are right about my soul.” 

“No, it isn’t,” I argued angrily. 

“Thou shalt not kill’ is commonly accepted by most 
major belief systems. And I’ve killed a lot of people, 
Bella.” 

486 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Only the bad ones.” 

He shrugged. “Maybe that counts, maybe it doesn’t. 
But you haven’t killed anyone — ” 

“That you know about,” I muttered. 

He smiled, but otherwise ignored the interruption. 
“And I’m going to do my best to keep you out of 
temptation’s way.” 

“Okay. But we weren’t fighting over committing 
murder,” I reminded him. 

“The same principle applies — the only difference is 
that this is the one area in which I’m just as spotless 
as you are. Can’t I leave one rule unbroken?” 

“One?” 

“You know that I’ve stolen, I’ve lied, I’ve coveted ... my 
virtue is all I have left.” He grinned crookedly. 

“I lie all the time.” 

“Yes, but you’re such a bad liar that it doesn’t really 
count. Nobody believes you.” 

“I really hope you’re wrong about that — because 
otherwise Charlie is about to burst through the door 
with a loaded gun.” 

“Charlie is happier when he pretends to swallow your 
stories. He’d rather lie to himself than look too 
closely.” He grinned at me. 

“But what did you ever covet?” I asked doubtfully. 
“You have everything.” 



487 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I coveted you.” His smile darkened. “I had no right to 
want you — but I reached out and took you anyway. 
And now look what’s become of you! Trying to seduce 
a vampire.” He shook his head in mock horror. 

“You can covet what’s already yours,” I informed him. 
“Besides, I thought it was my virtue you were worried 
about.” 

“It is. If it’s too late for me ... Well, I’ll be damned — 
no pun intended — if I’ll let them keep you out, too.” 

“You can’t make me go somewhere you won’t be,” I 
vowed. “That’s my definition of hell. Anyway, I have 
an easy solution to all this: let’s never die, all right?” 

“Sounds simple enough. Why didn’t I think of that?” 

He smiled at me until I gave up with an angry 
humph. “So that’s it. You won’t sleep with me until 
we’re married.” 

“Technically, I can’t ever sleep with you.” 

I rolled my eyes. “Very mature, Edward.” 

“But, other than that detail, yes, you’ve got it right.” 

“I think you have an ulterior motive.” 

His eyes widened innocently. “Another one?” 

“You know this will speed things up,” I accused. 

He tried not to smile. “There is only one thing I want 
to speed up, and the rest can wait forever . . . but for 
that, it’s true, your impatient human hormones are 
my most powerful ally at this point.” 



488 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I can’t believe I’m going along with this. When I think 
of Charlie ... and Renee! Can you imagine what 
Angela will think? Or Jessica? Ugh. I can hear the 
gossip now.” 

He raised one eyebrow at me, and I knew why. What 
did it matter what they said about me when I leaving 
soon and not coming back? Was I really so 
oversensitive that I couldn’t bear a few weeks of 
sidelong glances and leading questions? 

Maybe it wouldn’t bug me so much if I didn’t know 
that I would probably be gossiping just as 
condescendingly as the rest of them if it was someone 
else getting married this summer. 

Gah. Married this summer! I shuddered. 

And then, maybe it wouldn’t bug me so much if I 
hadn’t been raised to shudder at the thought of 
marriage. 

Edward interrupted my fretting. “It doesn’t have to be 
a big production. I don’t need any fanfare. You won’t 
have to tell anyone or make any changes. We’ll go to 
Vegas — you can wear old jeans and we’ll go to the 
chapel with the drive-through window. I just want it 
to be official — that you belong to me and no one 
else.” 

“It couldn’t be any more official than it already is,” I 
grumbled. But his description didn’t sound that bad. 
Only Alice would be disappointed. 

“Well see about that.” He smiled complacently. “I 
suppose you don’t want your ring now?” 

I had to swallow before I could speak. “You suppose 
correctly.” 

489 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He laughed at my expression. “That’s fine. I’ll get it on 
your finger soon enough.” 

I glared at him. “You talk like you already have one.” 

“I do,” he said, unashamed. “Ready to force upon you 
at the first sign of weakness.” 

“You’re unbelievable.” 

“Do you want to see it?” he asked. His liquid topaz 
eyes were suddenly shining with excitement. 

“No!” I almost shouted, a reflex reaction. I regretted it 
at once. His face fell ever so slightly. “Unless you 
really want to show it to me,” I amended. I gritted my 
teeth together to keep my illogical terror from 
showing. 

“That’s all right,” he shrugged. “It can wait.” 

I sighed. “Show me the damn ring, Edward.” 

He shook his head. “No.” 

I studied his expression for a long minute. 

“Please?” I asked quietly, experimenting with my 
newly discovered weapon. I touched his face lightly 
with the tips of my fingers. “Please can I see it?” 

His eyes narrowed. “You are the most dangerous 
creature I’ve ever met,” he muttered. But he got up 
and moved with unconscious grace to kneel next to 
the small bedside table. He was back on the bed with 
me in an instant, sitting beside me with one arm 
around my shoulder. In his other hand was a little 
black box. He balanced it on my left knee. 



490 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Go ahead and look, then,” he said brusquely. 



It was harder than it should have been to pick up the 
inoffensive little box, but I didn’t want to hurt him 
again, so I tried to keep my hand from shaking. The 
surface was smooth with black satin. I brushed my 
fingers over it, hesitating. 

“You didn’t spend a lot of money, did you? Lie to me, 
if you did.” 

“I didn’t spend anything,” he assured me. “It’s just 
another hand-me-down. This is the ring my father 
gave to my mother.” 

“Oh.” Surprise colored my voice. I pinched the lid 
between my thumb and forefinger, but didn’t open it. 

“I supposed it’s a little outdated.” His tone was 
playfully apologetic. “Old-fashioned, just like me. I 
can get you something more modern. Something from 
Tiffany’s?” 

“I like old-fashioned things,” I mumbled as I 
hesitantly lifted the lid. 

Nestled into the black satin, Elizabeth Masen’s ring 
sparkled in the dim light. The face was a long oval, 
set with slanting rows of glittering round stones. The 
band was gold — delicate and narrow. The gold made 
a fragile web around the diamonds. I’d never seen 
anything like it. 

Unthinkingly, I stroked the shimmering gems. 

“It’s so pretty,” I murmured to myself, surprised. 

“Do you like it?” 



491 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“It’s beautiful.” I shrugged, feigning a lack of interest. 
“What’s not to like?” 

He chuckled. “See if it fits.” 

My left hand clenched into a fist. 

“Bella,” he sighed. “I’m not going to solder it to your 
finger. Just try it on so I can see if it needs to be 
sized. Then you can take it right off.” 

“Fine,” I grumbled. 

I reached for the ring, but his long fingers beat me 
there. He took my left hand in his, and slid the ring 
into place on my third finger. He held my hand out, 
and we both examined the oval sparkling against my 
skin. It wasn’t quite as awful as I’d feared, having it 
there. 

“A perfect fit,” he said indifferently. “That’s nice — 
saves me a trip to the jeweler’s.” 

I could hear some strong emotion burning under the 
casual tone of his voice, and I stared up at his face. It 
was there in his eyes, too, visible despite the careful 
nonchalance of his expression. 

“You like that, don’t you?” I asked suspiciously, 
fluttering my fingers and thinking that it was really 
too bad that I had not broken my left hand. 

He shrugged his shoulders. “Sure,” he said, still 
casual. “It looks very nice on you.” 

I stared into his eyes, trying to decipher the emotion 
that smoldered just under the surface. He gazed 
back, and the casual pretense suddenly slipped away. 
He was glowing — his angel’s face brilliant with joy 

492 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




and victory. He was so glorious that it knocked me 
breathless. 

Before I could catch that breath, he was kissing me, 
his lips exultant. I was lightheaded when he moved 
his mouth to whisper in my ear — but his breathing 
was just as ragged as mine. 

“Yes, I like it. You have no idea.” 

I laughed, gasping a little. “I believe you.” 

“Do you mind if I do something?” he murmured, his 
arms tightening around me. 

“Anything you want.” 

But he let me go and slid away. 

“Anything but that,” I complained. 

He ignored me, taking my hand and pulling me off the 
bed, too. He stood in front of me, hands on my 
shoulders, face serious. 

“Now, I want to do this right. Please, please, keep in 
mind that you’ve already agreed to this, and don’t 
ruin it for me.” 

“Oh, no,” I gasped as he slid down onto one knee. 

“Be nice,” he muttered. 

I took a deep breath. 

“Isabella Swan?” He looked up at me through his 
impossibly long lashes, his golden eyes soft but, 
somehow, still scorching. “I promise to love you

forever — every single day of forever. Will you marry 
me?” 

There were many things I wanted to say, some of 
them not nice at all, and others more disgustingly 
gooey and romantic than he probably dreamed I was 
capable of. Rather than embarrass myself with either, 
I whispered, “Yes.” 

“Thank you,” he said simply. He took my left hand 
and kissed each of my fingertips before he kissed the 
ring that was now mine.

I hated to waste any part of the night in sleep, but 
that was inevitable. The sun was bright outside the 
window-wall when I woke, with small clouds scuttling 
too quickly across the sky. The wind rocked the 
treetops till the whole forest looked as if it was going 
to shake apart. 

He left me alone to get dressed, and I appreciated the 
chance to think. Somehow, my plan for last night had 
gone horribly awry, and I needed come to grips with 
the consequences. Though I’d given back the hand- 
me-down ring as soon as I could do it without hurting 
his feelings, my left hand felt heavier, like it was still 
in place, just invisible. 

This shouldn’t bother me, I reasoned. It was no big 
thing — a road trip to Vegas. I would go one better 
than old jeans — I would wear old sweats. The 
ceremony certainly couldn’t take very long; no more 
than fifteen minutes at the most, right? So I could 
handle that. 

And then, when it was over, he’d have to fulfill his 
side of the bargain. I would concentrate on that, and 
forget the rest. 

He said I didn’t have to tell anyone, and I was 
planning to hold him to that. Of course, it was very 
stupid of me not to think of Alice. 

The Cullens got home around noon. There was a new, 
businesslike feel to the atmosphere around them, and 
it pulled me back into the enormity of what was 
coming. 

495 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



Alice seemed to be in an unusually bad mood. I 
chalked it up to her frustration with feeling normal, 
because her first words to Edward were a complaint 
about working with the wolves. 

“I think” — she made a face as she used the 
uncertain word — “that you’re going to want to pack 
for cold weather, Edward. I can’t see where you are 
exactly, because you’re taking off with that dog this 
afternoon. But the storm that’s coming seems 
particularly bad in that general area.” 

Edward nodded. 

“It’s going to snow on the mountains,” she warned 
him. 

“Ew, snow,” I muttered to myself. It was June, for 
crying out loud. 

“Wear a jacket,” Alice told me. Her voice was 
unfriendly, and that surprised me. I tried to read her 
face, but she turned away. 

I looked at Edward, and he was smiling; whatever was 
bugging Alice amused him. 

Edward had more than enough camping gear to 
choose from — props in the human charade; the 
Cullens were good customers at the Newton’s store. 

He grabbed a down sleeping bag, a small tent, and 
several packets of dehydrated food — grinning when I 
made a face at them — and stuffed them all in a 
backpack. 

Alice wandered into the garage while we were there, 
watching Edward’s preparations without a word. He 
ignored her.

When he was done packing, Edward handed me his 
phone. “Why don’t you call Jacob and tell him we’ll be 
ready for him in an hour or so. He knows where to 
meet us.” 

Jacob wasn’t home, but Billy promised to call around 
until he could find an available werewolf to pass the 
news to. 

“Don’t you worry about Charlie, Bella,” Billy said. “I’ve 
got my part of this under control.” 

“Yeah, I know Charlie’ll be fine.” I didn’t feel so 
confident about his son’s safety, but I didn’t add that. 

“I wish I could be with the rest of them tomorrow.” 
Billy chuckled regretfully. “Being an old man is a 
hardship, Bella.” 

The urge to fight must be a defining characteristic of 
the Y chromosome. They were all the same. 

“Have fun with Charlie.” 

“Good luck, Bella,” he answered. “And ... pass that 
along to the, er, Cullens for me.” 

“I will,” I promised, surprised by the gesture. 

As I gave the phone back to Edward, I saw that he 
and Alice were having some kind of silent discussion. 
She was staring at him, pleading in her eyes. He was 
frowning back, unhappy with whatever she wanted. 

“Billy said to tell you ‘good luck. ’” 

“That was generous of him,” Edward said, breaking 
away from her.

“Bella, could I please speak to you alone?” Alice asked 
swiftly. 

“You’re about to make my life harder than it needs to 
be, Alice,” Edward warned her through his teeth. “I’d 
really rather you didn’t.” 

“This isn’t about you, Edward,” she shot back. 

He laughed. Something about her response was funny 
to him. 

“It’s not,” Alice insisted. “This is a female thing.” 

He frowned. 

“Let her talk to me,” I told him. I was curious. 

“You asked for it,” he muttered. He laughed again — 
half angry, half amused — and strode out of the 
garage. 

I turned to Alice, worried now, but she didn’t look at 
me. Her bad mood hadn’t passed yet. 

She went to sit on the hood of her Porsche, her face 
dejected. I followed, and leaned against the bumper 
beside her. 

“Bella?” Alice asked in a sad voice, shifting over and 
curling up against my side. Her voice sounded so 
miserable that I wrapped my arms around her 
shoulders in comfort. 

“What’s wrong, Alice?” 

“Don’t you love me?” she asked in that same sad tone. 

“Of course I do. You know that.”

“Then why do I see you sneaking off to Vegas to get 
married without inviting me?” 

“Oh,” I muttered, my cheeks turning pink. I could see 
that I had seriously hurt her feelings, and I hurried to 
defend myself. “You know how I hate to make a big 
deal out of things. It was Edward’s idea, anyway.” 

“I don’t care whose idea it was. How could you do this 
to me? I expect that kind of thing from Edward, but 
not from you. I love you like you were my own sister.” 

“To me, Alice, you are my sister.” 

“Words!” she growled. 

“Fine, you can come. There won’t be much to see.” 

She was still grimacing. 

“What?” I demanded. 

“How much do you love me, Bella?” 

“Why?” 

She stared at me with pleading eyes, her long black 
eyebrows slanting up in the middle and pulling 
together, her lips trembling at the corners. It was a 
heart-breaking expression. 

“Please, please, please,” she whispered. “Please, Bella, 
please — if you really love me . . . Please let me do your 
wedding.” 

“Aw, Alice!” I groaned, pulling away and standing up. 
“No! Don’t do this to me.” 

“If you really, truly love me, Bella.”

I folded my arms across my chest. “That is so unfair. 
And Edward kind of already used that one on me.” 

“I’ll bet Edward would like it better if you did this 
traditionally, though he’d never tell you that. And 
Esme — think what it would mean to her!” 

I groaned. “I’d rather face the newborns alone.” 

“I’ll owe you for a decade.” 

“You’d owe me for a century!” 

Her eyes glowed. “Is that a yes?” 

“No! I don’t want to do this!” 

“You won’t have to do anything but walk a few yards 
and then repeat after the minister.” 

“Ugh! Ugh, ugh!” 

“Please?” She started bouncing in place. “Please, 
please, please, please, please?” 

“I’ll never, never ever forgive you for this, Alice.” 

“Yay!” she squealed, clapping her hands together. 

“That’s not a yes!” 

“But it will be,” she sang. 

“Edward!” I yelled, stalking out of the garage. “I know 
you’re listening. Get over here.” Alice was right behind 
me, still clapping. 

“Thanks so much, Alice,” Edward said acidly, coming 
from behind me. I turned to let him have it, but his 

500 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




expression was so worried and upset that I couldn’t 
speak my complaints. I threw my arms around him 
instead, hiding my face, just in case the angry 
moisture in my eyes made it look like I was crying. 

“Vegas,” Edward promised in my ear. 

“Not a chance,” Alice gloated. “Bella would never do 
that to me. You know, Edward, as a brother, you are 
sometimes a disappointment.” 

“Don’t be mean,” I grumbled at her. “He’s trying to 
make me happy, unlike you.” 

“I’m trying to make you happy, too, Bella. It’s just 
that I know better what will make you happy ... in the 
long run. You’ll thank me for this. Maybe not for fifty 
years, but definitely someday.” 

“I never thought I’d see the day where I’d be willing to 
take a bet against you, Alice, but it has arrived.” 

She laughed her silvery laugh. “So, are you going to 
show me the ring?” 

I grimaced in horror as she grabbed my left hand and 
then dropped it just as quickly. 

“Huh. I saw him put it on you... . Did I miss 
something?” she asked. She concentrated for half a 
second, furrowing her brow, before she answered her 
own questions. “No. Wedding’s still on.” 

“Bella has issues with jewelry,” Edward explained. 

“What’s one more diamond? Well, I guess the ring has 
lots of diamonds, but my point is that he’s already got 
one on — ” 



501 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Enough, Alice!” Edward cut her off suddenly. The 
way he glared at her ... he looked like a vampire 
again. “We’re in a hurry.” 

“I don’t understand. What’s that about diamonds?” I 
asked. 

“Well talk about it later,” Alice said. “Edward is right 
— you’d better get going. You’ve got to set a trap and 
make camp before the storm comes.” She frowned, 
and her expression was anxious, almost nervous. 
“Don’t forget your coat, Bella. It seems ... 
unseasonably cold.” 

“I’ve already got it,” Edward assured her. 

“Have a nice night,” she told us in farewell. 

It was twice as far to the clearing as usual; Edward 
took a long detour, making sure my scent would be 
nowhere near the trail Jacob would hide later. He 
carried me in his arms, the bulky backpack in my 
usual spot. 

He stopped at the farthest end of the clearing and set 
me on my feet. 

“All right. Just walk north for a ways, touching as 
much as you can. Alice gave me a clear picture of 
their path, and it won’t take long for us to intersect 
it.” 

“North?” 

He smiled and pointed out the right direction. 

I wandered into the woods, leaving the clear yellow 
light of the strangely sunny day in the clearing behind 
me. Maybe Alice’s blurred sight would be wrong about 

502 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




the snow. I hoped so. The sky was mostly clear, 
though the wind whipped furiously through the open 
spaces. In the trees it was calmer, but much too cold 
for June — even in a long-sleeved shirt with a thick 
sweater over the top, there were goose bumps on my 
arms. I walked slowly, trailing my fingers over 
anything close enough: the rough tree bark, the wet 
ferns, the moss-covered rocks. 

Edward stayed with me, walking a parallel line about 
twenty yards away. 

“Am I doing this right?” I called. 

“Perfectly.” 

I had an idea. “Will this help?” I asked as I ran my 
fingers through my hair and caught a few loose 
strands. I draped them over the ferns. 

“Yes, that does make the trail stronger. But you don’t 
need to pull your hair out, Bella. It will be fine.” 

“I’ve got a few extras I can spare.” 

It was gloomy under the trees, and I wished I could 
walk closer to Edward and hold his hand. 

I wedged another hair into a broken branch that cut 
through my path. 

“You don’t need to let Alice have her way, you know,” 
Edward said. 

“Don’t worry about it, Edward. I’m not going to leave 
you at the altar, regardless.” I had a sinking feeling 
that Alice was going to get her way, mostly because 
she was totally unscrupulous when there was 



503 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




something she wanted, and also because I was a 
sucker for guilt trips. 

“That’s not what I’m worried about. I want this to be 
what you want it to be.” 

I repressed a sigh. It would hurt his feelings if I told 
the truth — that it didn’t really matter, because it was 
all just varying degrees of awful anyway. 

“Well, even if she does get her way, we can keep it 
small. Just us. Emmett can get a clerical license off 
the Internet.” 

I giggled. “That does sound better.” It wouldn’t feel 
very official if Emmett read the vows, which was a 
plus. But I’d have a hard time keeping a straight face. 

“See,” he said with a smile. “There’s always a 
compromise.” 

It took a while for me to reach the spot where the 
newborn army would be certain to cross my trail, but 
Edward never got impatient with my pace. 

He had to lead a bit more on the way back, to keep 
me on the same path. It all looked alike to me. 

We were almost to the clearing when I fell. I could see 
the wide opening ahead, and that’s probably why I got 
too eager and forgot to watch my feet. I caught myself 
before my head bashed into the nearest tree, but a 
small branch snapped off under my left hand and 
gouged into my palm. 

“Ouch! Oh, fabulous,” I muttered. 

“Are you all right?” 



504 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




‘Tm fine. Stay where you are. I’m bleeding. It will stop 
in a minute.” 

He ignored me. He was right there before I could 
finish. 

“I’ve got a first aid kit,” he said, pulling off the 
backpack. “I had a feeling I might need it.” 

“It’s not bad. I can take care of it — you don’t have to 
make yourself uncomfortable.” 

“I’m not uncomfortable,” he said calmly. “Here — let 
me clean it.” 

“Wait a second, I just got another idea.” 

Without looking at the blood and breathing through 
my mouth, just in case my stomach might react, I 
pressed my hand against a rock within my reach. 

“What are you doing?” 

“Jasper will love this,” I muttered to myself. I started 
for the clearing again, pressing my palm against 
everything in my path. “I’ll bet this really gets them 
going.” 

Edward sighed. 

“Hold your breath,” I told him. 

“I’m fine. I just think you’re going overboard.” 

“This is all I get to do. I want to do a good job.” 

We broke through the last of the trees as I spoke. I let 
my injured hand graze across the ferns. 



505 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Well, you have,” Edward assured me. “The newborns 
will be frantic, and Jasper will be very impressed with 
your dedication. Now let me treat your hand — you’ve 
gotten the cut dirty.” 

“Let me do it, please.” 

He took my hand and smiled as he examined it. “This 
doesn’t bother me anymore.” 

I watched him carefully as he cleaned the gash, 
looking for some sign of distress. He continued to 
breathe evenly in and out, the same small smile on 
his lips. 

“Why not?” I finally asked as he smoothed a bandage 
across my palm. 

He shrugged. “I got over it.” 

“You . . . got over it? When? How?” I tried to remember 
the last time he’d held his breath around me. All I 
could think of was my wretched birthday party last 
September. 

Edward pursed his lips, seeming to search for the 
words. “I lived through an entire twenty-four hours 
thinking that you were dead, Bella. That changed the 
way I look at a lot of things.” 

“Did it change the way I smell to you?” 

“Not at all. But ... having experienced the way it feels 
to think I’ve lost you ... my reactions have changed. 
My entire being shies away from any course that 
could inspire that kind of pain again.” 

I didn’t know what to say to that. 



506 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He smiled at my expression. “I guess that you could 
call it a very educational experience.” 

The wind tore through the clearing then, lashing my 
hair around my face and making me shiver. 

“All right,” he said, reaching into his pack again. 
“You’ve done your part.” He pulled out my heavy 
winter jacket and held it out for me to slide my arms 
in. “Now it’s out of our hands. Let’s go camping!” 

I laughed at the mock enthusiasm in his voice. 

He took my bandaged hand — the other was in worse 
shape, still in the brace — and started toward the 
other side of the clearing. 

“Where are we meeting Jacob?” I asked. 

“Right here.” He gestured to the trees in front of us 
just as Jacob stepped warily from their shadows. 

It shouldn’t have surprised me to see him human. I 
wasn’t sure why I’d been looking for the big red- 
brown wolf. 

Jacob seemed bigger again — no doubt a product of 
my expectations; I must have unconsciously been 
hoping to see the smaller Jacob from my memory, the 
easygoing friend who hadn’t made everything so 
difficult. He had his arms folded across his bare 
chest, a jacket clutched in one fist. His face was 
expressionless as he watched us. 

Edward’s lips pulled down at the corners. “There had 
to have been a better way to do this.” 

“Too late now,” I muttered glumly. 



507 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He sighed. 



“Hey, Jake,” I greeted him when we got closer. 

“Hi, Bella.” 

“Hello, Jacob,” Edward said. 

Jacob ignored the pleasantry, all business. “Where do 
I take her?” 

Edward pulled a map from a side pocket on the pack 
and offered it to him. Jacob unfolded it. 

“We’re here now,” Edward said, reaching over to 
touch the right spot. Jacob recoiled from his hand 
automatically, and then steadied himself. Edward 
pretended not to notice. 

“And you’re taking her up here,” Edward continued, 
tracing a serpentine pattern around the elevation 
lines on the paper. “Roughly nine miles.” 

Jacob nodded once. 

“When you’re about a mile away, you should cross my 
path. That will lead you in. Do you need the map?” 

“No, thanks. I know this area pretty well. I think I 
know where I’m going.” 

Jacob seemed to have to work harder than Edward to 
keep the tone polite. 

“I’ll take a longer route,” Edward said. “And I’ll see 
you in a few hours.” 

Edward stared at me unhappily. He didn’t like this 
part of the plan. 

508 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“See you,” I murmured. 



Edward faded into the trees, heading in the opposite 
direction. 

As soon as he was gone, Jacob turned cheerful. 

“What’s up, Bella?” he asked with a big grin. 

I rolled my eyes. “Same old, same old.” 

“Yeah,” he agreed. “Bunch of vampires trying to kill 
you. The usual.” 

“The usual.” 

“Well,” he said as he shrugged into his jacket to free 
his arms. “Let’s get going.” 

Making a face, I took a small step closer to him. 

He bent down and swept his arm behind my knees, 
knocking them out from under me. His other arm 
caught me before my head hit the ground. 

“Jerk,” I muttered. 

Jacob chuckled, already running through the trees. 

He kept a steady pace, a brisk jog that a fit human 
could keep up with ... across a level plane ... if they 
weren’t burdened with a hundred-plus pounds as he 
was. 

“You don’t have to run. You’ll get tired.” 

“Running doesn’t make me tired,” he said. His 
breathing was even — like the fixed tempo of a 
marathoner. “Besides, it will be colder soon. I hope he 
gets the camp set up before we get there.” 

509 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I tapped my finger against the thick padding of his 
parka. “I thought you didn’t get cold now.” 



“I don’t. I brought this for you, just in case you 
weren’t prepared.” He looked at my jacket, almost as 
if he were disappointed that I was. “I don’t like the 
way the weather feels. It’s making me edgy. Notice 
how we haven’t seen any animals?” 

“Um, not really.” 

“I guess you wouldn’t. Your senses are too dull.” 

I let that pass. “Alice was worried about the storm, 
too.” 

“It takes a lot to silence the forest this way. You 
picked a hell of a night for a camping trip.” 

“It wasn’t entirely my idea.” 

The pathless way he took began to climb more and 
more steeply, but it didn’t slow him down. He leapt 
easily from rock to rock, not seeming to need his 
hands at all. His perfect balance reminded me of a 
mountain goat. 

“What’s with the addition to your bracelet?” he asked. 

I looked down, and realized that the crystal heart was 
facing up on my wrist. 

I shrugged guiltily. “Another graduation present.” 

He snorted. “A rock. Figures.” 

A rock? I was suddenly reminded of Alice’s unfinished 
sentence outside the garage. I stared at the bright 
white crystal and tried to remember what Alice had 

510 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




been saying before ... about diamonds. Could she 
have been trying to say he’s already got one on you? 
As in, I was already wearing one diamond from 
Edward? No, that was impossible. The heart would 
have to be five carats or something crazy like that! 
Edward wouldn’t — 

“So it’s been a while since you came down to La 
Push,” Jacob said, interrupting my disturbing 
conjectures. 

“I’ve been busy,” I told him. “And ... I probably 
wouldn’t have visited, anyway.” 

He grimaced. “I thought you were supposed to be the 
forgiving one, and I was the grudge-holder.” 

I shrugged. 

“Been thinking about that last time a lot, have you?” 
“Nope.” 

He laughed. “Either you’re lying, or you are the 
stubbornest person alive.” 

“I don’t know about the second part, but I’m not 
lying.” 

I didn’t like having this conversation under the 
present conditions — with his too-warm arms 
wrapped tightly around me and nothing at all I could 
do about it. His face was closer than I wanted it to be. 
I wished I could take a step back. 

“A smart person looks at all sides of a decision.” 

“I have,” I retorted. 



511 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“If you haven’t thought at all about our ... er, 
conversation the last time you came over, then that’s 
not true.” 

“That conversation isn’t relevant to my decision.” 

“Some people will go to any lengths to delude 
themselves.” 

“I’ve noticed that werewolves in particular are prone 
to that mistake — do you think it’s a genetic thing?” 

“Does that mean that he’s a better kisser that I am?” 
Jacob asked, suddenly glum. 

“I really couldn’t say, Jake. Edward is the only person 
I’ve ever kissed.” 

“Besides me.” 

“But I don’t count that as a kiss, Jacob. I think of it 
more as an assault.” 

“Ouch! That’s cold.” 

I shrugged. I wasn’t going to take it back. 

“I did apologize about that,” he reminded me. 

“And I forgave you ... mostly. It doesn’t change the 
way I remember it.” 

He muttered something unintelligible. 

It was quiet then for a while; there was just the sound 
of his measured breathing and the wind roaring high 
above us in the treetops. A cliff face rose sheer beside 
us, bare, rough gray stone. We followed the base as it 
curved upward out of the forest. 

512 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I still think it’s pretty irresponsible,” Jacob suddenly 
said. 



“Whatever you’re talking about, you’re wrong.” 

“Think about it, Bella. According to you, you’ve kissed 
just one person — who isn’t even really a person — in 
your whole life, and you’re calling it quits? How do 
you know that’s what you want? Shouldn’t you play 
the field a little?” 

I kept my voice cool. “I know exactly what I want.” 

“Then it couldn’t hurt to double check. Maybe you 
should try kissing someone else — just for 
comparison’s sake . . . since what happened the other 
day doesn’t count. You could kiss me, for example. I 
don’t mind if you want to use me to experiment.” 

He pulled me tighter against his chest, so that my 
face was closer to his. He was smiling at his joke, but 
I wasn’t taking any chances. 

“Don’t mess with me, Jake. I swear I won’t stop him if 
he wants to break your jaw.” 

The panicky edge to my voice made him smile wider. 
“If you ask me to kiss you, he won’t have any reason 
to get upset. He said that was fine.” 

“Don’t hold your breath, Jake — no, wait, I changed 
my mind. Go right ahead. Just hold your breath until 
I ask you to kiss me.” 

“You’re in a bad mood today.” 

“I wonder why?” 

“Sometimes I think you like me better as a wolf.” 

513 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Sometimes I do. It probably has something to do with 
the way you can’t talk.” 

He pursed his broad lips thoughtfully. “No, I don’t 
think that’s it. I think it’s easier for you to be near me 
when I’m not human, because you don’t have to 
pretend that you’re not attracted to me.” 

My mouth fell open with a little popping sound. I 
snapped it shut at once, grinding my teeth together. 

He heard that. His lips pulled tightly across his face 
in a triumphant smile. 

I took a slow breath before I spoke. “No. I’m pretty 
sure it’s because you can’t talk.” 

He sighed. “Do you ever get tired of lying to yourself? 
You have to know how aware you are of me. 

Physically, I mean.” 

“How could anyone not be aware of you physically, 
Jacob?” I demanded. “You’re an enormous monster 
who refuses to respect anyone else’s personal space.” 

“I make you nervous. But only when I’m human. 

When I’m a wolf, you’re more comfortable around 
me.” 

“Nervousness and irritation are not the same thing.” 

He stared at me for a minute, slowing to a walk, the 
amusement draining from his face. His eyes 
narrowed, turned black in the shadow of his brows. 
His breathing, so regular as he ran, started to 
accelerate. Slowly, he leaned his face closer to mine. 

I stared him down, knowing exactly what he was 
trying to do. 

514 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“It’s your face,” I reminded him. 

He laughed loudly and started jogging again. “I don’t 
really want to fight with your vampire tonight — I 
mean, any other night, sure. But we both have a job 
to do tomorrow, and I wouldn’t want to leave the 
Cullens one short.” 

The sudden, unexpected swell of shame distorted my 
expression. 

“I know, I know,” he responded, not understanding. 
“You think he could take me.” 

I couldn’t speak. I was leaving them one short. What 
if someone got hurt because I was so weak? But what 
if I was brave and Edward ... I couldn’t even think it. 

“What’s the matter with you, Bella?” The joking 
bravado vanished from his face, revealing my Jacob 
underneath, like pulling a mask away. “If something I 
said upset you, you know I was only kidding. I didn’t 
mean anything — hey, are you okay? Don’t cry, 
Bella,” he pled. 

I tried to pull myself together. “I’m not going to cry.” 
“What did I say?” 

“It’s nothing you said. It’s just, well, it’s me. I did 
something ... bad.” 

He stared at me, his eyes wide with confusion. 

“Edward isn’t going to fight tomorrow,” I whispered 
the explanation. “I’m making him stay with me. I am 
a huge coward.” 



515 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He frowned. “You think this isn’t going to work? That 
they’ll find you here? Do you know something I don’t 
know?” 

“No, no. I’m not afraid of that. I just ... I can’t let him 
go. If he didn’t come back ...” I shuddered, closing my 
eyes to escape the thought. 

Jacob was quiet. 

I kept whispering, my eyes shut. “If anyone gets hurt, 
it will always be my fault. And even if no one does ... I 
was horrible. I had to be, to convince him to stay with 
me. He won’t hold it against me, but I’ll always know 
what I’m capable of.” I felt just a tiny bit better, 
getting this off my chest. Even if I could only confess 
it to Jacob. 

He snorted. My eyes opened slowly, and I was sad to 
see that the hard mask was back. 

“I can’t believe he let you talk him out of going. I 
wouldn’t miss this for anything.” 

I sighed. “I know.” 

“That doesn’t mean anything, though.” He was 
suddenly backtracking. “That doesn’t mean that he 
loves you more than I do.” 

“But you wouldn’t stay with me, even if I begged.” 

He pursed his lips for a moment, and I wondered if he 
would try to deny it. We both knew the truth. “That’s 
only because I know you better,” he said at last. 
“Everything’s going to go without a hitch. Even if 
you’d asked and I’d said no, you wouldn’t be mad at 
me afterwards.” 



516 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“If everything does go without a hitch, you’re probably 
right. I wouldn’t be mad. But the whole time you’re 
gone, I’ll be sick with worry, Jake. Crazy with it.” 

“Why?” he asked gruffly. “Why does it matter to you if 
something happens to me?” 

“Don’t say that. You know how much you mean to 
me. I’m sorry it’s not in the way you want, but that’s 
just how it is. You’re my best friend. At least, you 
used to be. And still sometimes are ... when you let 
your guard down.” 

He smiled the old smile that I loved. “I’m always that,” 
he promised. “Even when I don’t ... behave as well as 
I should. Underneath, I’m always in here.” 

“I know. Why else would I put up with all of your 
crap?” 

He laughed with me, and then his eyes were sad. 
“When are you finally going to figure out that you’re 
in love with me, too?” 

“Leave it to you to ruin the moment.” 

“I’m not saying you don’t love him. I’m not stupid. But 
it’s possible to love more than one person at a time, 
Bella. I’ve seen it in action.” 

“I’m not some freaky werewolf, Jacob.” 

He wrinkled his nose, and I was about to apologize for 
that last jab, but he changed the subject. 

“We’re not far now, I can smell him.” 

I sighed in relief.

He misinterpreted my meaning. “I’d happily slow 
down, Bella, but you’re going to want to be under 
shelter before that hits.” 

We both looked up at the sky. 

A solid wall of purple-black cloud was racing in from 
the west, blackening the forest beneath it as it came. 

“Wow,” I muttered. “You’d better hurry, Jake. You’ll 
want to get home before it gets here.” 

“I’m not going home.” 

I glared at him, exasperated. “You’re not camping 
with us.” 

“Not technically — as in, sharing your tent or 
anything. I prefer the storm to the smell. But I’m sure 
your bloodsucker will want to keep in touch with the 
pack for coordination purposes, and so I will 
graciously provide that service.” 

“I thought that was Seth’s job.” 

“He’ll take over tomorrow, during the fight.” 

The reminder silenced me for a second. I stared at 
him, worry springing up again with sudden 
fierceness. 

“I don’t suppose there’s any way you’d just stay since 
you’re already here?” I suggested. “If I did beg? Or 
trade back the lifetime of servitude or something?” 

“Tempting, but no. Then again, the begging might be 
interesting to see. You can give it a go if you like.” 

“There’s really nothing, nothing at all I can say?”

“Nope. Not unless you can promise me a better fight. 
Anyway, Sam’s calling the shots, not me.” 

That reminded me. 

“Edward told me something the other day . . . about 
you.” 

He bristled. “It’s probably a lie.” 

“Oh, really? You aren’t second in command of the 
pack, then?” 

He blinked, his face going blank with surprise. “Oh. 
That.” 

“How come you never told me that?” 

“Why would I? It’s no big thing.” 

“I don’t know. Why not? It’s interesting. So, how does 
that work? How did Sam end up as the Alpha, and 
you as the ... the Beta?” 

Jacob chuckled at my invented term. “Sam was the 
first, the oldest. It made sense for him to take 
charge.” 

I frowned. “But shouldn’t Jared or Paul be second, 
then? They were the next to change.” 

“Well ... it’s hard to explain,” Jacob said evasively. 

“Try.” 

He sighed. “It’s more about the lineage, you know? 
Sort of old-fashioned. Why should it matter who your 
grandpa was, right?” 



519 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I remembered something Jacob had told me a long 
time ago, before either of us had known anything 
about werewolves. 

“Didn’t you say that Ephraim Black was the last chief 
the Quileutes had?” 

“Yeah, that’s right. Because he was the Alpha. Did 
you know that, technically, Sam’s the chief of the 
whole tribe now?” He laughed. “Crazy traditions.” 

I thought about that for a second, trying to make all 
the pieces fit. “But you also said that people listened 
to your dad more than anyone else on the council, 
because he was Ephraim’s grandson?” 

“What about it?” 

“Well, if it’s about the lineage ... shouldn’t you be the 
chief, then?” 

Jacob didn’t answer me. He stared into the darkening 
forest, as if he suddenly needed to concentrate on 
where he was going. 

“Jake?” 

“No. That’s Sam’s job.” He kept his eyes on our 
pathless course. 

“Why? His great-granddad was Levi Uley, right? Was 
Levi an Alpha, too?” 

“There’s only one Alpha,” he answered automatically. 
“So what was Levi?” 

“Sort of a Beta, I guess.” He snorted at my term. “Like 
me.”

“That doesn’t make sense.” 



“It doesn’t matter.” 

“I just want to understand.” 

Jacob finally met my confused gaze, and then sighed. 
“Yeah. I was supposed to be the Alpha.” 

My eyebrows pulled together. “Sam didn’t want to 
step down?” 

“Hardly. I didn’t want to step up.” 

“Why not?” 

He frowned, uncomfortable with my questions. Well, 
it was his turn to feel uncomfortable. 

“I didn’t want any of it, Bella. I didn’t want anything 
to change. I didn’t want to be some legendary chief. I 
didn’t want to be part of a pack of werewolves, let 
alone their leader. I wouldn’t take it when Sam 
offered.” 

I thought about this for a long moment. Jacob didn’t 
interrupt. He stared into the forest again. 

“But I thought you were happier. That you were okay 
with this,” I finally whispered. 

Jacob smiled down at me reassuringly. “Yeah. It’s 
really not so bad. Exciting sometimes, like with this 
thing tomorrow. But at first it sort of felt like being 
drafted into a war you didn’t know existed. There was 
no choice, you know? And it was so final.” He 
shrugged. “Anyway, I guess I’m glad now. It has to be 
done, and could I trust someone else to get it right? 
It’s better to make sure myself.”

I stared at him, feeling an unexpected kind of awe for 
my friend. He was more of a grown-up than I’d ever 
given him credit for. Like with Billy the other night at 
the bonfire, there was a majesty here that I’d never 
suspected. 

“Chief Jacob,” I whispered, smiling at the way the 
words sounded together. 

He rolled his eyes. 

Just then, the wind shook more fiercely through the 
trees around us, and it felt like it was blowing straight 
off a glacier. The sharp sound of wood cracking 
echoed off the mountain. Though the light was 
vanishing as the grisly cloud covered the sky, I could 
still see the little white specks that fluttered past us. 

Jacob stepped up the pace, keeping his eyes on the 
ground now as he flat out sprinted. I curled more 
willingly against his chest, recoiling from the 
unwelcome snow. 

It was only minutes later that he dashed around to 
the lee side of the stony peak and we could see the 
little tent nestled up against the sheltering face. More 
flurries were falling around us, but the wind was too 
fierce to let them settle anywhere. 

“Bella!” Edward called out in acute relief. We’d caught 
him in the middle of pacing back and forth across the 
little open space. 

He flashed to my side, sort of blurring as he moved so 
swiftly. Jacob cringed, and then set me on my feet. 
Edward ignored his reaction and caught me in a tight 
hug. 



522 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Thank you,” Edward said over my head. His tone was 
unmistakably sincere. “That was quicker than I 
expected, and I truly appreciate it.” 

I twisted to see Jacob’s response. 

Jacob merely shrugged, all the friendliness wiped 
clean from his face. “Get her inside. This is going to 
be bad — my hair’s standing up on my scalp. Is that 
tent secure?” 

“I all but welded it to the rock.” 

“Good.” 

Jacob looked up at the sky — now black with the 
storm, sprinkled with the swirling bits of snow. His 
nostrils flared. 

“I’m going to change,” he said. “I want to know what’s 
going on back home.” 

He hung his jacket on a low, stubby branch, and 
walked into the murky forest without a backward 
glance. 



523 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 





FIRE AND ICE 



The wind shook the tent again, and I shook with it. 

The temperature was dropping. I could feel it through 
the down bag, through my jacket. I was fully dressed, 
my hiking boots still laced into place. It didn’t make 
any difference. How could it be so cold? How could it 
keep getting colder? It had to bottom out sometime, 
didn’t it? 

“W-w-w-w-w-what t-t-t-t-time is it?” I forced the 
words through my rattling teeth. 

“Two,” Edward answered. 

Edward sat as far from me as possible in the cramped 
space, afraid to even breathe on me when I was 
already so cold. It was too dark to see his face, but 
his voice was wild with worry, indecision, and 
frustration. 

“Maybe ...” 

“No, I’m f-f-f-f-f-fine, r-r-r-really. I don’t w-w-w-want 
to g-go outside.” 

He’d tried to talk me into making a run for it a dozen 
times already, but I was terrified of leaving my 
shelter. If it was this cold in here, protected from the 
raging wind, I could imagine how bad it would be if 
we were running through it. 

And it would waste all our efforts this afternoon. 
Would we have enough time to reset ourselves when 
the storm was over? What if it didn’t end? It made no 

524 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



sense to move now. I could shiver my way through 
one night. 

I was worried that the trail I had laid would be lost, 
but he promised that it would still be plain to the 
coming monsters. 

“What can I do?” he almost begged. 

I just shook my head. 

Out in the snow, Jacob whined unhappily. 

“G-g-g-get out of h-h-h-ere,” I ordered, again. 

“He’s just worried about you,” Edward translated. 
“He’s fine. His body is equipped to deal with this.” 

“H-h-h-h-h-h.” I wanted to say that he should still 
leave, but I couldn’t get it past my teeth. I nearly bit 
my tongue off trying. At least Jacob did seem to be 
well equipped for the snow, better even than the 
others in his pack with his thicker, longer, shaggy 
russet fur. I wondered why that was. 

Jacob whimpered, a high-pitched, grating sound of 
complaint. 

“What do you want me to do?” Edward growled, too 
anxious to bother with politeness anymore. “Carry her 
through that? I don’t see you making yourself useful. 
Why don’t you go fetch a space heater or something?” 

“I’m ok-k-k-k-k-k-kay,” I protested. Judging from 
Edward’s groan and the muted growl outside the tent, 
I hadn’t convinced anyone. The wind rocked the tent 
roughly, and I shuddered in harmony with it. 



525 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




A sudden howl ripped through the roar of the wind, 
and I covered my ears against the noise. Edward 
scowled. 

“That was hardly necessary,” he muttered. “And that’s 
the worst idea I’ve ever heard,” he called more loudly. 

“Better than anything you’ve come up with,” Jacob 
answered, his human voice startling me. “Go fetch a 
space heater,” he grumbled. “I’m not a St. Bernard.” 

I heard the sound of the zipper around the tent door 
pulling swiftly down. 

Jacob slid through the smallest opening he could 
manage, while the arctic air flowed in around him, a 
few flecks of snow falling to the floor of the tent. I 
shivered so hard it was a convulsion. 

“I don’t like this,” Edward hissed as Jake zipped the 
tent door shut. “Just give her the coat and get out.” 

My eyes were adjusted enough to see shapes — Jacob 
was carrying the parka that had been hanging on a 
tree next to the tent. 

I tried to ask what they were talking about, but all 
that came out of my mouth was, “W-w-w-w-w-w,” as 
the shivering made me stutter uncontrollably. 

“The parka’s for tomorrow — she’s too cold to warm it 
up by herself. It’s frozen.” He dropped it by the door. 
“You said she needed a space heater, and here I am.” 
Jacob held his arms as wide as the tent allowed. As 
usual, when he’d been running around as a wolf, he’d 
only thrown on the bare essentials — just a pair of 
sweats, no shirt, no shoes. 



526 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“J-J-J-J-Jake, you’ll f-f-f-freez-z-z-ze,” I tried to 
complain. 

“Not me,” he said cheerfully. “I run at a toasty one-oh- 
eight point nine these days. I’ll have you sweating in 
no time.” 

Edward snarled, but Jacob didn’t even look at him. 
Instead, he crawled to my side and started unzipping 
my sleeping bag. 

Edward’s hand was suddenly hard on his shoulder, 
restraining, snow white against the dark skin. Jacob’s 
jaw clenched, his nostrils flaring, his body recoiling 
from the cold touch. The long muscles in his arms 
flexed automatically. 

“Get your hand off of me,” he growled through his 
teeth. 

“Keep your hands off of her,” Edward answered 
blackly. 

“D-d-d-don’t f-f-f-f-fight,” I pleaded. Another tremor 
rocked through me. It felt like my teeth were going to 
shatter, they were slamming together so hard. 

“I’m sure she’ll thank you for this when her toes turn 
black and drop off,” Jacob snapped. 

Edward hesitated, then his hand fell away and he slid 
back to his position in the corner. 

His voice was flat and frightening. “Watch yourself.” 

Jacob chuckled. 

“Scoot over, Bella,” he said, zipping the sleeping bag 
open farther. 

527 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I stared at him in outrage. No wonder Edward was 
reacting this way. 

“N-n-n-n-n,” I tried to protest. 

“Don’t be stupid,” he said, exasperated. “Don’t you 
like having ten toes?” 

He crammed his body into the nonexistent space, 
forcing the zipper up behind himself. 

And then I couldn’t object — I didn’t want to 
anymore. He was so warm. His arms constricted 
around me, holding me snugly against his bare chest. 
The heat was irresistible, like air after being 
underwater for too long. He cringed when I pressed 
my icy fingers eagerly against his skin. 

“Jeez, you’re freezing, Bella,” he complained. 

“S-s-s-s-sorry,” I stuttered. 

“Try to relax,” he suggested as another shiver rippled 
through me violently. “You’ll be warm in a minute. Of 
course, you’d warm up faster if you took your clothes 
off.” 

Edward growled sharply. 

“That’s just a simple fact,” Jacob defended himself. 
“Survival one-oh-one.” 

“C-c-cut it out, Jake,” I said angrily, though my body 
refused to even try to pull away from him. “N-n-n- 
nobody really n-n-n-n-needs all ten t-t-t-toes.” 

“Don’t worry about the bloodsucker,” Jacob 
suggested, and his tone was smug. “He’s just 
jealous.” 

528 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Of course I am.” Edward’s voice was velvet again, 
under control, a musical murmur in the darkness. 
“You don’t have the faintest idea how much I wish I 
could do what you’re doing for her, mongrel.” 

“Those are the breaks,” Jacob said lightly, but then 
his tone soured. “At least you know she wishes it was 
you.” 

“True,” Edward agreed. 

The shuddering slowed, became bearable while they 
wrangled. 

“There,” Jacob said, pleased. “Feeling better?” 

I was finally able to speak clearly. “Yes.” 

“Your lips are still blue,” he mused. “Want me to 
warm those up for you, too? You only have to ask.” 

Edward sighed heavily. 

“Behave yourself,” I muttered, pressing my face 
against his shoulder. He flinched again when my cold 
skin touched his, and I smiled with slightly vindictive 
satisfaction. 

It was already warm and snug inside the sleeping 
bag. Jacob’s body heat seemed to radiate from every 
side — maybe because there was so much of him. I 
kicked my boots off, and pushed my toes against his 
legs. He jumped slightly, and then leaned his head 
down to press his hot cheek against my numb ear. 

I noticed that Jacob’s skin had a woodsy, musky 
scent — it fit the setting, here in the middle of the 
forest. It was nice. I wondered if the Cullens and the 
Quileutes weren’t just playing up that whole odor 

529 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




issue because of their prejudices. Everyone smelled 
fine to me. 

The storm howled like an animal attacking the tent, 
but it didn’t worry me now. Jacob was out of the cold, 
and so was I. Plus, I was simply too exhausted to 
worry about anything — tired from just staying awake 
so late, and aching from the muscle spasms. My body 
relaxed slowly as I thawed, piece by frozen piece, and 
then turned limp. 

“Jake?” I mumbled sleepily. “Can I ask you 
something? I’m not trying to be a jerk or anything, I’m 
honestly curious.” They were the same words he’d 
used in my kitchen . . . how long ago was it now? 

“Sure,” he chuckled, remembering. 

“Why are you so much furrier than your friends? You 
don’t have to answer if I’m being rude.” I didn’t know 
the rules for etiquette as they applied to werewolf 
culture. 

“Because my hair is longer,” he said, amused — my 
question hadn’t offended him, at least. He shook his 
head so that his unkempt hair — grown out to his 
chin now — tickled my cheek. 

“Oh.” I was surprised, but it made sense. So that was 
why they’d all cropped their hair in the beginning, 
when they joined the pack. “Then why don’t you cut 
it? Do you like to be shaggy?” 

He didn’t answer right away this time, and Edward 
laughed under his breath. 

“Sorry,” I said, pausing to yawn. “I didn’t mean to pry. 
You don’t have to tell me.” 



530 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jacob made an annoyed sound. “Oh, he’ll tell you 
anyway, so I might as well... . I was growing my hair 
out because ... it seemed like you liked it better long.” 

“Oh.” I felt awkward. “I, er, like it both ways, Jake. 

You don’t need to be ... inconvenienced.” 

He shrugged. “Turns out it was very convenient 
tonight, so don’t worry about it.” 

I didn’t have anything else to say. As the silence 
lengthened, my eyelids drooped and shut, and my 
breathing grew slower, more even. 

“That’s right, honey, go to sleep,” Jacob whispered. 

I sighed, content, already half-unconscious. 

“Seth is here,” Edward muttered to Jacob, and I 
suddenly understood the point of the howling. 

“Perfect. Now you can keep an eye on everything else, 
while I take care of your girlfriend for you.” 

Edward didn’t answer, but I groaned groggily. “Stop 
it,” I muttered. 

It was quiet then, inside at least. Outside, the wind 
shrieked insanely through the trees. The shimmying 
of the tent made it hard to sleep. The poles would 
suddenly jerk and quiver, pulling me back from the 
edge of unconsciousness each time I was close to 
slipping under. I felt so bad for the wolf, the boy that 
was stuck outside in the snow. 

My mind wandered as I waited for sleep to find me. 
This warm little space made me think of the early 
days with Jacob, and I remembered how it used to be 
when he was my replacement sun, the warmth that 

531 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




made my empty life livable. It had been a while since 
I’d thought of Jake that way, but here he was, 
warming me again. 

“Please!” Edward hissed. “Do you mind!” 

“What?” Jacob whispered back, his tone surprised. 

“Do you think you could attempt to control your 
thoughts?” Edward’s low whisper was furious. 

“No one said you had to listen,” Jacob muttered, 
defiant, yet still embarrassed. “Get out of my head.” 

“I wish I could. You have no idea how loud your little 
fantasies are. It’s like you’re shouting them at me.” 

“I’ll try to keep it down,” Jacob whispered 
sarcastically. 

There was a brief moment of silence. 

“Yes,” Edward answered an unspoken thought in a 
murmur so low I barely made it out. “I’m jealous of 
that, too.” 

“I figured it was like that,” Jacob whispered smugly. 
“Sort of evens the playing field up a little, doesn’t it?” 

Edward chuckled. “In your dreams.” 

“You know, she could still change her mind,” Jacob 
taunted him. “Considering all the things I could do 
with her that you can’t. At least, not without killing 
her, that is.” 

“Go to sleep, Jacob,” Edward murmured. “You’re 
starting to get on my nerves.” 



532 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I think I will. I’m really very comfortable.” 
Edward didn’t answer. 



I was too far gone to ask them to stop talking about 
me like I wasn’t there. The conversation had taken on 
a dreamlike quality to me, and I wasn’t sure I was 
really awake. 

“Maybe I would,” Edward said after a moment, 
answering a question I hadn’t heard. 

“But would you be honest?” 

“You can always ask and see.” Edward’s tone made 
me wonder if I was missing out on a joke. 

“Well, you see inside my head — let me see inside 
yours tonight, it’s only fair,” Jacob said. 

“Your head is full of questions. Which one do you 
want me to answer?” 

“The jealousy ... it has to be eating at you. You can’t 
be as sure of yourself as you seem. Unless you have 
no emotions at all.” 

“Of course it is,” Edward agreed, no longer amused. 
“Right now it’s so bad that I can barely control my 
voice. Of course, it’s even worse when she’s away from 
me, with you, and I can’t see her.” 

“Do you think about it all the time?” Jacob whispered. 
“Does it make it hard to concentrate when she’s not 
with you?” 

“Yes and no,” Edward said; he seemed determined to 
answer honestly. “My mind doesn’t work quite the 
same as yours. I can think of many more things at 

533 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




one time. Of course, that means that I’m always able 
to think of you, always able to wonder if that’s where 
her mind is, when she’s quiet and thoughtful.” 

They were both still for a minute. 

“Yes, I would guess that she thinks about you often,” 
Edward murmured in response to Jacob’s thoughts. 
“More often than I like. She worries that you’re 
unhappy. Not that you don’t know that. Not that you 
don’t use that.” 

“I have to use whatever I can,” Jacob muttered. “I’m 
not working with your advantages — advantages like 
her knowing she’s in love with you.” 

“That helps,” Edward agreed in a mild tone. 

Jacob was defiant. “She’s in love with me, too, you 
know.” 

Edward didn’t answer. 

Jacob sighed. “But she doesn’t know it.” 

“I can’t tell you if you’re right.” 

“Does that bother you? Do you wish you could see 
what she’s thinking, too?” 

“Yes ... and no, again. She likes it better this way, 
and, though it sometimes drives me insane, I’d rather 
she was happy.” 

The wind ripped around the tent, shaking it like an 
earthquake. Jacob’s arms tightened around me 
protectively. 



534 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Thank you,” Edward whispered. “Odd as this might 
sound, I suppose I’m glad you’re here, Jacob.” 

“You mean, ‘as much as I’d love to kill you, I’m glad 
she’s warm,’ right?” 

“It’s an uncomfortable truce, isn’t it?” 

Jacob’s whisper was suddenly smug. “I knew you 
were just as crazy jealous as I am.” 

“I’m not such a fool as to wear it on my sleeve like you 
do. It doesn’t help your case, you know.” 

“You have more patience than I do.” 

“I should. I’ve had a hundred years to gain it. A 
hundred years of waiting for her.” 

“So ... at what point did you decide to play the very 
patient good guy?” 

“When I saw how much it was hurting her to make 
her choose. It’s not usually this difficult to control. I 
can smother the . . . less civilized feelings I may have 
for you fairly easily most of the time. Sometimes I 
think she sees through me, but I can’t be sure.” 

“I think you were just worried that if you really forced 
her to choose, she might not choose you.” 

Edward didn’t answer right away. “That was a part of 
it,” he finally admitted. “But only a small part. We all 
have our moments of doubt. Mostly I was worried that 
she’d hurt herself trying to sneak away to see you. 
After I’d accepted that she was more or less safe with 
you — as safe as Bella ever is — it seemed best to 
stop driving her to extremes.” 



535 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jacob sighed. “I’d tell her all of this, but she’d never 
believe me.” 

“I know.” It sounded like Edward was smiling. 

“You think you know everything,” Jacob muttered. 

“I don’t know the future,” Edward said, his voice 
suddenly unsure. 

There was a long pause. 

“What would you do if she changed her mind?” Jacob 
asked. 

“I don’t know that either.” 

Jacob chuckled quietly. “Would you try to kill me?” 
Sarcastic again, as if doubting Edward’s ability to do 
it. 

“No.” 

“Why not?” Jacob’s tone was still jeering. 

“Do you really think I would hurt her that way?” 

Jacob hesitated for a second, and then sighed. “Yeah, 
you’re right. I know that’s right. But sometimes ...” 

“Sometimes it’s an intriguing idea.” 

Jacob pressed his face into the sleeping bag to muffle 
his laugher. “Exactly,” he eventually agreed. 

What a strange dream this was. I wondered if it was 
the relentless wind that made me imagine all the 
whispering. Only the wind was screaming rather than 
whispering ... 

536 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“What is it like? Losing her?” Jacob asked after a 
quiet moment, and there was no hint of humor in his 
suddenly hoarse voice. “When you thought that you’d 
lost her forever? How did you . . . cope?” 

“That’s very difficult for me to talk about.” 

Jacob waited. 

“There were two different times that I thought that.” 
Edward spoke each word just a little slower than 
normal. “The first time, when I thought I could leave 
her ... that was ... almost bearable. Because I thought 
she would forget me and it would be like I hadn’t 
touched her life. For over six months I was able to 
stay away, to keep my promise that I wouldn’t 
interfere again. It was getting close — I was fighting 
but I knew I wasn’t going to win; I would have come 
back ... just to check on her. That’s what I would 
have told myself, anyway. And if I’d found her 
reasonably happy ... I like to think that I could have 
gone away again. 

“But she wasn’t happy. And I would have stayed. 
That’s how she convinced me to stay with her 
tomorrow, of course. You were wondering about that 
before, what could possibly motivate me ... what she 
was feeling so needlessly guilty about. She reminded 
me of what it did to her when I left — what it still 
does to her when I leave. She feels horrible about 
bringing that up, but she’s right. I’ll never be able to 
make up for that, but I’ll never stop trying anyway.” 

Jacob didn’t respond for a moment, listening to the 
storm or digesting what he’d heard, I didn’t know 
which. 

“And the other time — when you thought she was 
dead?” Jacob whispered roughly. 

537 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Yes.” Edward answered a different question. “It will 
probably feel like that to you, won’t it? The way you 
perceive us, you might not be able to see her as Bella 
anymore. But that’s who she’ll be.” 

“That’s not what I asked.” 

Edward’s voice came back fast and hard. “I can’t tell 
you how it felt. There aren’t words.” 

Jacob’s arms flexed around me. 

“But you left because you didn’t want to make her a 
bloodsucker. You want her to be human.” 

Edward spoke slowly. “Jacob, from the second that I 
realized that I loved her, I knew there were only four 
possibilities. The first alternative, the best one for 
Bella, would be if she didn’t feel as strongly for me — 
if she got over me and moved on. I would accept that, 
though it would never change the way I felt. You 
think of me as a ... living stone — hard and cold. 
That’s true. We are set the way we are, and it is very 
rare for us to experience a real change. When that 
happens, as when Bella entered my life, it is a 
permanent change. There’s no going back... . 

“The second alternative, the one I’d originally chosen, 
was to stay with her throughout her human life. It 
wasn’t a good option for her, to waste her life with 
someone who couldn’t be human with her, but it was 
the alternative I could most easily face. Knowing all 
along that, when she died, I would find a way to die, 
too. Sixty years, seventy years — it would seem like a 
very, very short time to me... . But then it proved 
much too dangerous for her to live in such close 
proximity with my world. It seemed like everything 
that could go wrong did. Or hung over us ... waiting 



538 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




to go wrong. I was terrified that I wouldn’t get those 
sixty years if I stayed near her while she was human. 



“So I chose option three. Which turned out to be the 
worst mistake of my very long life, as you know. I 
chose to take myself out of her world, hoping to force 
her into the first alternative. It didn’t work, and it very 
nearly killed us both. 

“What do I have left but the fourth option? It’s what 
she wants — at least, she thinks she does. I’ve been 
trying to delay her, to give her time to find a reason to 
change her mind, but she’s very ... stubborn. You 
know that. I’ll be lucky to stretch this out a few more 
months. She has a horror of getting older, and her 
birthday is in September... .” 

“I like option one,” Jacob muttered. 

Edward didn’t respond. 

“You know exactly how much I hate to accept this,” 
Jacob whispered slowly, “but I can see that you do 
love her ... in your way. I can’t argue with that 
anymore. 

“Given that, I don’t think you should give up on the 
first alternative, not yet. I think there’s a very good 
chance that she would be okay. After time. You know, 
if she hadn’t jumped off a cliff in March ... and if 
you’d waited another six months to check on her... . 
Well, you might have found her reasonably happy. I 
had a game plan.” 

Edward chuckled. “Maybe it would have worked. It 
was a well thought-out plan.” 

“Yeah.” Jake sighed. “But ... ,” suddenly he was 
whispering so fast the words got tangled, “give me a 

539 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




year, bl — Edward. I really think I could make her 
happy. She’s stubborn, no one knows that better than 
I do, but she’s capable of healing. She would have 
healed before. And she could be human, with Charlie 
and Renee, and she could grow up, and have kids and 
...be Bella. 

“You love her enough that you have to see the 
advantages of that plan. She thinks you’re very 
unselfish . . . are you really? Can you consider the idea 
that I might be better for her than you are?” 

“I have considered it,” Edward answered quietly. “In 
some ways, you would be better suited for her than 
another human. Bella takes some looking after, and 
you’re strong enough that you could protect her from 
herself, and from everything that conspires against 
her. You have done that already, and I’ll owe you for 
that for as long as I live — forever — whichever comes 
first... . 

“I even asked Alice if she could see that — see if Bella 
would be better off with you. She couldn’t, of course. 
She can’t see you, and then Bella’s sure of her course, 
for now. 

“But I’m not stupid enough to make the same mistake 
I made before, Jacob. I won’t try to force her into that 
first option again. As long as she wants me, I’m here.” 

“And if she were to decide that she wanted me?” 

Jacob challenged. “Okay, it’s a long shot, I’ll give you 
that.” 

“I would let her go.” 

“Just like that?” 



540 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“In the sense that I’d never show her how hard it was 
for me, yes. But I would keep watch. You see, Jacob, 
you might leave her someday. Like Sam and Emily, 
you wouldn’t have a choice. I would always be waiting 
in the wings, hoping for that to happen.” 

Jacob snorted quietly. “Well, you’ve been much more 
honest than I had any right to expect ... Edward. 
Thanks for letting me in your head.” 

“As I said, I’m feeling oddly grateful for your presence 
in her life tonight. It was the least I could do... . You 
know, Jacob, if it weren’t for the fact that we’re 
natural enemies and that you’re also trying to steal 
away the reason for my existence, I might actually 
like you.” 

“Maybe ... if you weren’t a disgusting vampire who 
was planning to suck out the life of the girl I love . . . 
well, no, not even then.” 

Edward chuckled. 

“Can I ask you something?” Edward said after a 
moment. 

“Why would you have to ask?” 

“I can only hear if you think of it. It’s just a story that 
Bella seemed reluctant to tell me about the other day. 
Something about a third wife ... ?” 

“What about it?” 

Edward didn’t answer, listening to the story in 
Jacob’s head. I heard his low hiss in the darkness. 

“What?” Jacob demanded again. 



541 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Of course,” Edward seethed. “Of course! I rather wish 
your elders had kept that story to themselves, Jacob.” 

“You don’t like the leeches being painted as the bad 
guys?” Jacob mocked. “You know, they are. Then and 
now.” 

“I really couldn’t care less about that part. Can’t you 
guess which character Bella would identify with?” 

It took Jacob a minute. “Oh. Ugh. The third wife. 

Okay, I see your point.” 

“She wants to be there in the clearing. To do what 
little she can, as she puts it.” He sighed. “That was 
the secondary reason for my staying with her 
tomorrow. She’s quite inventive when she wants 
something.” 

“You know, your military brother gave her the idea 
just as much as the story did.” 

“Neither side meant any harm,” Edward whispered, 
peace-making now. 

“And when does this little truce end?” Jacob asked. 
“First light? Or do we wait until after the fight?” 

There was a pause as they both considered. 

“First light,” they whispered together, and then 
laughed quietly. 

“Sleep well, Jacob,” Edward murmured. “Enjoy the 
moment.” 

It was quiet again, and the tent held still for a few 
minutes. The wind seemed to have decided that it 



542 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




wasn’t going to flatten us after all, and was giving up 
the fight. 

Edward groaned softly. “I didn’t mean that quite so 
literally.” 

“Sorry,” Jacob whispered. “You could leave, you know 
— give us a little privacy.” 

“Would you like me to help you sleep, Jacob?” 

Edward offered. 

“You could try,” Jacob said, unconcerned. “It would 
be interesting to see who walked away, wouldn’t it?” 

“Don’t tempt me too far, wolf. My patience isn’t that 
perfect.” 

Jacob whispered a laugh. “I’d rather not move just 
now, if you don’t mind.” 

Edward started humming to himself, louder than 
usual — trying to drown out Jacob’s thoughts, I 
assumed. But it was my lullaby he hummed, and, 
despite my growing discomfort with this whispered 
dream, I sank deeper into unconsciousness ... into 
other dreams that made better sense... . 



543 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 





When I woke up in the morning, it was very bright — 
even inside the tent, the sunlight hurt my eyes. And I 
was sweating, as Jacob had predicted. Jacob was 
snoring lightly in my ear, his arms still wrapped 
around me. 

I pulled my head away from his feverishly warm chest 
and felt the sting of the cold morning on my clammy 
cheek. Jacob sighed in his sleep; his arms tightened 
unconsciously. 

I squirmed, unable to loosen his hold, struggling to 
lift my head enough to see... . 

Edward met my gaze evenly. His expression was calm, 
but the pain in his eyes was unconcealed. 

“Is it any warmer out there?” I whispered. 

“Yes. I don’t think the space heater will be necessary 
today.” 

I tried to get to the zipper, but I couldn’t free my 
arms. I strained, fighting against Jacob’s inert 
strength. Jacob muttered, still fast asleep, his arms 
constricting again. 

“Some help?” I asked quietly. 

Edward smiled. “Did you want me to take his arms all 
the way off?” 

“No, thank you. Just get me free. I’m going to get heat 
stroke.” 

544 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



Edward unzipped the sleeping bag in a swift, abrupt 
movement. Jacob fell out, his bare back hitting the 
icy floor of the tent. 

“Hey!” he complained, his eyes flying open. 
Instinctively, he flinched away from the cold, rolling 
onto me. I gasped as his weight knocked the breath 
out of me. 

And then his weight was gone. I felt the impact as 
Jacob flew into one of the tent poles and the tent 
shuddered. 

The growling erupted from all around. Edward was 
crouching in front of me, and I couldn’t see his face, 
but the snarls were ripping angrily out of his chest. 
Jacob was half-crouched, too, his whole body 
quivering, while growls rumbled through his clenched 
teeth. Outside the tent, Seth Clearwater’s vicious 
snarls echoed off the rocks. 

“Stop it, stop it!” I yelled, scrambling awkwardly to 
put myself between them. The space was so small 
that I didn’t have to stretch far to put one hand on 
each of their chests. Edward wrapped his hand 
around my waist, ready to yank me out of the way. 

“Stop it, now,” I warned him. 

Under my touch, Jacob began to calm himself. The 
shaking slowed, but his teeth were still bared, his 
eyes furiously focused on Edward. Seth continued to 
growl, a long unbroken sound, a violent background 
to the sudden silence in the tent. 

“Jacob?” I asked, waiting until he finally dropped his 
glare to look at me. “Are you hurt?” 

“Of course not!” he hissed. 

545 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I turned to Edward. He was looking at me, his 
expression hard and angry. “That wasn’t nice. You 
should say sorry.” 

His eyes widened in disgust. “You must be joking — 
he was crushing you!” 

“Because you dumped him on the floor! He didn’t do 
it on purpose, and he didn’t hurt me.” 

Edward groaned, revolted. Slowly, he looked up to 
glare at Jacob with hostile eyes. “My apologies, dog.” 

“No harm done,” Jacob said, a taunting edge to his 
voice. 

It was still cold, though not as cold as it had been. I 
curled my arms around my chest. 

“Here,” Edward said, calm again. He took the parka 
off the floor and wrapped it over the top of my coat. 

“That’s Jacob’s,” I objected. 

“Jacob has a fur coat,” Edward hinted. 

“I’ll just use the sleeping bag again, if you don’t 
mind.” Jacob ignored him, climbing around us and 
sliding into the down bag. “I wasn’t quite ready to 
wake up. That wasn’t the best night’s sleep I ever 
had.” 

“It was your idea,” Edward said impassively. 

Jacob was curled up, his eyes already closed. He 
yawned. “I didn’t say it wasn’t the best night I’ve ever 
spent. Just that I didn’t get a lot of sleep. I thought 
Bella was never going to shut up.” 



546 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I winced, wondering what might have come out of my 
mouth in my sleep. The possibilities were horrifying. 



“I’m glad you enjoyed yourself,” Edward murmured. 

Jacob’s dark eyes fluttered open. “Didn’t you have a 
nice night, then?” he asked, smug. 

“It wasn’t the worst night of my life.” 

“Did it make the top ten?” Jacob asked with perverse 
enjoyment. 

“Possibly.” 

Jacob smiled and closed his eyes. 

“But,” Edward went on, “if I had been able to take 
your place last night, it would not have made the top 
ten of the best nights of my life. Dream about that.” 

Jacob’s eyes opened into a glare. He sat up stiffly, his 
shoulders tense. 

“You know what? I think it’s too crowded in here.” 

“I couldn’t agree more.” 

I elbowed Edward in the ribs — probably giving 
myself a bruise. 

“Guess I’ll catch up on my sleep later, then.” Jacob 
made a face. “I need to talk to Sam anyway.” 

He rolled to his knees and grabbed the door’s zipper. 

Pain crackled down my spine and lodged in my 
stomach as I abruptly realized that this could be the 
last time I would see him. He was going back to Sam, 

547 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




back to fight the horde of bloodthirsty newborn 
vampires. 

“Jake, wait — ” I reached after him, my hand sliding 
down his arm. 

He jerked his arm away before my fingers could find 
purchase. 

“Please, Jake? Won’t you stay?” 

“No.” 

The word was hard and cold. I knew my face gave 
away my pain, because he exhaled and half a smile 
softened his expression. 

“Don’t worry about me, Bells. I’ll be fine, just like I 
always am.” He forced a laugh. “’Sides, you think I’m 
going to let Seth go in my place — have all the fun 
and steal all the glory? Right.” He snorted. 

“Be careful — ” 

He shoved out of the tent before I could finish. 

“Give it a rest, Bella,” I heard him mutter as he re- 
zipped the door. 

I listened for the sound of his retreating footsteps, but 
it was perfectly still. No more wind. I could hear 
morning birdsong far away on the mountain, and 
nothing else. Jacob moved in silence now. 

I huddled in my coats, and leaned against Edward’s 
shoulder. We were quiet for a long time. 

“How much longer?” I asked. 



548 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Alice told Sam it should be an hour or so,” Edward 
said, soft and bleak. 

“We stay together. No matter what.” 

“No matter what,” he agreed, his eyes tight. 

“I know,” I said. “I’m terrified for them, too.” 

“They know how to handle themselves,” Edward 
assured me, purposely making his voice light. “I just 
hate missing the fun.” 

Again with the fun. My nostrils flared. 

He put his arm around my shoulder. “Don’t worry,” 
he urged, and then he kissed my forehead. 

As if there was any way to avoid that. “Sure, sure.” 

“Do you want me to distract you?” He breathed, 
running his cold fingers along my cheekbone. 

I shivered involuntarily; the morning was still frosty. 

“Maybe not right now,” he answered himself, pulling 
his hand away. 

“There are other ways to distract me.” 

“What would you like?” 

“You could tell me about your ten best nights,” I 
suggested. “I’m curious.” 

He laughed. “Try to guess.” 

I shook my head. “There ’re too many nights I don’t 
know about. A century of them.” 

549 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I’ll narrow it down for you. All of my best nights have 
happened since I met you.” 



“Really?” 

“Yes, really — and by quite a wide margin, too.” 

I thought for a minute. “I can only think of mine,” I 
admitted. 

“They might be the same,” he encouraged. 

“Well, there was the first night. The night you stayed.” 

“Yes, that’s one of mine, too. Of course, you were 
unconscious for my favorite part.” 

“That’s right,” I remembered. “I was talking that 
night, too.” 

“Yes,” he agreed. 

My face got hot as I wondered again what I might 
have said while sleeping in Jacob’s arms. I couldn’t 
remember what I’d dreamed about, or if I’d dreamed 
at all, so that was no help. 

“What did I say last night?” I whispered more quietly 
than before. 

He shrugged instead of answering, and I winced. 

“That bad?” 

“Nothing too horrible,” he sighed. 

“Please tell me.” 

“Mostly you said my name, the same as usual.” 

550 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“That’s not bad,” I agreed cautiously. 

“Near the end, though, you started mumbling some 
nonsense about ‘Jacob, my Jacob.’” I could hear the 
pain, even in the whisper. “Your Jacob enjoyed that 
quite a lot.” 

I stretched my neck up, straining to reach my lips to 
the edge of his jaw. I couldn’t see into his eyes. He 
was staring up at the ceiling of the tent. 

“Sorry,” I murmured. “That’s just the way I 
differentiate.” 

“Differentiate?” 

“Between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Between the Jacob 
I like and the one who annoys the hell out of me,” I 
explained. 

“That makes sense.” He sounded slightly mollified. 
“Tell me another favorite night.” 

“Flying home from Italy.” 

He frowned. 

“Is that not one of yours?” I wondered. 

“No, it is one of mine, actually, but I’m surprised it’s 
on your list. Weren’t you under the ludicrous 
impression I was just acting from a guilty conscience, 
and I was going to bolt as soon as the plane doors 
opened?” 

“Yes.” I smiled. “But, still, you were there.” 

He kissed my hair. “You love me more than I deserve.” 



551 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I laughed at the impossibility of that idea. “Next 
would be the night after Italy,” I continued. 

“Yes, that’s on the list. You were so funny.” 

“Funny?” I objected. 

“I had no idea your dreams were so vivid. It took me 
forever to convince you that you were awake.” 

“I’m still not sure,” I muttered. “You’ve always seemed 
more like a dream than reality. Tell me one of yours, 
now. Did I guess your first place?” 

“No — that would be two nights ago, when you finally 
agreed to marry me.” 

I made a face. 

“That doesn’t make your list?” 

I thought about the way he’d kissed me, the 
concession I’d gained, and changed my mind. “Yes ... 
it does. But with reservations. I don’t understand why 
it’s so important to you. You already had me forever.” 

“A hundred years from now, when you’ve gained 
enough perspective to really appreciate the answer, I 
will explain it to you.” 

“I’ll remind you to explain — in a hundred years.” 

“Are you warm enough?” he asked suddenly. 

“I’m fine,” I assured him. “Why?” 

Before he could answer, the silence outside the tent 
was ripped apart by an earsplitting howl of pain. The 
sound ricocheted off the bare rock face of the 

552 I P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




mountain and filled the air so that it seared from 
every direction. 



The howl tore through my mind like a tornado, both 
strange and familiar. Strange because I’d never heard 
such a tortured cry before. Familiar because I knew 
the voice at once — I recognized the sound and 
understood the meaning as perfectly as if I’d uttered 
it myself. It made no difference that Jacob was not 
human when he cried out. I needed no translation. 

Jacob was close. Jacob had heard every word we’d 
said. Jacob was in agony. 

The howl choked off into a peculiar gurgled sob, and 
then it was quiet again. 

I did not hear his silent escape, but I could feel it — I 
could feel the absence I had wrongly assumed before, 
the empty space he left behind. 

“Because your space heater has reached his limit,” 
Edward answered quietly. “Truce over,” he added, so 
low I couldn’t be sure that was really what he’d said. 

“Jacob was listening,” I whispered. It wasn’t a 
question. 

“Yes.” 

“You knew.” 

“Yes.” 

I stared at nothing, seeing nothing. 

“I never promised to fight fair,” he reminded me 
quietly. “And he deserves to know.” 



553 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




My head fell into my hands. 

“Are you angry with me?” he asked. 

“Not you,” I whispered. “I’m horrified at me.” 

“Don’t torment yourself,” he pleaded. 

“Yes,” I agreed bitterly. “I should save my energy to 
torment Jacob some more. I wouldn’t want to leave 
any part of him unharmed.” 

“He knew what he was doing.” 

“Do you think that matters?” I was blinking back 
tears, and this was easy to hear in my voice. “Do you 
think I care whether it’s fair or whether he was 
adequately warned? I’m hurting him. Every time I 
turn around, I’m hurting him again.” My voice was 
getting louder, more hysterical. “I’m a hideous 
person.” 

He wrapped his arms tightly around me. “No, you’re 
not.” 

“I am! What’s wrong with me?” I struggled against his 
arms, and he let them drop. “I have to go find him.” 

“Bella, he’s already miles away, and it’s cold.” 

“I don’t care. I can’t just sit here.” I shrugged off 
Jacob’s parka, shoved my feet into my boots, and 
crawled stiffly to the door; my legs felt numb. “I have 
to — I have to ...” I didn’t know how to finish the 
sentence, didn’t know what there was to do, but I 
unzipped the door anyway, and climbed out into the 
bright, icy morning. 



554 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




There was less snow than I would have thought after 
the fury of last night’s storm. Probably it had blown 
away rather than melted in the sun that now shone 
low in the southeast, glancing off the snow that 
lingered and stabbing at my unadjusted eyes. The air 
still had a bite to it, but it was dead calm and slowly 
becoming more seasonable as the sun rose higher. 

Seth Clearwater was curled up on a patch of dry pine 
needles in the shadow of a thick spruce, his head on 
his paws. His sand-colored fur was almost invisible 
against the dead needles, but I could see the bright 
snow reflect off his open eyes. He was staring at me 
with what I imagined was an accusation. 

I knew Edward was following me as I stumbled 
toward the trees. I couldn’t hear him, but the sun 
reflected off his skin in glittering rainbows that 
danced ahead of me. He didn’t reach out to stop me 
until I was several paces into the forest shadows. 

His hand caught my left wrist. He ignored it when I 
tried to yank myself free. 

“You can’t go after him. Not today. It’s almost time. 
And getting yourself lost wouldn’t help anyone, 
regardless.” 

I twisted my wrist, pulling uselessly. 

“I’m sorry, Bella,” he whispered. “I’m sorry I did that.” 

“You didn’t do anything. It’s my fault. I did this. I did 
everything wrong. I could have . . . When he ... I 
shouldn’t have ... I ... I ...” I was sobbing. 

“Bella, Bella.” 



555 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




His arms folded around me, and my tears soaked into 
his shirt. 



“I should have — told him — I should — have said — ” 
What? What could have made this right? “He 
shouldn’t have — found out like this.” 

“Do you want me to see if I can bring him back, so 
that you can talk to him? There’s still a little time,” 
Edward murmured, hushed agony in his voice. 

I nodded into his chest, afraid to see his face. 

“Stay by the tent. I’ll be back soon.” 

His arms disappeared. He left so quickly that, in the 
second it took me to look up, he was already gone. I 
was alone. 

A new sob broke from my chest. I was hurting 
everyone today. Was there anything I touched that 
didn’t get spoiled? 

I didn’t know why it was hitting me so hard now. It 
wasn’t like I hadn’t known this was coming all along. 
But Jacob had never reacted so strongly — lost his 
bold overconfidence and shown the intensity of his 
pain. The sound of his agony still cut at me, 
somewhere deep in my chest. Right beside it was the 
other pain. Pain for feeling pain over Jacob. Pain for 
hurting Edward, too. For not being able to watch 
Jacob go with composure, knowing that it was the 
right thing, the only way. 

I was selfish, I was hurtful. I tortured the ones I loved. 

I was like Cathy, like Wuthering Heights, only my 
options were so much better than hers, neither one 
evil, neither one weak. And here I sat, crying about it, 

556 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




not doing anything productive to make it right. Just 
like Cathy. 

I couldn’t allow what hurt me to influence my 
decisions anymore. It was too little, much too late, 
but I had to do what was right now. Maybe it was 
already done for me. Maybe Edward would not be able 
to bring him back. And then I would accept that and 
get on with my life. Edward would never see me shed 
another tear for Jacob Black. There would be no more 
tears. I wiped the last of them away with cold fingers 
now. 

But if Edward did return with Jacob, that was it. I 
had to tell him to go away and never come back. 

Why was that so hard? So very much more difficult 
than saying goodbye to my other friends, to Angela, to 
Mike? Why did that hurt? It wasn’t right. That 
shouldn’t be able to hurt me. I had what I wanted. I 
couldn’t have them both, because Jacob could not be 
just my friend. It was time to give up wishing for that. 
How ridiculously greedy could any one person be? 

I had to get over this irrational feeling that Jacob 
belonged in my life. He couldn’t belong with me, could 
not be my Jacob, when I belonged to someone else. 

I walked slowly back to the little clearing, my feet 
dragging. When I broke into the open space, blinking 
against the sharp light, I threw one quick glance 
toward Seth — he hadn’t moved from his bed of pine 
needles — and then looked away, avoiding his eyes. 

I could feel that my hair was wild, twisted into clumps 
like Medusa’s snakes. I yanked through it with my 
fingers, and then gave up quickly. Who cared what I 
looked like, anyway? 



557 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I grabbed the canteen hanging beside the tent door 
and shook it. It sloshed wetly, so I unscrewed the lid 
and took a swig to rinse my mouth with the ice water. 
There was food somewhere nearby, but I didn’t feel 
hungry enough to look for it. I started pacing across 
the bright little space, feeling Seth’s eyes on me the 
whole time. Because I wouldn’t look at him, in my 
head he became the boy again, rather than the 
gigantic wolf. So much like a younger Jacob. 

I wanted to ask Seth to bark or give some other sign if 
Jacob was coming back, but I stopped myself. It 
didn’t matter if Jacob came back. It might be easier if 
he didn’t. I wished I had some way to call Edward. 

Seth whined at that moment, and got to his feet. 

“What is it?” I asked him stupidly. 

He ignored me, trotting to the edge of the trees, and 
pointing his nose toward the west. He began 
whimpering. 

“Is it the others, Seth?” I demanded. “In the clearing?” 

He looked at me and yelped softly once, and then 
turned his nose alertly back to the west. His ears laid 
back and he whined again. 

Why was I such a fool? What was I thinking, sending 
Edward away? How was I supposed to know what was 
going on? I didn’t speak wolf. 

A cold trickle of fear began to ooze down my spine. 
What if the time had run out? What if Jacob and 
Edward got too close? What if Edward decided to join 
in the fight? 



558 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




The icy fear pooled in my stomach. What if Seth’s 
distress had nothing to do with the clearing, and his 
yelp had been a denial? What if Jacob and Edward 
were fighting with each other, far away somewhere in 
the forest? They wouldn’t do that, would they? 

With sudden, chilling certainty I realized that they 
would — if the wrong words were said. I thought of 
the tense standoff in the tent this morning, and I 
wondered if I’d underestimated how close it had come 
to a fight. 

It would be no more than I deserved if I somehow lost 
them both. 

The ice locked around my heart. 

Before I could collapse with fear, Seth grumbled 
slightly, deep in his chest, and then turned away from 
his watch and sauntered back toward his resting 
place. It calmed me, but irritated me. Couldn’t he 
scratch a message in the dirt or something? 

The pacing was starting to make me sweat under all 
my layers. I threw my jacket into the tent, and then I 
went back to wearing a path across the center of the 
tiny break in the trees. 

Seth jumped to his feet again suddenly, the hackles 
on the back of his neck standing up stiffly. I looked 
around, but saw nothing. If Seth didn’t cut it out, I 
was going to throw a pinecone at him. 

He growled, a low warning sound, slinking back 
toward the western rim, and I rethought my 
impatience. 

“It’s just us, Seth,” Jacob called from a distance.

Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I tried to explain to myself why my heart kicked into 
fourth gear when I heard him. It was just fear of what 
I was going to have to do now, that was all. I could 
not allow myself to be relieved that he’d come back. 
That would be the opposite of helpful. 

Edward walked into view first, his face blank and 
smooth. When he stepped out from the shadows, the 
sun shimmered on his skin like it did on the snow. 
Seth went to greet him, looking intently into his eyes. 
Edward nodded slowly, and worry creased his 
forehead. 

“Yes, that’s all we need,” he muttered to himself 
before addressing the big wolf. “I suppose we 
shouldn’t be surprised. But the timing is going to be 
very close. Please have Sam ask Alice to try to nail the 
schedule down better.” 

Seth dipped his head once, and I wished I was able to 
growl. Sure, he could nod now. I turned my head, 
annoyed, and realized that Jacob was there. 

He had his back to me, facing the way he’d come. I 
waited warily for him to turn around. 

“Bella,” Edward murmured, suddenly right beside me. 
He stared down at me with nothing but concern 
showing in his eyes. There was no end to his 
generosity. I deserved him now less than I ever had. 

“There’s a bit of a complication,” he told me, his voice 
carefully unworried. “I’m going to take Seth a little 
ways away and try to straighten it out. I won’t go far, 
but I won’t listen, either. I know you don’t want an 
audience, no matter which way you decide to go.” 

Only at the very end did the pain break into his voice.

I had to never hurt him again. That would be my 
mission in life. Never again would I be the reason for 
this look to come into his eyes. 

I was too upset to even ask him what the new 
problem was. I didn’t need anything else right now. 

“Hurry back,” I whispered. 

He kissed me lightly on the lips, and then 
disappeared into the forest with Seth at his side. 

Jacob was still in the shadow of the trees; I couldn’t 
see his expression clearly. 

“I’m in a hurry, Bella,” he said in a dull voice. “Why 
don’t you get it over with?” 

I swallowed, my throat suddenly so dry I wasn’t sure 
if I could make sound come out. 

“Just say the words, and be done with it.” 

I took a deep breath. 

“I’m sorry I’m such a rotten person,” I whispered. “I’m 
sorry I’ve been so selfish. I wish I’d never met you, so 
I couldn’t hurt you the way I have. I won’t do it 
anymore, I promise. I’ll stay far away from you. I’ll 
move out of the state. You won’t have to look at me 
ever again.” 

“That’s not much of an apology,” he said bitterly. 

I couldn’t make my voice louder than a whisper. “Tell 
me how to do it right.” 



561 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“What if I don’t want you to go away? What if I’d 
rather you stayed, selfish or not? Don’t I get any say, 
if you’re trying to make things up to me?” 

“That won’t help anything, Jake. It was wrong to stay 
with you when we wanted such different things. It’s 
not going to get better. I’ll just keep hurting you. I 
don’t want to hurt you anymore. I hate it.” My voice 
broke. 

He sighed. “Stop. You don’t have to say anything else. 

I understand.” 

I wanted to tell him how much I would miss him, but 
I bit my tongue. That would not help anything, either. 

He stood quietly for a moment, staring at the ground, 
and I fought against the urge to go and put my arms 
around him. To comfort him. 

And then his head snapped up. 

“Well, you’re not the only one capable of self- 
sacrifice,” he said, his voice stronger. “Two can play at 
that game.” 

“What?” 

“I’ve behaved pretty badly myself. I’ve made this much 
harder for you than I needed to. I could have given up 
with good grace in the beginning. But I hurt you, too.” 

“This is my fault.” 

“I won’t let you claim all the blame here, Bella. Or all 
the glory either. I know how to redeem myself.” 

“What are you talking about?” I demanded. The 
sudden, frenzied light in his eyes frightened me. 

562 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He glanced up at the sun and then smiled at me. 
“There’s a pretty serious fight brewing down there. I 
don’t think it will be that difficult to take myself out of 
the picture.” 

His words sank into my brain, slowly, one by one, and 
I couldn’t breathe. Despite all my intentions to cut 
Jacob out of my life completely, I didn’t realize until 
that precise second exactly how deep the knife would 
have to go to do it. 

“Oh, no, Jake! No, no no no,” I choked out in horror. 
“No, Jake, no. Please, no.” My knees began to 
tremble. 

“What’s the difference, Bella? This will only make it 
more convenient for everyone. You won’t even have to 
move.” 

“No!” My voice got louder. “No, Jacob! I won’t let you!” 

“How will you stop me?” he taunted lightly, smiling to 
take the sting out of his tone. 

“Jacob, I’m begging you. Stay with me.” I would have 
fallen to my knees, if I could have moved at all. 

“For fifteen minutes while I miss a good brawl? So 
that you can run away from me as soon as you think 
I’m safe again? You’ve got to be kidding.” 

“I won’t run away. I’ve changed my mind. We’ll work 
something out, Jacob. There’s always a compromise. 
Don’t go!” 

“You’re lying.” 

“I’m not. You know what a terrible liar I am. Look in 
my eyes. I’ll stay if you do.” 

563 I P a g e

His face hardened. “And I can be your best man at 
the wedding?” 

It was a moment before I could speak, and still the 
only answer I could give him was, “Please.” 

“That’s what I thought,” he said, his face going calm 
again, but for the turbulent light in his eyes. 

“I love you, Bella,” he murmured. 

“I love you, Jacob,” I whispered brokenly. 

He smiled. “I know that better than you do.” 

He turned to walk away. 

“Anything,” I called after him in a strangled voice. 
“Anything you want, Jacob. Just don’t do this!” 

He paused, turning slowly. 

“I don’t really think you mean that.” 

“Stay,” I begged. 

He shook his head. “No, I’m going.” He paused, as if 
deciding something. “But I could leave it to fate.” 

“What do you mean?” I choked out. 

“I don’t have to do anything deliberate — I could just 
do my best for my pack and let what happens 
happen.” He shrugged. “If you could convince me you 
really did want me to come back — more than you 
wanted to do the selfless thing.” 

“How?” I asked. 



564 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You could ask me,” he suggested. 

“Come back,” I whispered. How could he doubt that I 
meant it? 

He shook his head, smiling again. “That’s not what 
I’m talking about.” 

It took me a second to grasp what he was saying, and 
all the while he was looking at me with this superior 
expression — so sure of my reaction. As soon as the 
realization hit, though, I blurted out the words 
without stopping to count the cost. 

“Will you kiss me, Jacob?” 

His eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed 
suspiciously. “You’re bluffing.” 

“Kiss me, Jacob. Kiss me, and then come back.” 

He hesitated in the shadow, warring with himself. He 
half-turned again to the west, his torso twisting away 
from me while his feet stayed planted where they 
were. Still looking away, he took one uncertain step in 
my direction, and then another. He swung his face 
around to look at me, his eyes doubtful. 

I stared back. I had no idea what expression was on 
my face. 

Jacob rocked back on his heels, and then lurched 
forward, closing the distance between us in three long 
strides. 

I knew he would take advantage of the situation. I 
expected it. I held very still — my eyes closed, my 
fingers curled into fists at my sides — as his hands 



565 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




caught my face and his lips found mine with an 
eagerness that was not far from violence. 

I could feel his anger as his mouth discovered my 
passive resistance. One hand moved to the nape of 
my neck, twisting into a fist around the roots of my 
hair. The other hand grabbed roughly at my shoulder, 
shaking me, then dragging me to him. His hand 
continued down my arm, finding my wrist and pulling 
my arm up around his neck. I left it there, my hand 
still tightly balled up, unsure how far I could go in my 
desperation to keep him alive. All the while his lips, 
disconcertingly soft and warm, tried to force a 
response out of mine. 

As soon as he was sure I wouldn’t drop my arm, he 
freed my wrist, his hand feeling its way down to my 
waist. His burning hand found the skin at the small 
of my back, and he yanked me forward, bowing my 
body against his. 

His lips gave up on mine for a moment, but I knew he 
was nowhere close to finished. His mouth followed the 
line of my jaw, and then explored the length of my 
neck. He freed my hair, reaching for my other arm to 
draw it around his neck like the first. 

Then both of his arms were constricted around my 
waist, and his lips found my ear. 

“You can do better than this, Bella,” he whispered 
huskily. “You’re overthinking it.” 

I shivered as I felt his teeth graze my earlobe. 

“That’s right,” he murmured. “For once, just let 
yourself feel what you feel.” 



566 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I shook my head mechanically until one of his hands 
wound back into my hair and stopped me. 

His voice turned acidic. “Are you sure you want me to 
come back? Or did you really want me to die?” 

Anger rocked through me like the whiplash after a 
heavy punch. That was too much — he wasn’t 
fighting fair. 

My arms were already around his neck, so I grabbed 
two fistfuls of his hair — ignoring the stabbing pain in 
my right hand — and fought back, struggling to pull 
my face away from his. 

And Jacob misunderstood. 

He was too strong to recognize that my hands, trying 
to yank his hair out by the roots, meant to cause him 
pain. Instead of anger, he imagined passion. He 
thought I was finally responding to him. 

With a wild gasp, he brought his mouth back to mine, 
his fingers clutching frantically against the skin at my 
waist. 

The jolt of anger unbalanced my tenuous hold on self- 
control; his unexpected, ecstatic response overthrew 
it entirely. If there had been only triumph, I might 
have been able to resist him. But the utter 
defenselessness of his sudden joy cracked my 
determination, disabled it. My brain disconnected 
from my body, and I was kissing him back. Against all 
reason, my lips were moving with his in strange, 
confusing ways they’d never moved before — because 
I didn’t have to be careful with Jacob, and he 
certainly wasn’t being careful with me. 



567 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




My fingers tightened in his hair, but I was pulling him 
closer now. 



He was everywhere. The piercing sunlight turned my 
eyelids red, and the color fit, matched the heat. The 
heat was everywhere. I couldn’t see or hear or feel 
anything that wasn’t Jacob. 

The tiny piece of my brain that retained sanity 
screamed questions at me. 

Why wasn’t I stopping this? Worse than that, why 
couldn’t I find in myself even the desire to want to 
stop? What did it mean that I didn’t want him to 
stop? That my hands clung to his shoulders, and 
liked that they were wide and strong? That his hands 
pulled me too tight against his body, and yet it was 
not tight enough for me? 

The questions were stupid, because I knew the 
answer: I’d been lying to myself. 

Jacob was right. He’d been right all along. He was 
more than just my friend. That’s why it was so 
impossible to tell him goodbye — because I was in 
love with him. Too. I loved him, much more than I 
should, and yet, still nowhere near enough. I was in 
love with him, but it was not enough to change 
anything; it was only enough to hurt us both more. To 
hurt him worse than I ever had. 

I didn’t care about more than that — than his pain. I 
more than deserved whatever pain this caused me. I 
hoped it was bad. I hoped I would really suffer. 

In this moment, it felt as though we were the same 
person. His pain had always been and would always 
be my pain — now his joy was my joy. I felt joy, too, 
and yet his happiness was somehow also pain. 

568 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Almost tangible — it burned against my skin like 
acid, a slow torture. 

For one brief, never-ending second, an entirely 
different path expanded behind the lids of my tear- 
wet eyes. As if I were looking through the filter of 
Jacob’s thoughts, I could see exactly what I was going 
to give up, exactly what this new self-knowledge 
would not save me from losing. I could see Charlie 
and Renee mixed into a strange collage with Billy and 
Sam and La Push. I could see years passing, and 
meaning something as they passed, changing me. I 
could see the enormous red-brown wolf that I loved, 
always standing as protector if I needed him. For the 
tiniest fragment of that second, I saw the bobbing 
heads of two small, black-haired children, running 
away from me into the familiar forest. When they 
disappeared, they took the rest of the vision with 
them. 

And then, quite distinctly, I felt the splintering along 
the fissure line in my heart as the smaller part 
wrenched itself away from the whole. 

Jacob’s lips were still before mine were. I opened my 
eyes and he was staring at me with wonder and 
elation. 

“I have to leave,” he whispered. 

“No.” 

He smiled, pleased by my response. “I won’t be long,” 
he promised. “But one thing first ...” 

He bent to kiss me again, and there was no reason to 
resist. What would be the point? 



569 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




This time was different. His hands were soft on my 
face and his warm lips were gentle, unexpectedly 
hesitant. It was brief, and very, very sweet. 

His arms curled around me, and he hugged me 
securely while he whispered in my ear. 

“That should have been our first kiss. Better late than 
never.” 

Against his chest, where he couldn’t see, the tears 
welled up and spilled over.

SNAP DECISION 




I lay facedown across the sleeping bag, waiting for 
justice to find me. Maybe an avalanche would bury 
me here. I wished it would. I never wanted to have to 
see my face in the mirror again. 

There was no sound to warn me. Out of nowhere, 
Edward’s cold hand stroked against my knotted hair. 

I shuddered guiltily at his touch. 

“Are you all right?” he murmured, his voice anxious. 
“No. I want to die.” 

“That will never happen. I won’t allow it.” 

I groaned and then whispered, “You might change 
your mind about that.” 

“Where’s Jacob?” 

“He went to fight,” I mumbled into the floor. 

Jacob had left the little camp joyfully — with a 
cheerful “I’ll be right back” — running full tilt for the 
clearing, already quivering as he prepared to shift to 
his other self. By now the whole pack knew 
everything. Seth Clearwater, pacing outside the tent, 
was an intimate witness to my disgrace. 

Edward was silent for a long moment. “Oh,” he finally 
said. 

The tone of his voice worried me that my avalanche 
wasn’t coming fast enough. I peeked up at him and, 

571 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



sure enough, his eyes were unfocused as he listened 
to something I’d rather die than have him hear. I 
dropped my face back to the floor. 

It stunned me when Edward chuckled reluctantly. 

“And I thought I fought dirty,” he said with grudging 
admiration. “He makes me look like the patron saint 
of ethics.” His hand brushed against the part of my 
cheek that was exposed. “I’m not mad at you, love. 
Jacob’s more cunning than I gave him credit for. I do 
wish you hadn’t asked him, though.” 

“Edward,” I whispered to the rough nylon. “I ... I ... 

I’m — ” 



“Shh,” he hushed me, his fingers soothing against my 
cheek. “That’s not what I meant. It’s just that he 
would have kissed you anyway — even if you hadn’t 
fallen for it — and now I don’t have an excuse to 
break his face. I would have really enjoyed that, too.” 

“Fallen for it?” I mumbled almost incomprehensibly. 

“Bella, did you really believe he was that noble? That 
he would go out in a flame of glory just to clear the 
way for me?” 

I raised my head slowly to meet his patient gaze. His 
expression was soft; his eyes were full of 
understanding rather than the revulsion I deserved to 
see. 

“Yes, I did believe that,” I muttered, and then looked 
away. But I didn’t feel any anger at Jacob for tricking 
me. There wasn’t enough room in my body to contain 
anything besides the hatred I felt toward myself. 



572 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Edward laughed softly again. “You’re such a bad liar, 
you’ll believe anyone who has the least bit of skill.” 



“Why aren’t you angry with me?” I whispered. “Why 
don’t you hate me? Or haven’t you heard the whole 
story yet?” 

“I think I got a fairly comprehensive look,” he said in a 
light, easy voice. “Jacob makes vivid mental pictures. 

I feel almost as bad for his pack as I do for myself. 
Poor Seth was getting nauseated. But Sam is making 
Jacob focus now.” 

I closed my eyes and shook my head in agony. The 
sharp nylon fibers of the tent floor scraped against my 
skin. 

“You’re only human,” he whispered, stroking my hair 
again. 

“That’s the most miserable defense I’ve ever heard.” 

“But you are human, Bella. And, as much as I might 
wish otherwise, so is he... . There are holes in your 
life that I can’t fill. I understand that.” 

“But that’s not true. That’s what makes me so 
horrible. There are no holes.” 

“You love him,” he murmured gently. 

Every cell in my body ached to deny it. 

“I love you more,” I said. It was the best I could do. 

“Yes, I know that, too. But ... when I left you, Bella, I 
left you bleeding. Jacob was the one to stitch you 
back up again. That was bound to leave its mark — 
on both of you. I’m not sure those kinds of stitches 

573 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




dissolve on their own. I can’t blame either of you for 
something I made necessary. I may gain forgiveness, 
but that doesn’t let me escape the consequences.” 

“I should have known you’d find some way to blame 
yourself. Please stop. I can’t stand it.” 

“What would you like me to say?” 

“I want you to call me every bad name you can think 
of, in every language you know. I want you to tell me 
that you’re disgusted with me and that you’re going to 
leave so that I can beg and grovel on my knees for you 
to stay.” 

“I’m sorry.” He sighed. “I can’t do that.” 

“At least stop trying to make me feel better. Let me 
suffer. I deserve it.” 

“No,” he murmured. 

I nodded slowly. “You’re right. Keep on being too 
understanding. That’s probably worse.” 

He was silent for a moment, and I sensed a charge in 
the atmosphere, a new urgency. 

“It’s getting close,” I stated. 

“Yes, a few more minutes now. Just enough time to 
say one more thing... .” 

I waited. When he finally spoke again, he was 
whispering. “I can be noble, Bella. I’m not going to 
make you choose between us. Just be happy, and you 
can have whatever part of me you want, or none at 
all, if that’s better. Don’t let any debt you feel you owe 
me influence your decision.” 

574 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I pushed off the floor, shoving myself up onto my 
knees. 



“Dammit, stop that!” I shouted at him. 

His eyes widened in surprise. “No — you don’t 
understand. I’m not just trying to make you feel 
better, Bella, I really mean it.” 

“I know you do,” I groaned. “What happened to 
fighting back? Don’t start with the noble self-sacrifice 
now! Fight!” 

“How?” he asked, and his eyes were ancient with their 
sadness. 

I scrambled into his lap, throwing my arms around 
him. 

“I don’t care that it’s cold here. I don’t care that I 
stink like a dog right now. Make me forget how awful I 
am. Make me forget him. Make me forget my own 
name. Fight back!” 

I didn’t wait for him to decide — or to have the chance 
to tell me he wasn’t interested in a cruel, faithless 
monster like me. I pulled myself against him and 
crushed my mouth to his snow-cold lips. 

“Careful, love,” he murmured under my urgent kiss. 

“No,” I growled. 

He gently pushed my face a few inches back. “You 
don’t have to prove anything to me.” 

“I’m not trying to prove something. You said I could 
have any part of you I wanted. I want this part. I want 
every part.” I wrapped my arms around his neck and 

575 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




strained to reach his lips. He bent his head to kiss me 
back, but his cool mouth was hesitant as my 
impatience grew more pronounced. My body was 
making my intentions clear, giving me away. 
Inevitably, his hands moved to restrain me. 

“Perhaps this isn’t the best moment for that,” he 
suggested, too calm for my liking. 

“Why not?” I grumbled. There was no point in fighting 
if he was going to be rational; I dropped my arms. 

“Firstly, because it is cold.” He reached out to pull the 
sleeping bag off the floor; he wrapped it around me 
like a blanket. 

“Wrong,” I said. “First, because you are bizarrely 
moral for a vampire.” 

He chuckled. “All right, I’ll give you that. The cold is 
second. And thirdly ... well, you do actually stink, 
love.” 

He wrinkled his nose. 

I sighed. 

“Fourthly,” he murmured, dropping his face so that 
he was whispering in my ear. “We will try, Bella. I’ll 
make good on my promise. But I’d much rather it 
wasn’t in reaction to Jacob Black.” 

I cringed, and buried my face against his shoulder. 

“And fifthly ...” 

“This is a very long list,” I muttered. 



576 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He laughed. “Yes, but did you want to listen to the 
fight or not?” 

As he spoke, Seth howled stridently outside the tent. 

My body stiffened to the sound. I didn’t realize my left 
hand was clenched into a fist, nails biting into my 
bandaged palm, until Edward took it and gently 
smoothed my fingers out. 

“It’s going to be fine, Bella,” he promised. “We’ve got 
skill, training, and surprise on our side. It will be over 
very soon. If I didn’t truly believe that, I would be 
down there now — and you’d be here, chained to a 
tree or something along those lines.” 

“Alice is so small,” I moaned. 

He chuckled. “That might be a problem ... if it were 
possible for someone to catch her.” 

Seth started to whimper. 

“What’s wrong?” I demanded. 

“He’s just angry that he’s stuck here with us. He 
knows the pack kept him out of the action to protect 
him. He’s salivating to join them.” 

I scowled in Seth’s general direction. 

“The newborns have reached the end of the trail — it 
worked like a charm, Jasper’s a genius — and they’ve 
caught the scent of the ones in the meadow, so 
they’re splitting into two groups now, as Alice said,” 
Edward murmured, his eyes focused on something far 
away. “Sam’s taking us around to head off the 
ambush party.” He was so intent on what he was 
hearing that he used the pack plural. 

577 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Suddenly he looked down at me. “Breathe, Bella.” 

I struggled to do what he asked. I could hear Seth’s 
heavy panting just outside the tent wall, and I tried to 
keep my lungs on the same even pace, so that I 
wouldn’t hyperventilate. 

“The first group is in the clearing. We can hear the 
fighting.” 

My teeth locked together. 

He laughed once. “We can hear Emmett — he’s 
enjoying himself.” 

I made myself take another breath with Seth. 

“The second group is getting ready — they aren’t 
paying attention, they haven’t heard us yet.” 

Edward growled. 

“What?” I gasped. 

“They’re talking about you.” His teeth clenched 
together. “They’re supposed to make sure you don’t 
escape... . Nice move, Leah! Mmm, she’s quite fast,” 
he murmured in approval. “One of the newborns 
caught our scent, and Leah took him down before he 
could even turn. Sam’s helping her finish him off. 

Paul and Jacob got another one, but the others are on 
the defensive now. They have no idea what to make of 
us. Both sides are feinting... . No, let Sam lead. Stay 
out of the way,” he muttered. “Separate them — don’t 
let them protect each other’s backs.” 

Seth whined. 



578 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“That’s better, drive them toward the clearing,” 

Edward approved. His body was shifting 
unconsciously as he watched, tensing for moves he 
would have made. His hands still held mine; I twisted 
my fingers through his. At least he wasn’t down there. 

The sudden absence of sound was the only warning. 

The deep rush of Seth’s breathing cut off, and — as 
I’d paced my breaths with his — I noticed. 

I stopped breathing, too — too frightened to even 
make my lungs work as I realized that Edward had 
frozen into a block of ice beside me. 

Oh, no. No. No. 

Who had been lost? Theirs or ours? Mine, all mine. 
What was my loss? 

So quickly that I wasn’t exactly sure how it happened, 
I was on my feet and the tent was collapsing in ragged 
shreds around me. Had Edward ripped our way out? 
Why? 

I blinked, shocked, into the brilliant light. Seth was 
all I could see, right beside us, his face only six 
inches from Edward’s. They stared at each other with 
absolute concentration for one infinite second. The 
sun shattered off Edward’s skin and sent sparkles 
dancing across Seth’s fur. 

And then Edward whispered urgently, “Go, Seth!” 

The huge wolf wheeled and disappeared into the 
forest shadows. 

Had two entire seconds passed? It felt like hours. I 
was terrified to the point of nausea by the knowledge 

579 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




that something horrible had gone awry in the 
clearing. I opened my mouth to demand that Edward 
take me there, and do it now. They needed him, and 
they needed me. If I had to bleed to save them, I 
would do it. I would die to do it, like the third wife. I 
had no silver dagger in my hand, but I would find a 
way — 

Before I could get the first syllable out, I felt as if I 
was being flung through the air. But Edward’s hands 
never let go of me — I was only being moved, so 
quickly that the sensation was like falling sideways. 

I found myself with my back pressed against the 
sheer cliff face. Edward stood in front of me, holding a 
posture that I knew at once. 

Relief washed through my mind at the same time that 
my stomach dropped through the soles of my feet. 

I’d misunderstood. 

Relief — nothing had gone wrong in the clearing. 
Horror — the crisis was here. 

Edward held a defensive position — half-crouched, 
his arms extended slightly — that I recognized with 
sickening certainty. The rock at my back could have 
been the ancient brick walls of the Italian alley where 
he had stood between me and the black-cloaked 
Volturi warriors. 

Something was coming for us. 

“Who?” I whispered. 

The words came through his teeth in a snarl that was 
louder than I expected. Too loud. It meant that it was 

580 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




far too late to hide. We were trapped, and it didn’t 
matter who heard his answer. 

“Victoria,” he said, spitting the word, making it a 
curse. “She’s not alone. She crossed my scent, 
following the newborns in to watch — she never 
meant to fight with them. She made a spur-of-the- 
moment decision to find me, guessing that you would 
be wherever I was. She was right. You were right. It 
was always Victoria.” 

She was close enough that he could hear her 
thoughts. 

Relief again. If it had been the Volturi, we were both 
dead. But with Victoria, it didn’t have to be both. 
Edward could survive this. He was a good fighter, as 
good as Jasper. If she didn’t bring too many others, 
he could fight his way out, back to his family. Edward 
was faster than anyone. He could make it. 

I was so glad he’d sent Seth away. Of course, there 
was no one Seth could run to for help. Victoria had 
timed her decision perfectly. But at least Seth was 
safe; I couldn’t see the huge sandy wolf in my head 
when I thought his name — just the gangly fifteen- 
year- old boy. 

Edward’s body shifted — only infinitesimally, but it 
told me where to look. I stared at the black shadows 
of the forest. 

It was like having my nightmares walk forward to 
greet me. 

Two vampires edged slowly into the small opening of 
our camp, eyes intent, missing nothing. They 
glistened like diamonds in the sun. 



581 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I could barely look at the blond boy — yes, he was 
just a boy, though he was muscular and tall, maybe 
my age when he was changed. His eyes — a more 
vivid red than I had ever seen before — could not hold 
mine. Though he was closest to Edward, the nearest 
danger, I could not watch him. 

Because, a few feet to the side and a few feet back, 
Victoria was staring at me. 

Her orange hair was brighter than I’d remembered, 
more like a flame. There was no wind here, but the 
fire around her face seemed to shimmer slightly, as if 
it were alive. 

Her eyes were black with thirst. She did not smile, as 
she always had in my nightmares — her lips were 
pressed into a tight line. There was a striking feline 
quality to the way she held her coiled body, a lioness 
waiting for an opening to spring. Her restless, wild 
gaze flickered between Edward and me, but never 
rested on him for more than a half-second. She could 
not keep her eyes from my face any more than I could 
keep mine from hers. 

Tension rolled off of her, nearly visible in the air. I 
could feel the desire, the all-consuming passion that 
held her in its grip. Almost as if I could hear her 
thoughts, too, I knew what she was thinking. 

She was so close to what she wanted — the focus of 
her whole existence for more than a year now was 
just so close. 

My death. 

Her plan was as obvious as it was practical. The big 
blond boy would attack Edward. As soon as Edward 
was sufficiently distracted, Victoria would finish me. 

582 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




It would be quick — she had no time for games here 
— but it would be thorough. Something that it would 
be impossible to recover from. Something that even 
vampire venom could not repair. 

She’d have to stop my heart. Perhaps a hand shoved 
through my chest, crushing it. Something along those 
lines. 

My heart beat furiously, loudly, as if to make her 
target more obvious. 

An immense distance away, from far across the black 
forest, a wolfs howl echoed in the still air. With Seth 
gone, there was no way to interpret the sound. 

The blond boy looked at Victoria from the corner of 
his eye, waiting on her command. 

He was young in more ways than one. I guessed from 
his brilliant crimson irises that he couldn’t have been 
a vampire for very long. He would be strong, but 
inept. Edward would know how to fight him. Edward 
would survive. 

Victoria jerked her chin toward Edward, wordlessly 
ordering the boy forward. 

“Riley,” Edward said in a soft, pleading voice. 

The blond boy froze, his red eyes widening. 

“She’s lying to you, Riley,” Edward told him. “Listen to 
me. She’s lying to you just like she lied to the others 
who are dying now in the clearing. You know that 
she’s lied to them, that she had you lie to them, that 
neither of you were ever going to help them. Is it so 
hard to believe that she’s lied to you, too?” 



583 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Confusion swept across Riley’s face. 

Edward shifted a few inches to the side, and Riley 
automatically compensated with an adjustment of his 
own. 

“She doesn’t love you, Riley.” Edward’s soft voice was 
compelling, almost hypnotic. “She never has. She 
loved someone named James, and you’re no more 
than a tool to her.” 

When he said James’s name, Victoria’s lips pulled 
back in a teeth-baring grimace. Her eyes stayed 
locked on me. 

Riley cast a frantic glance in her direction. 

“Riley?” Edward said. 

Riley automatically refocused on Edward. 

“She knows that I will kill you, Riley. She wants you 
to die so that she doesn’t have to keep up the 
pretense anymore. Yes — you’ve seen that, haven’t 
you? You’ve read the reluctance in her eyes, 
suspected a false note in her promises. You were 
right. She’s never wanted you. Every kiss, every touch 
was a lie.” 

Edward moved again, moved a few inches toward the 
boy, a few inches away from me. 

Victoria’s gaze zeroed in on the gap between us. It 
would take her less than a second to kill me — she 
only needed the tiniest margin of opportunity. 

Slower this time, Riley repositioned himself. 



584 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You don’t have to die,” Edward promised, his eyes 
holding the boy’s. “There are other ways to live than 
the way she’s shown you. It’s not all lies and blood, 
Riley. You can walk away right now. You don’t have to 
die for her lies.” 

Edward slid his feet forward and to the side. There 
was a foot of space between us now. Riley circled too 
far, overcompensating this time. Victoria leaned 
forward onto the balls of her feet. 

“Last chance, Riley,” Edward whispered. 

Riley’s face was desperate as he looked to Victoria for 
answers. 

“He’s the liar, Riley,” Victoria said, and my mouth fell 
open in shock at the sound of her voice. “I told you 
about their mind tricks. You know I love only you.” 

Her voice was not the strong, wild, catlike growl I 
would have put with her face and stance. It was soft, 
it was high — a babyish, soprano tinkling. The kind of 
voice that went with blond curls and pink bubble 
gum. It made no sense coming through her bared, 
glistening teeth. 

Riley’s jaw tightened, and he squared his shoulders. 
His eyes emptied — there was no more confusion, no 
more suspicion. There was no thought at all. He 
tensed himself to attack. 

Victoria’s body seemed to be trembling, she was so 
tightly wound. Her fingers were ready claws, waiting 
for Edward to move just one more inch away from me. 

The snarl came from none of them. 



585 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




A mammoth tan shape flew through the center of the 
opening, throwing Riley to the ground. 

“No!” Victoria cried, her baby voice shrill with 
disbelief. 

A yard and a half in front of me, the huge wolf ripped 
and tore at the blond vampire beneath him. 

Something white and hard smacked into the rocks by 
my feet. I cringed away from it. 

Victoria did not spare one glance for the boy she’d 
just pledged her love to. Her eyes were still on me, 
filled with a disappointment so ferocious that she 
looked deranged. 

“No,” she said again, through her teeth, as Edward 
started to move toward her, blocking her path to me. 

Riley was on his feet again, looking misshapen and 
haggard, but he was able to fling a vicious kick into 
Seth’s shoulder. I heard the bone crunch. Seth 
backed off and started to circle, limping. Riley had his 
arms out, ready, though he seemed to be missing part 
of one hand... . 

Only a few yards away from that fight, Edward and 
Victoria were dancing. 

Not quite circling, because Edward was not allowing 
her to position herself closer to me. She sashayed 
back, moving from side to side, trying to find a hole in 
his defense. He shadowed her footwork lithely, 
stalking her with perfect concentration. He began to 
move just a fraction of a second before she moved, 
reading her intentions in her thoughts. 

Seth lunged at Riley from the side, and something 
tore with a hideous, grating screech. Another heavy 

586 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




white chunk flew into the forest with a thud. Riley 
roared in fury, and Seth skipped back — amazingly 
light on his feet for his size — as Riley took a swipe at 
him with one mangled hand. 

Victoria was weaving through the tree trunks at the 
far end of the little opening now. She was torn, her 
feet pulling her toward safety while her eyes yearned 
toward me as if I were a magnet, reeling her in. I 
could see the burning desire to kill warring with her 
survival instinct. 

Edward could see that, too. 

“Don’t go, Victoria,” he murmured in that same 
hypnotic tone as before. “You’ll never get another 
chance like this.” 

She showed her teeth and hissed at him, but she 
seemed unable to move farther away from me. 

“You can always run later,” Edward purred. “Plenty of 
time for that. It’s what you do, isn’t it? It’s why James 
kept you around. Useful, if you like to play deadly 
games. A partner with an uncanny instinct for 
escaping. He shouldn’t have left you — he could have 
used your skills when we caught up to him in 
Phoenix.” 

A snarl ripped from between her lips. 

“That’s all you ever were to him, though. Silly to 
waste so much energy avenging someone who had 
less affection for you than a hunter for his mount. 

You were never more than a convenience to him. I 
would know.” 

Edward’s lips pulled up on one side as he tapped his 
temple. 

587 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




With a strangled screech, Victoria darted out of the 
trees again, feinting to the side. Edward responded, 
and the dance began again. 

Just then, Riley’s fist caught Seth’s flank, and a low 
yelp coughed out of Seth’s throat. Seth backed away, 
his shoulders twitching as if he were trying to shake 
off the pain. 

Please, I wanted to plead with Riley, but I couldn’t 
find the muscles to make my mouth open, to pull the 
air up from my lungs. Please, he’s just a child! 

Why hadn’t Seth run away? Why didn’t he run now? 

Riley was closing the distance between them again, 
driving Seth toward the cliff face beside me. Victoria 
was suddenly interested in her partner’s fate. I could 
see her, from the corner of her eyes, judge the 
distance between Riley and me. Seth snapped at 
Riley, forcing him back again, and Victoria hissed. 

Seth wasn’t limping anymore. His circling took him 
within inches of Edward; his tail brushed Edward’s 
back, and Victoria’s eyes bulged. 

“No, he won’t turn on me,” Edward said, answering 
the question in Victoria’s head. He used her 
distraction to slide closer. “You provided us with a 
common enemy. You allied us.” 

She clenched her teeth, trying to keep her focus on 
Edward alone. 

“Look more closely, Victoria,” he murmured, pulling 
at the threads of her concentration. “Is he really so 
much like the monster James tracked across 
Siberia?” 



588 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Her eyes popped wide open, and then began flickering 
wildly from Edward to Seth to me, around and 
around. “Not the same?” she snarled in her little girl’s 
soprano. “Impossible!” 

“Nothing is impossible,” Edward murmured, voice 
velvet soft as he moved another inch closer to her. 
“Except what you want. You’ll never touch her.” 

She shook her head, fast and jerky, fighting his 
diversions, and tried to duck around him, but he was 
in place to block her as soon as she’d thought of the 
plan. Her face contorted in frustration, and then she 
shifted lower into her crouch, a lioness again, and 
stalked deliberately forward. 

Victoria was no inexperienced, instinct-driven 
newborn. She was lethal. Even I could tell the 
difference between her and Riley, and I knew that 
Seth wouldn’t have lasted so long if he’d been fighting 
this vampire. 

Edward shifted, too, as they closed on each other, 
and it was lion versus lioness. 

The dance increased in tempo. 

It was like Alice and Jasper in the meadow, a blurred 
spiraling of movement, only this dance was not as 
perfectly choreographed. Sharp crunches and 
crackings reverberated off the cliff face whenever 
someone slipped in their formation. But they were 
moving too fast for me to see who was making the 
mistakes... . 

Riley was distracted by the violent ballet, his eyes 
anxious for his partner. Seth struck, crunching off 
another small piece of the vampire. Riley bellowed 
and launched a massive backhanded blow that 

589 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




caught Seth full in his broad chest. Seth’s huge body 
soared ten feet and crashed into the rocky wall over 
my head with a force that seemed to shake the whole 
peak. I heard the breath whoosh from his lungs, and I 
ducked out of the way as he rebounded off the stone 
and collapsed on the ground a few feet in front of me. 

A low whimper escaped through Seth’s teeth. 

Sharp fragments of gray stone showered down on my 
head, scratching my exposed skin. A jagged spike of 
rock rolled down my right arm and I caught it 
reflexively. My fingers clenched around the long shard 
as my own survival instincts kicked in; since there 
was no chance of flight, my body — not caring how 
ineffectual the gesture was — prepared for a fight. 

Adrenaline jolted through my veins. I knew the brace 
was cutting into my palm. I knew the crack in my 
knuckle was protesting. I knew it, but I could not feel 
the pain. 

Behind Riley, all I could see was the twisting flame of 
Victoria’s hair and a blur of white. The increasingly 
frequent metallic snaps and tears, the gasps and 
shocked hissings, made it clear that the dance was 
turning deadly for someone. 

But which someone? 

Riley lurched toward me, his red eyes brilliant with 
fury. He glared at the limp mountain of sand-colored 
fur between us, and his hands — mangled, broken 
hands — curled into talons. His mouth opened, 
widened, his teeth glistening, as he prepared to rip 
out Seth’s throat. 

A second kick of adrenaline hit like an electric shock, 
and everything was suddenly very clear. 

590 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Both fights were too close. Seth was about to lose his, 
and I had no idea if Edward was winning or losing. 
They needed help. A distraction. Something to give 
them an edge. 

My hand gripped the stone spike so tightly that a 
support in the brace snapped. 

Was I strong enough? Was I brave enough? How hard 
could I shove the rough stone into my body? Would 
this buy Seth enough time to get back on his feet? 
Would he heal fast enough for my sacrifice to do him 
any good? 

I raked the point of the shard up my arm, yanking my 
thick sweater back to expose the skin, and then 
pressed the sharp tip to the crease at my elbow. I 
already had a long scar there from my last birthday. 
That night, my flowing blood had been enough to 
catch every vampire’s attention, to freeze them all in 
place for an instant. I prayed it would work that way 
again. I steeled myself and sucked in one deep breath. 

Victoria was distracted by the sound of my gasp. Her 
eyes, holding still for one tiny portion of a second, met 
mine. Fury and curiosity mingled strangely in her 
expression. 

I wasn’t sure how I heard the low sound with all the 
other noises echoing off the stone wall and 
hammering inside my head. My own heartbeat should 
have been enough to drown it out. But, in the split 
second that I stared into Victoria’s eyes, I thought I 
heard a familiar, exasperated sigh. 

In that same short second, the dance broke violently 
apart. It happened so quickly that it was over before I 
could follow the sequence of events. I tried to catch 
up in my head. 

591 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Victoria had flown out of the blurred formation and 
smashed into a tall spruce about halfway up the tree. 
She dropped back to the earth already crouched to 
spring. 

Simultaneously, Edward — all but invisible with 
speed — had twisted backward and caught the 
unsuspecting Riley by the arm. It had looked like 
Edward planted his foot against Riley’s back, and 
heaved — 

The little campsite was filled with Riley’s piercing 
shriek of agony. 

At the same time, Seth leaped to his feet, cutting off 
most of my view. 

But I could still see Victoria. And, though she looked 
oddly deformed — as if she were unable to straighten 
up completely — I could see the smile I’d been 
dreaming of flash across her wild face. 

She coiled and sprang. 

Something small and white whistled through the air 
and collided with her mid-flight. The impact sounded 
like an explosion, and it threw her against another 
tree — this one snapped in half. She landed on her 
feet again, crouched and ready, but Edward was 
already in place. Relief swelled in my heart when I 
saw that he stood straight and perfect. 

Victoria kicked something aside with a flick of her 
bare foot — the missile that had crippled her attack. 
It rolled toward me, and I realized what it was. 

My stomach lurched. 



592 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




The fingers were still twitching; grasping at blades of 
grass, Riley’s arm began to drag itself mindlessly 
across the ground. 

Seth was circling Riley again, and now Riley was 
retreating. He backed away from the advancing 
werewolf, his face rigid with pain. He raised his one 
arm defensively. 

Seth rushed Riley, and the vampire was clearly off- 
balance. I saw Seth sink his teeth into Riley’s 
shoulder and tear, jumping back again. 

With an earsplitting metallic screech, Riley lost his 
other arm. 

Seth shook his head, flinging the arm into the woods. 
The broken hissing noise that came through Seth’s 
teeth sounded like snickering. 

Riley screamed out a tortured plea. “Victoria!” 

Victoria did not even flinch to the sound of her name. 
Her eyes did not flicker once toward her partner. 

Seth launched himself forward with the force of a 
wrecking ball. The thrust carried both Seth and Riley 
into the trees, where the metallic screeching was 
matched by Riley’s screams. Screams that abruptly 
cut off, while the sounds of rock being ripped to 
shreds continued. 

Though she spared Riley no farewell glance, Victoria 
seemed to realize that she was on her own. She began 
to back away from Edward, frenzied disappointment 
blazing in her eyes. She threw me one short, agonized 
stare of longing, and then she started to retreat 
faster. 



593 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“No,” Edward crooned, his voice seductive. “Stay just 
a little longer.” 

She wheeled and flew toward the refuge of the forest 
like an arrow from a bow. 

But Edward was faster — a bullet from a gun. 

He caught her unprotected back at the edge of the 
trees and, with one last, simple step, the dance was 
over. 

Edward’s mouth brushed once across her neck, like a 
caress. The squealing clamor coming from Seth’s 
efforts covered every other noise, so there was no 
discernible sound to make the image one of violence. 
He could have been kissing her. 

And then the fiery tangle of hair was no longer 
connected to the rest of her body. The shivering 
orange waves fell to the ground, and bounced once 
before rolling toward the trees. 



594 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 





I forced my eyes — frozen wide open with shock — to 
move, so that I could not examine too closely the oval 
object wrapped in tendrils of shivering, fiery hair. 

Edward was in motion again. Swift and coolly 
businesslike, he dismembered the headless corpse. 

I could not go to him — I could not make my feet 
respond; they were bolted to the stone beneath them. 
But I scrutinized his every action minutely, looking 
for any evidence that he had been harmed. My heart 
slowed to a healthier rhythm when I found nothing. 

He was lithe and graceful as ever. I couldn’t even see 
a tear in his clothes. 

He did not look at me — where I stood frozen to the 
cliff wall, horrified — while he piled the quivering, 
twitching limbs and then covered them with dry pine 
needles. He still did not meet my shocked gaze as he 
darted into the forest after Seth. 

I didn’t have time to recover before both he and Seth 
were back, Edward with his arms full of Riley. Seth 
was carrying a large chunk — the torso — in his 
mouth. They added their burden to the pile, and 
Edward pulled a silver rectangle from his pocket. He 
flipped open the butane lighter and held the flame to 
the dry tinder. It caught at once; long tongues of 
orange fire licked rapidly across the pyre. 

“Get every piece,” Edward said in a low aside to Seth. 

Together, the vampire and the werewolf scoured the 
campsite, occasionally tossing small lumps of white 

595 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



stone into the blaze. Seth handled the pieces with his 
teeth. My brain wasn’t working well enough for me to 
understand why he didn’t change back to a form with 
hands. 

Edward kept his eyes on his work. 

And then they were done, and the raging fire was 
sending a pillar of choking purple toward the sky. The 
thick smoke curled up slowly, looking more solid than 
it should; it smelled like burning incense, and the 
scent was uncomfortable. It was heavy, too strong. 

Seth made that snickering sound again, deep in his 
chest. 

A smile flickered across Edward’s tense face. 

Edward stretched out his arm, his hand curled into a 
fist. Seth grinned, revealing the long row of dagger 
teeth, and bumped his nose against Edward’s hand. 

“Nice teamwork,” Edward murmured. 

Seth coughed a laugh. 

Then Edward took a deep breath, and turned slowly 
to face me. 

I did not understand his expression. His eyes were as 
wary as if I were another enemy — more than wary, 
they were afraid. Yet he’d shown no fear at all when 
he’d faced Victoria and Riley... . My mind was stuck, 
stunned and useless as my body. I stared at him, 
bewildered. 

“Bella, love,” he said in his softest tone, walking 
toward me with exaggerated slowness, his hands held 
up, palms forward. Dazed as I was, it reminded me 

596 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




oddly of a suspect approaching a policeman, showing 
that he wasn’t armed... . 

“Bella, can you drop the rock, please? Carefully. Don’t 
hurt yourself.” 

I’d forgotten all about my crude weapon, though I 
realized now that I was grasping it so hard that my 
knuckle was screaming in protest. Was it rebroken? 
Carlisle would put me in a cast for sure this time. 

Edward hesitated a few feet from me, his hands still 
in the air, his eyes still fearful. 

It took me a few long seconds to remember how to 
move my fingers. Then the rock clattered to the 
ground, while my hand stayed frozen in the same 
position. 

Edward relaxed slightly when my hands were empty, 
but came no closer. 

“You don’t have to be afraid, Bella,” Edward 
murmured. “You’re safe. I won’t hurt you.” 

The mystifying promise only confused me further. I 
stared at him like an imbecile, trying to understand. 

“It’s going to be all right, Bella. I know you’re 
frightened now, but it’s over. No one is going to hurt 
you. I won’t touch you. I won’t hurt you,” he said 
again. 

My eyes blinked furiously, and I found my voice. “Why 
do you keep saying that?” 

I took an unsteady step toward him, and he leaned 
away from my advance. 



597 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“What’s wrong?” I whispered. “What do you mean?” 

“Are you ...” His golden eyes were suddenly as 
confused as I felt. “Aren’t you afraid of me?” 

“Afraid of you? Why?” 

I staggered forward another step, and then tripped 
over something — my own feet probably. Edward 
caught me, and I buried my face in his chest and 
started to sob. 

“Bella, Bella, I’m so sorry. It’s over, it’s over.” 

“I’m fine,” I gasped. “I’m okay. I’m just. Freaking out. 
Give me. A minute.” 

His arms tightened around me. “I’m so sorry,” he 
murmured again and again. 

I clung to him until I could breathe, and then I was 
kissing him — his chest, his shoulder, his neck — 
every part of him that I could reach. Slowly, my brain 
started to work again. 

“Are you okay?” I demanded between kisses. “Did she 
hurt you at all?” 

“I am absolutely fine,” he promised, burying his face 
in my hair. 

“Seth?” 

Edward chuckled. “More than fine. Very pleased with 
himself, in fact.” 

“The others? Alice, Esme? The wolves? 



598 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“All fine. It’s over there, too. It went just as smoothly 
as I promised. We got the worst of it here.” 

I let myself absorb that for a moment, let it sink in 
and settle in my head. 

My family and my friends were safe. Victoria was 
never coming after me again. It was over. 

We were all going to be fine. 

But I couldn’t completely take in the good news while 
I was still so confused. 

“Tell me why,” I insisted. “Why did you think I would 
be afraid of you?” 

“I’m sorry,” he said, apologizing yet again — for what? 
I had no idea. “So sorry. I didn’t want you to see that. 
See me like that. I know I must have terrified you.” 

I had to think about that for another minute, about 
the hesitant way he’d approached me, his hands in 
the air. Like I was going to run if he moved too fast... . 

“Seriously?” I finally asked. “You ... what? Thought 
you’d scared me off?” I snorted. Snorting was good; a 
voice couldn’t tremble or break during a snort. It 
sounded impressively offhand. 

He put his hand under my chin and tilted my head 
back to read my face. 

“Bella, I just” — he hesitated and then forced the 
words out — “I just beheaded and dismembered a 
sentient creature not twenty yards from you. That 
doesn’t bother you?” 



He frowned at me. 

599 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I shrugged. Shrugging was good, too. Very blase. “Not 
really. I was only afraid that you and Seth were going 
to get hurt. I wanted to help, but there’s only so much 
I can do... .” 

His suddenly livid expression made my voice fade out. 

“Yes,” he said, his tone clipped. “Your little stunt with 
the rock. You know that you nearly gave me a heart 
attack? Not the easiest thing to do, that.” 

His furious glower made it hard to answer. 

“I wanted to help ... Seth was hurt... .” 

“Seth was only feigning that he was hurt, Bella. It was 
a trick. And then you ... !” He shook his head, unable 
to finish. “Seth couldn’t see what you were doing, so I 
had to step in. Seth’s a bit disgruntled that he can’t 
claim a single-handed defeat now.” 

“Seth was . . . faking?” 

Edward nodded sternly. 

“Oh.” 

We both looked at Seth, who was studiously ignoring 
us, watching the flames. Smugness radiated from 
every hair in his fur. 

“Well, I didn’t know that,” I said, on the offense now. 
“And it’s not easy being the only helpless person 
around. Just you wait till I’m a vampire! I’m not going 
to be sitting on the sidelines next time.” 

A dozen emotions flitted across his face before he 
settled on being amused. “Next time? Did you 
anticipate another war soon?”

“With my luck? Who knows?” 



He rolled his eyes, but I could see that he was flying 

— the relief was making us both lightheaded. It was 
over. 

Or ... was it? 

“Hold on. Didn’t you say something before — ?” I 
flinched, remembering what exactly it had been before 

— what was I going to say to Jacob? My splintered 
heart throbbed out a painful, aching beat. It was hard 
to believe, almost impossible, but the hardest part of 
this day was not behind me — and then I soldiered 
on. “About a complication? And Alice, needing to nail 
down the schedule for Sam. You said it was going to 
be close. What was going to be close?” 

Edward’s eyes flickered back to Seth, and they 
exchanged a loaded glance. 

“Well?” I asked. 

“It’s nothing, really,” Edward said quickly. “But we do 
need to be on our way... .” 

He started to pull me into place on his back, but I 
stiffened and drew away. 

“Define nothing.” 

Edward took my face between his palms. “We only 
have a minute, so don’t panic, all right? I told you 
that you had no reason to be afraid. Trust me on that, 
please?” 

I nodded, trying to hide the sudden terror — how 
much more could I handle before I collapsed? “No 
reason to be afraid. Got it.” 

601 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He pursed his lips for a second, deciding what to say. 
And then he glanced abruptly at Seth, as if the wolf 
had called him. 

“What’s she doing?” Edward asked. 

Seth whined; it was an anxious, uneasy sound. It 
made the hair on the back of my neck rise. 

Everything was dead silent for one endless second. 

And then Edward gasped, “No!” and one of his hands 
flew out as if to grab something that I couldn’t see. 
“Don’t — !” 



A spasm rocked through Seth’s body, and a howl, 
blistering with agony, ripped from his lungs. 

Edward fell to his knees at the exact same moment, 
gripping the sides of his head with two hands, his 
face furrowed in pain. 

I screamed once in bewildered terror, and dropped to 
my knees beside him. Stupidly, I tried to pull his 
hands from his face; my palms, clammy with sweat, 
slid off his marble skin. 

“Edward! Edward!” 

His eyes focused on me; with obvious effort, he pulled 
his clenched teeth apart. 

“It’s okay. We’re going to be fine. It’s — ” He broke off, 
and winced again. 

“What’s happening?” I cried out while Seth howled in 
anguish. 



602 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“We’re fine. We’re going to be okay,” Edward gasped. 
“Sam — help him — ” 

And I realized in that instant, when he said Sam’s 
name, that he was not speaking of himself and Seth. 
No unseen force was attacking them. This time, the 
crisis was not here. 

He was using the pack plural. 

I’d burned through all my adrenaline. My body had 
nothing left. I sagged, and Edward caught me before I 
could hit the rocks. He sprang to his feet, me in his 
arms. 

“Seth!” Edward shouted. 

Seth was crouched, still tensed in agony, looking as if 
he meant to launch himself into the forest. 

“No!” Edward ordered. “You go straight home. Now. As 
fast as you can!” 

Seth whimpered, shaking his great head from side to 
side. 

“Seth. Trust me.” 

The huge wolf stared into Edward’s agonized eyes for 
one long second, and then he straightened up and 
flew into the trees, disappearing like a ghost. 

Edward cradled me tightly against his chest, and then 
we were also hurtling through the shadowy forest, 
taking a different path than the wolf. 

“Edward.” I fought to force the words through my 
constricted throat. “What happened, Edward? What 



603 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




happened to Sam? Where are we going? What’s 
happening?” 

“We have to go back to the clearing,” he told me in a 
low voice. “We knew there was a good probability of 
this happening. Earlier this morning, Alice saw it and 
passed it through Sam to Seth. The Volturi decided it 
was time to intercede.” 

The Volturi. 

Too much. My mind refused to make sense of the 
words, pretended it couldn’t understand. 

The trees jolted past us. He was running downhill so 
fast that it felt as if we were plummeting, falling out of 
control. 

“Don’t panic. They aren’t coming for us. It’s just the 
normal contingent of the guard that usually cleans up 
this kind of mess. Nothing momentous, they’re merely 
doing their job. Of course, they seem to have timed 
their arrival very carefully. Which leads me to believe 
that no one in Italy would mourn if these newborns 
had reduced the size of the Cullen family.” The words 
came through his teeth, hard and bleak. “I’ll know for 
sure what they were thinking when they get to the 
clearing.” 

“Is that why we’re going back?” I whispered. Could I 
handle this? Images of flowing black robes crept into 
my unwilling mind, and I flinched away from them. I 
was close to a breaking point. 

“It’s part of the reason. Mostly, it will be safer for us 
to present a united front at this point. They have no 
reason to harass us, but ... Jane’s with them. If she 
thought we were alone somewhere away from the 
others, it might tempt her. Like Victoria, Jane will 
604 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




probably guess that I’m with you. Demetri, of course, 
is with her. He could find me, if Jane asked him to.” 

I didn’t want to think that name. I didn’t want to see 
that blindingly exquisite, childlike face in my head. A 
strange sound came out of my throat. 

“Shh, Bella, shh. It’s all going to be fine. Alice can see 
that.” 

Alice could see? But . . . then where were the wolves? 
Where was the pack? 

“The pack?” 

“They had to leave quickly. The Volturi do not honor 
truces with werewolves.” 

I could hear my breathing get faster, but I couldn’t 
control it. I started to gasp. 

“I swear they will be fine,” Edward promised me. “The 
Volturi won’t recognize the scent — they won’t realize 
the wolves are here; this isn’t a species they are 
familiar with. The pack will be fine.” 

I couldn’t process his explanation. My concentration 
was ripped to shreds by my fears. We’re going to be 
fine, he had said before ... and Seth, howling in agony 
. . . Edward had avoided my first question, distracted 
me with the Volturi... . 

I was very close to the edge — just clinging by my 
fingertips. 

The trees were a racing blur that flowed around him 
like jade waters. 



605 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“What happened?” I whispered again. “Before. When 
Seth was howling? When you were hurt?” 

Edward hesitated. 

“Edward! Tell me!” 

“It was all over,” he whispered. I could barely hear 
him over the wind his speed created. “The wolves 
didn’t count their half ... they thought they had them 
all. Of course, Alice couldn’t see... .” 

“What happened?!” 

“One of the newborns was hiding. . . . Leah found him 
— she was being stupid, cocky, trying to prove 
something. She engaged him alone... .” 

“Leah,” I repeated, and I was too weak to feel shame 
for the relief that flooded through me. “Is she going to 
be okay?” 

“Leah wasn’t hurt,” Edward mumbled. 

I stared at him for a long second. 

Sam — help him — Edward had gasped. Him, not 
her. 

“We’re almost there,” Edward said, and he stared at a 
fixed point in the sky. 

Automatically, my eyes followed his. There was a dark 
purple cloud hanging low over the trees. A cloud? But 
it was so abnormally sunny... . No, not a cloud — I 
recognized the thick column of smoke, just like the 
one at our campsite. 



606 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Edward,” I said, my voice nearly inaudible. “Edward, 
someone got hurt.” 

I’d heard Seth’s agony, seen the torture in Edward’s 
face. 

“Yes,” he whispered. 

“Who?” I asked, though, of course, I already knew the 
answer. 

Of course I did. Of course. 

The trees were slowing around us as we came to our 
destination. 

It took him a long moment to answer me. 

“Jacob,” he said. 

I was able to nod once. 

“Of course,” I whispered. 

And then I slipped off the edge I was clinging to inside 
my head. 

Everything went black. 

I was first aware of the cool hands touching me. More 
than one pair of hands. Arms holding me, a palm 
curved to fit my cheek, fingers stroking my forehead, 
and more fingers pressed lightly into my wrist. 

Then I was aware of the voices. They were just a 
humming at first, and then they grew in volume and 
clarity like someone was turning up a radio. 



607 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Carlisle — it’s been five minutes.” Edward’s voice, 
anxious. 

“She’ll come around when she’s ready, Edward.” 
Carlisle’s voice, always calm and sure. “She’s had too 
much to deal with today. Let her mind protect itself.” 

But my mind was not protected. It was trapped in the 
knowledge that had not left me, even in 
unconsciousness — the pain that was part of the 
blackness. 

I felt totally disconnected from my body. Like I was 
caged in some small corner of my head, no longer at 
the controls. But I couldn’t do anything about it. I 
couldn’t think. The agony was too strong for that. 
There was no escape from it. 

Jacob. 

No, no, no, no, no ... 

“Alice, how long do we have?” Edward demanded, his 
voice still tense; Carlisle’s soothing words had not 
helped. 

From farther away, Alice’s voice. It was brightly 
chipper. “Another five minutes. And Bella will open 
her eyes in thirty-seven seconds. I wouldn’t doubt 
that she can hear us now.” 

“Bella, honey?” This was Esme’s soft, comforting 
voice. “Can you hear me? You’re safe now, dear.” 

Yes, I was safe. Did that really matter? 

Then cool lips were at my ear, and Edward was 
speaking the words that allowed me to escape from 
the torture that had me caged inside my own head. 

608 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“He’s going to live, Bella. Jacob Black is healing as I 
speak. He’ll be fine.” 

As the pain and dread eased, I found my way back to 
my body. My eyelids fluttered. 

“Oh, Bella,” Edward sighed in relief, and his lips 
touched mine. 

“Edward,” I whispered. 

“Yes, I’m here.” 

I got my lids to open, and I stared into warm gold. 
“Jacob is okay?” I asked. 

“Yes,” he promised. 

I watched his eyes carefully for some sign that he was 
placating me, but they were perfectly clear. 

“I examined him myself,” Carlisle said then; I turned 
my head to find his face, only a few feet away. 
Carlisle’s expression was serious and reassuring at 
the same time. It was impossible to doubt him. “His 
life is not in any danger. He was healing at an 
incredible rate, though his injuries were extensive 
enough that it will still be a few days before he is back 
to normal, even if the rate of repair holds steady. As 
soon as we’re done here, I will do what I can to help 
him. Sam is trying to get him to phase back to his 
human form. That will make treating him easier.” 
Carlisle smiled slightly. “I’ve never been to 
veterinarian school.” 

“What happened to him?” I whispered. “How bad are 
his injuries?” 



609 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Carlisle’s face was serious again. “Another wolf was in 
trouble — ” 

“Leah,” I breathed. 

“Yes. He knocked her out of the way, but he didn’t 
have time to defend himself. The newborn got his 
arms around him. Most of the bones on the right half 
of his body were shattered.” 

I flinched. 

“Sam and Paul got there in time. He was already 
improving when they took him back to La Push.” 

“He’ll be back to normal?” I asked. 

“Yes, Bella. He won’t have any permanent damage.” 

I took a deep breath. 

“Three minutes,” Alice said quietly. 

I struggled, trying to get vertical. Edward realized 
what I was doing and helped me to my feet. 

I stared at the scene in front of me. 

The Cullens stood in a loose semicircle around the 
bonfire. There were hardly any flames visible, just the 
thick, purple-black smoke, hovering like a disease 
against the bright grass. Jasper stood closest to the 
solid-seeming haze, in its shadow so that his skin did 
not glitter brilliantly in the sun the way the others 
did. He had his back to me, his shoulders tense, his 
arms slightly extended. There was something there, in 
his shadow. Something he crouched over with wary 
intensity... . 



610 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I was too numb to feel more than a mild shock when I 
realized what it was. 

There were eight vampires in the clearing. 

The girl was curled into a small ball beside the 
flames, her arms wrapped around her legs. She was 
very young. Younger than me — she looked maybe 
fifteen, dark-haired and slight. Her eyes were focused 
on me, and the irises were a shocking, brilliant red. 
Much brighter than Riley’s, almost glowing. They 
wheeled wildly, out of control. 

Edward saw my bewildered expression. 

“She surrendered,” he told me quietly. “That’s one I’ve 
never seen before. Only Carlisle would think of 
offering. Jasper doesn’t approve.” 

I couldn’t tear my gaze away from the scene beside 
the fire. Jasper was rubbing absently at his left 
forearm. 

“Is Jasper all right?” I whispered. 

“He’s fine. The venom stings.” 

“He was bitten?” I asked, horrified. 

“He was trying to be everywhere at once. Trying to 
make sure Alice had nothing to do, actually.” Edward 
shook his head. “Alice doesn’t need anyone’s help.” 

Alice grimaced toward her true love. “Overprotective 
fool.” 

The young female suddenly threw her head back like 
an animal and wailed shrilly. 



611 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jasper growled at her and she cringed back, but her 
fingers dug into the ground like claws and her head 
whipped back and forth in anguish. Jasper took a 
step toward her, slipping deeper into his crouch. 
Edward moved with overdone casualness, turning our 
bodies so that he was between the girl and me. I 
peeked around his arm to watch the thrashing girl 
and Jasper. 

Carlisle was at Jasper’s side in an instant. He put a 
restraining hand on his most recent son’s arm. 

“Have you changed your mind, young one?” Carlisle 
asked, calm as ever. “We don’t want to destroy you, 
but we will if you can’t control yourself.” 

“How can you stand it?” the girl groaned in a high, 
clear voice. “I want her.” Her bright crimson irises 
focused on Edward, through him, beyond him to me, 
and her nails ripped through the hard soil again. 

“You must stand it,” Carlisle told her gravely. “You 
must exercise control. It is possible, and it is the only 
thing that will save you now.” 

The girl clutched her dirt-encrusted hands around 
her head, yowling quietly. 

“Shouldn’t we move away from her?” I whispered, 
tugging on Edward’s arm. The girl’s lips pulled back 
over her teeth when she heard my voice, her 
expression one of torment. 

“We have to stay here,” Edward murmured. “They are 
coming to the north end of the clearing now.” 

My heart burst into a sprint as I scanned the clearing, 
but I couldn’t see anything past the thick pall of 
smoke. 

612 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




After a second of fruitless searching, my gaze crept 
back to the young female vampire. She was still 
watching me, her eyes half-mad. 

I met the girl’s stare for a long moment. Chin-length 
dark hair framed her face, which was alabaster pale. 

It was hard to tell if her features were beautiful, 
twisted as they were by rage and thirst. The feral red 
eyes were dominant — hard to look away from. She 
glared at me viciously, shuddering and writhing every 
few seconds. 

I stared at her, mesmerized, wondering if I were 
looking into a mirror of my future. 

Then Carlisle and Jasper began to back toward the 
rest of us. Emmett, Rosalie, and Esme all converged 
hastily around where Edward stood with Alice and 
me. A united front, as Edward had said, with me at 
the heart, in the safest place. 

I tore my attention away from the wild girl to search 
for the approaching monsters. 

There was still nothing to see. I glanced at Edward, 
and his eyes were locked straight ahead. I tried to 
follow his gaze, but there was only the smoke — 
dense, oily smoke twisting low to the ground, rising 
lazily, undulating against the grass. 

It billowed forward, darker in the middle. 

“Hmm,” a dead voice murmured from the mist. I 
recognized the apathy at once. 

“Welcome, Jane.” Edward’s tone was coolly courteous. 

The dark shapes came closer, separating themselves 
from the haze, solidifying. I knew it would be Jane in 

613 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




the front — the darkest cloak, almost black, and the 
smallest figure by more than two feet. I could just 
barely make out Jane’s angelic features in the shade 
of the cowl. 

The four gray-shrouded figures hulking behind her 
were also somewhat familiar. I was sure I recognized 
the biggest one, and while I stared, trying to confirm 
my suspicion, Felix looked up. He let his hood fall 
back slightly so that I could see him wink at me and 
smile. Edward was very still at my side, tightly in 
control. 

Jane’s gaze moved slowly across the luminous faces 
of the Cullens and then touched on the newborn girl 
beside the fire; the newborn had her head in her 
hands again. 

“I don’t understand.” Jane’s voice was toneless, but 
not quite as uninterested as before. 

“She has surrendered,” Edward explained, answering 
the confusion in her mind. 

Jane’s dark eyes flashed to his face. “Surrendered?” 

Felix and another shadow exchanged a quick glance. 

Edward shrugged. “Carlisle gave her the option.” 

“There are no options for those who break the rules,” 
Jane said flatly. 

Carlisle spoke then, his voice mild. “That’s in your 
hands. As long as she was willing to halt her attack 
on us, I saw no need to destroy her. She was never 
taught.” 

“That is irrelevant,” Jane insisted. 

614 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“As you wish.” 



Jane stared at Carlisle in consternation. She shook 
her head infinitesimally, and then composed her 
features. 

“Aro hoped that we would get far enough west to see 
you, Carlisle. He sends his regards.” 

Carlisle nodded. “I would appreciate it if you would 
convey mine to him.” 

“Of course.” Jane smiled. Her face was almost too 
lovely when it was animated. She looked back toward 
the smoke. “It appears that you’ve done our work for 
us today ... for the most part.” Her eyes flickered to 
the hostage. “Just out of professional curiosity, how 
many were there? They left quite a wake of 
destruction in Seattle.” 

“Eighteen, including this one,” Carlisle answered. 

Jane’s eyes widened, and she looked at the fire again, 
seeming to reassess the size of it. Felix and the other 
shadow exchanged a longer glance. 

“Eighteen?” she repeated, her voice sounding unsure 
for the first time. 

“All brand-new,” Carlisle said dismissively. “They were 
unskilled.” 

“All?” Her voice turned sharp. “Then who was their 
creator?” 

“Her name was Victoria,” Edward answered, no 
emotion in his voice. 

“Was?” Jane asked. 

615 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Edward inclined his head toward the eastern forest. 
Jane’s eyes snapped up and focused on something far 
in the distance. The other pillar of smoke? I didn’t 
look away to check. 

Jane stared to the east for a long moment, and then 
examined the closer bonfire again. 

“This Victoria — she was in addition to the eighteen 
here?” 

“Yes. She had only one other with her. He was not as 
young as this one here, but no older than a year.” 

“Twenty,” Jane breathed. “Who dealt with the 
creator?” 

“I did,” Edward told her. 

Jane’s eyes narrowed, and she turned to the girl 
beside the fire. 

“You there,” she said, her dead voice harsher than 
before. “Your name.” 

The newborn shot a baleful glare at Jane, her lips 
pressed tightly together. 

Jane smiled back angelically. 

The newborn girl’s answering scream was ear- 
piercing; her body arched stiffly into a distorted, 
unnatural position. I looked away, fighting the urge to 
cover my ears. I gritted my teeth, hoping to control 
my stomach. The screaming intensified. I tried to 
concentrate on Edward’s face, smooth and 
unemotional, but that made me remember when it 
had been Edward under Jane’s torturing gaze, and I 



616 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




felt sicker. I looked at Alice instead, and Esme next to 
her. Their faces were as empty as his. 

Finally, it was quiet. 

“Your name,” Jane said again, her voice inflectionless. 
“Bree,” the girl gasped. 

Jane smiled, and the girl shrieked again. I held my 
breath until the sound of her agony stopped. 

“Shell tell you anything you want to know,” Edward 
said through his teeth. “You don’t have to do that.” 

Jane looked up, sudden humor in her usually dead 
eyes. “Oh, I know,” she said to Edward, grinning at 
him before she turned back to the young vampire, 
Bree. 

“Bree,” Jane said, her voice cold again. “Is his story 
true? Were there twenty of you?” 

The girl lay panting, the side of her face pressed 
against the earth. She spoke quickly. “Nineteen or 
twenty, maybe more, I don’t know!” She cringed, 
terrified that her ignorance might bring on another 
round of torture. “Sara and the one whose name I 
don’t know got in a fight on the way... .” 

“And this Victoria — did she create you?” 

“I don’t know,” she said, flinching again. “Riley never 
said her name. I didn’t see that night ... it was so 
dark, and it hurt... .” Bree shuddered. “He didn’t want 
us to be able to think of her. He said that our 
thoughts weren’t safe... .” 



617 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jane’s eyes flickered to Edward, and then back to the 
girl. 

Victoria had planned this well. If she hadn’t followed 
Edward, there would have been no way to know for 
certain that she was involved... . 

“Tell me about Riley,” Jane said. “Why did he bring 
you here?” 

“Riley told us that we had to destroy the strange 
yellow-eyes here,” Bree babbled quickly and willingly. 
“He said it would be easy. He said that the city was 
theirs, and they were coming to get us. He said once 
they were gone, all the blood would be ours. He gave 
us her scent.” Bree lifted one hand and stabbed a 
finger in my direction. “He said we would know that 
we had the right coven, because she would be with 
them. He said whoever got to her first could have 
her.” 

I heard Edward’s jaw flex beside me. 

“It looks like Riley was wrong about the easy part,” 
Jane noted. 

Bree nodded, seeming relieved that the conversation 
had taken this non-painful course. She sat up 
carefully. “I don’t know what happened. We split up, 
but the others never came. And Riley left us, and he 
didn’t come to help like he promised. And then it was 
so confusing, and everybody was in pieces.” She 
shuddered again. “I was afraid. I wanted to run away. 
That one” — she looked at Carlisle — “said they 
wouldn’t hurt me if I stopped fighting.” 

“Ah, but that wasn’t his gift to offer, young one,” Jane 
murmured, her voice oddly gentle now. “Broken rules 
demand a consequence.” 

618 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Bree stared at her, not comprehending. 



Jane looked at Carlisle. “Are you sure you got all of 
them? The other half that split off?” 

Carlisle’s face was very smooth as he nodded. “We 
split up, too.” 

Jane half-smiled. “I can’t deny that I’m impressed.” 
The big shadows behind her murmured in agreement. 
“I’ve never seen a coven escape this magnitude of 
offensive intact. Do you know what was behind it? It 
seems like extreme behavior, considering the way you 
live here. And why was the girl the key?” Her eyes 
rested unwilling on me for one short second. 

I shivered. 

“Victoria held a grudge against Bella,” Edward told 
her, his voice impassive. 

Jane laughed — the sound was golden, the bubbling 
laugh of a happy child. “This one seems to bring out 
bizarrely strong reactions in our kind,” she observed, 
smiling directly at me, her face beatific. 

Edward stiffened. I looked at him in time to see his 
face turning away, back to Jane. 

“Would you please not do that?” he asked in a tight 
voice. 

Jane laughed again lightly. “Just checking. No harm 
done, apparently.” 

I shivered, deeply grateful that the strange glitch in 
my system — which had protected me from Jane the 
last time we’d met — was still in effect. Edward’s arm 
tightened around me. 

619 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Well, it appears that there’s not much left for us to 
do. Odd,” Jane said, apathy creeping back into her 
voice. “We’re not used to being rendered unnecessary. 
It’s too bad we missed the fight. It sounds like it 
would have been entertaining to watch.” 

“Yes,” Edward answered her quickly, his voice sharp. 
“And you were so close. It’s a shame you didn’t arrive 
just a half hour earlier. Perhaps then you could have 
fulfilled your purpose here.” 

Jane met Edward’s glare with unwavering eyes. “Yes. 
Quite a pity how things turned out, isn’t it?” 

Edward nodded once to himself, his suspicions 
confirmed. 

Jane turned to look at the newborn Bree again, her 
face completely bored. “Felix?” she drawled. 

“Wait,” Edward interjected. 

Jane raised one eyebrow, but Edward was staring at 
Carlisle while he spoke in an urgent voice. “We could 
explain the rules to the young one. She doesn’t seem 
unwilling to learn. She didn’t know what she was 
doing.” 

“Of course,” Carlisle answered. “We would certainly 
be prepared to take responsibility for Bree.” 

Jane’s expression was torn between amusement and 
disbelief. 

“We don’t make exceptions,” she said. “And we don’t 
give second chances. It’s bad for our reputation. 
Which reminds me ...” Suddenly, her eyes were on me 
again, and her cherubic face dimpled. “Caius will be 



620 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




so interested to hear that you’re still human, Bella. 
Perhaps he’ll decide to visit.” 

“The date is set,” Alice told Jane, speaking for the first 
time. “Perhaps we’ll come to visit you in a few 
months.” 

Jane’s smile faded, and she shrugged indifferently, 
never looking at Alice. She turned to face Carlisle. “It 
was nice to meet you, Carlisle — I’d thought Aro was 
exaggerating. Well, until we meet again ...” 

Carlisle nodded, his expression pained. 

“Take care of that, Felix,” Jane said, nodding toward 
Bree, her voice dripping boredom. “I want to go 
home.” 

“Don’t watch,” Edward whispered in my ear. 

I was only too eager to follow his instruction. I’d seen 
more than enough for one day — more than enough 
for one lifetime. I squeezed my eyes tightly together 
and turned my face into Edward’s chest. 

But I could still hear. 

There was a deep, rumbling growl, and then a high- 
pitched keen that was horribly familiar. That sound 
cut off quickly, and then the only sound was a 
sickening crunching and snapping. 

Edward’s hand rubbed anxiously against my 
shoulders. 

“Come,” Jane said, and I looked up in time to see the 
backs of the tall gray cloaks drifting away toward the 
curling smoke. The incense smell was strong again — 
fresh.

ETHICS 



The counter in Alice's bathroom was covered with a 
thousand different products, all claiming to beautify a 
person’s surface. Since everyone in this house was 
both perfect and impermeable, I could only assume 
that she’d bought most of these things with me in 
mind. I read the labels numbly, struck by the waste. 

I was careful never to look in the long mirror. 

Alice combed through my hair with a slow, rhythmic 
motion. 

“That’s enough, Alice,” I said tonelessly. “I want to go 
back to La Push.” 

How many hours had I waited for Charlie to finally 
leave Billy’s house so that I could see Jacob? Each 
minute, not knowing if Jacob was still breathing or 
not, had seemed like ten lifetimes. And then, when at 
last I’d been allowed to go, to see for myself that 
Jacob was alive, the time had gone so quickly. I felt 
like I’d barely caught my breath before Alice was 
calling Edward, insisting that I keep up this 
ridiculous sleepover fagade. It seemed so 
insignificant... . 

“Jacob’s still unconscious,” Alice answered. “Carlisle 
or Edward will call when he’s awake. Anyway, you 
need to go see Charlie. He was there at Billy’s house, 
he saw that Carlisle and Edward are back in from 
their trip, and he’s bound to be suspicious when you 
get home.” 



623 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



I already had my story memorized and corroborated. 

“I don’t care. I want to be there when Jacob wakes 
up.” 

“You need to think of Charlie now. You’ve had a long 
day — sorry, I know that doesn’t begin to cover it — 
but that doesn’t mean that you can shirk your 
responsibilities.” Her voice was serious, almost 
chiding. “It’s more important now than ever that 
Charlie stays safely in the dark. Play your role first, 
Bella, and then you can do what you want second. 
Part of being a Cullen is being meticulously 
responsible.” 

Of course she was right. And if not for this same 
reason — a reason that was more powerful than all 
my fear and pain and guilt — Carlisle would never 
have been able to talk me into leaving Jacob’s side, 
unconscious or not. 

“Go home,” Alice ordered. “Talk to Charlie. Flesh out 
your alibi. Keep him safe.” 

I stood, and the blood flowed down to my feet, 
stinging like the pricks of a thousand needles. I’d 
been sitting still for a long time. 

“That dress is adorable on you,” Alice cooed. 

“Huh? Oh. Er — thanks again for the clothes,” I 
mumbled out of courtesy rather than real gratitude. 

“You need the evidence,” Alice said, her eyes innocent 
and wide. “What’s a shopping trip without a new 
outfit? It’s very flattering, if I do say so myself.” 

I blinked, unable to remember what she’d dressed me 
in. I couldn’t keep my thoughts from skittering away 
every few seconds, insects running from the light... . 

624 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Jacob is fine, Bella,” Alice said, easily interpreting 
my preoccupation. “There’s no hurry. If you realized 
how much extra morphine Carlisle had to give him — 
what with his temperature burning it off so quickly — 
you would know that he’s going to be out for a while.” 

At least he wasn’t in any pain. Not yet. 

“Is there anything you want to talk about before you 
leave?” Alice asked sympathetically. “You must be 
more than a little traumatized.” 

I knew what she was curious about. But I had other 
questions. 

“Will I be like that?” I asked her, my voice subdued. 
“Like that girl Bree in the meadow?” 

There were many things I needed to think of, but I 
couldn’t seem to get her out of my head, the newborn 
whose other life was now — abruptly — over. Her 
face, twisted with desire for my blood, lingered behind 
my eyelids. 

Alice stroked my arm. “Everyone is different. But 
something like that, yes.” 

I was very still, trying to imagine. 

“It passes,” she promised. 

“How soon?” 

She shrugged. “A few years, maybe less. It might be 
different for you. I’ve never seen anyone go through 
this who’s chosen it beforehand. It should be 
interesting to see how that affects you.” 

“Interesting,” I repeated. 

625 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Well keep you out of trouble.” 



“I know that. I trust you.” My voice was monotone, 
dead. 

Alice’s forehead puckered. “If you’re worried about 
Carlisle and Edward, I’m sure they’ll be fine. I believe 
Sam is beginning to trust us ... well, to trust Carlisle, 
at least. It’s a good thing, too. I imagine the 
atmosphere got a little tense when Carlisle had to 
rebreak the fractures — ” 

“Please, Alice.” 

“Sorry.” 

I took a deep breath to steady myself. Jacob had 
begun healing too quickly, and some of his bones had 
set wrong. He’d been out cold for the process, but it 
was still hard to think about. 

“Alice, can I ask you a question? About the future?” 

She was suddenly wary. “You know I don’t see 
everything.” 

“It’s not that, exactly. But you do see my future, 
sometimes. Why is that, do you think, when nothing 
else works on me? Not what Jane can do, or Edward 
or Aro ...” My sentence trailed off with my interest 
level. My curiosity on this point was fleeting, heavily 
overshadowed by more pressing emotions. 

Alice, however, found the question very interesting. 
“Jasper, too, Bella — his talent works on your body 
just as well as it does on anyone else’s. That’s the 
difference, do you see it? Jasper’s abilities affect the 
body physically. He really does calm your system 
down, or excite it. It’s not an illusion. And I see 
626 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




visions of outcomes, not the reasons and thoughts 
behind the decisions that create them. It’s outside the 
mind, not an illusion, either; reality, or at least one 
version of it. But Jane and Edward and Aro and 
Demetri — they work inside the mind. Jane only 
creates an illusion of pain. She doesn’t really hurt 
your body, you only think you feel it. You see, Bella? 
You are safe inside your mind. No one can reach you 
there. It’s no wonder that Aro was so curious about 
your future abilities.” 

She watched my face to see if I was following her 
logic. In truth, her words had all started to run 
together, the syllables and sounds losing their 
meaning. I couldn’t concentrate on them. Still, I 
nodded. Trying to look like I got it. 

She wasn’t fooled. She stroked my cheek and 
murmured, “He’s going to be okay, Bella. I don’t need 
a vision to know that. Are you ready to go?” 

“One more thing. Can I ask you another question 
about the future? I don’t want specifics, just an 
overview.” 

“I’ll do my best,” she said, doubtful again. 

“Can you still see me becoming a vampire?” 

“Oh, that’s easy. Sure, I do.” 

I nodded slowly. 

She examined my face, her eyes unfathomable. “Don’t 
you know your own mind, Bella?” 

“I do. I just wanted to be sure.” 



627 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




‘Tm only as sure as you are, Bella. You know that. If 
you were to change your mind, what I see would 
change ... or disappear, in your case.” 

I sighed. “That isn’t going to happen, though.” 

She put her arms around me. “I’m sorry. I can’t really 
empathize. My first memory is of seeing Jasper’s face 
in my future; I always knew that he was where my life 
was headed. But I can sympathize. I’m so sorry you 
have to choose between two good things.” 

I shook off her arms. “Don’t feel sorry for me.” There 
were people who deserved sympathy. I wasn’t one of 
them. And there wasn’t any choice to make — there 
was just breaking a good heart to attend to now. “I’ll 
go deal with Charlie.” 

I drove my truck home, where Charlie was waiting 
just as suspiciously as Alice had expected. 

“Hey, Bella. How was your shopping trip?” he greeted 
me when I walked into the kitchen. He had his arms 
folded over his chest, his eyes on my face. 

“Long,” I said dully. “We just got back.” 

Charlie assessed my mood. “I guess you already 
heard about Jake, then?” 

“Yes. The rest of the Cullens beat us home. Esme told 
us where Carlisle and Edward were.” 

“Are you okay?” 

“Worried about Jake. As soon as I make dinner, I’m 
going down to La Push.” 



628 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I told you those motorcycles were dangerous. I hope 
this makes you realize that I wasn’t kidding around.” 

I nodded as I started pulling things out of the fridge. 
Charlie settled himself in at the table. He seemed to 
be in a more talkative mood than usual. 

“I don’t think you need to worry about Jake too much. 
Anyone who can cuss with that kind of energy is 
going to recover.” 

“Jake was awake when you saw him?” I asked, 
spinning to look at him. 

“Oh, yeah, he was awake. You should have heard him 
— actually, it’s better you didn’t. I don’t think there 
was anyone in La Push who couldn’t hear him. I don’t 
know where he picked up that vocabulary, but I hope 
he hasn’t been using that kind of language around 
you.” 

“He had a pretty good excuse today. How did he 
look?” 

“Messed up. His friends carried him in. Good thing 
they’re big boys, ’cause that kid’s an armful. Carlisle 
said his right leg is broken, and his right arm. Pretty 
much the whole right side of his body got crushed 
when he wrecked that damn bike.” Charlie shook his 
head. “If I ever hear of you riding again, Bella — ” 

“No problem there, Dad. You won’t. Do you really 
think Jake’s okay?” 

“Sure, Bella, don’t worry. He was himself enough to 
tease me.” 

“Tease you?” I echoed in shock. 



629 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Yeah — in between insulting somebody’s mother and 
taking the Lord’s name in vain, he said, ‘Bet you’re 
glad she loves Cullen instead of me today, huh, 
Charlie?”’ 

I turned back to the fridge so that he couldn’t see my 
face. 

“And I couldn’t argue. Edward’s more mature than 
Jacob when it comes to your safety, I’ll give him that 
much.” 

“Jacob’s plenty mature,” I muttered defensively. “I’m 
sure this wasn’t his fault.” 

“Weird day today,” Charlie mused after a minute. 

“You know, I don’t put much stock in that 
superstitious crap, but it was odd... . It was like Billy 
knew something bad was going to happen to Jake. He 
was nervous as a turkey on Thanksgiving all morning. 
I don’t think he heard anything I said to him. 

“And then, weirder than that — remember back in 
February and March when we had all that trouble 
with the wolves?” 

I bent down to get a frying pan out of the cupboard, 
and hid there an extra second or two. 

“Yeah,” I mumbled. 

“I hope we’re not going to have a problem with that 
again. This morning, we were out in the boat, and 
Billy wasn’t paying any attention to me or the fish, 
when all of a sudden, you could hear wolves yowling 
in the woods. More than one, and, boy, was it loud. 
Sounded like they were right there in the village. 
Weirdest part was, Billy turned the boat around and 
headed straight back to the harbor like they were 
630 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




calling to him personally. Didn’t even hear me ask 
what he was doing. 



“The noise stopped before we got the boat docked. But 
all of a sudden Billy was in the biggest hurry not to 
miss the game, though we had hours still. He was 
mumbling some nonsense about an earlier showing ... 
of a live game? I tell you, Bella, it was odd. 

“Well, he found some game he said he wanted to 
watch, but then he just ignored it. He was on the 
phone the whole time, calling Sue, and Emily, and 
your friend Quil’s grandpa. Couldn’t quite make out 
what he was looking for — he just chatted real casual 
with them. 

“Then the howling started again right outside the 
house. I’ve never heard anything like it — I had goose 
bumps on my arms. I asked Billy — had to shout over 
the noise — if he’d been setting traps in his yard. It 
sounded like the animal was in serious pain.” 

I winced, but Charlie was so caught up in his story 
that he didn’t notice. 

“’Course I forgot all about that till just this minute, 
’cause that’s when Jake made it home. One minute it 
was that wolf yowling, and then you couldn’t hear it 
anymore — Jake’s cussing drowned it right out. Got a 
set of lungs on him, that boy does.” 

Charlie paused for a minute, his face thoughtful. 
“Funny that some good should come out of this mess. 

I didn’t think they were ever going to get over that fool 
prejudice they have against the Cullens down there. 
But somebody called Carlisle, and Billy was real 
grateful when he showed up. I thought we should get 
Jake up to the hospital, but Billy wanted to keep him 
home, and Carlisle agreed. I guess Carlisle knows 
631 | P a g e Eclipse -Stephanie Meyer 




what’s best. Generous of him to sign up for such a 
long stretch of house calls.” 

“And ...” he paused, as if unwilling to say something. 
He sighed, and then continued. “And Edward was 
really ... nice. He seemed as worried about Jacob as 
you are — like that was his brother lying there. The 
look in his eyes ...” Charlie shook his head. “He’s a 
decent guy, Bella. I’ll try to remember that. No 
promises, though.” He grinned at me. 

“I won’t hold you to it,” I mumbled. 

Charlie stretched his legs and groaned. “It’s nice to be 
home. You wouldn’t believe how crowded Billy’s little 
place gets. Seven of Jake’s friends all squished 
themselves into that little front room — I could hardly 
breathe. Have you ever noticed how big those 
Quileute kids all are?” 

“Yeah, I have.” 

Charlie stared at me, his eyes abruptly more focused. 
“Really, Bella, Carlisle said Jake will be up and 
around in no time. Said it looked a lot worse than it 
was. He’s going to be fine.” 

I just nodded. 

Jacob had looked so ... strangely fragile when I’d 
hurried down to see him as soon as Charlie had left. 
He’d had braces everywhere — Carlisle said there was 
no point in plaster, as fast as he was healing. His face 
had been pale and drawn, deeply unconscious though 
he was at the time. Breakable. Huge as he was, he’d 
looked very breakable. Maybe that had just been my 
imagination, coupled with the knowledge that I was 
going to have to break him. 



632 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




If only I could be struck by lightning and be split in 
two. Preferably painfully. For the first time, giving up 
being human felt like a true sacrifice. Like it might be 
too much to lose. 

I put Charlie’s dinner on the table next to his elbow 
and headed for the door. 

“Er, Bella? Could you wait just a second?” 

“Did I forget something?” I asked, eyeing his plate. 

“No, no. I just ... want to ask a favor.” Charlie frowned 
and looked at the floor. “Have a seat — this won’t take 
long.” 

I sat across from him, a little confused. I tried to 
focus. “What do you need, Dad?” 

“Here’s the gist of it, Bella.” Charlie flushed. “Maybe 
I’m just feeling ... superstitious after hanging out with 
Billy while he was being so strange all day. But I have 
this ... hunch. I feel like ... I’m going to lose you 
soon.” 

“Don’t be silly, Dad,” I mumbled guiltily. “You want 
me to go to school, don’t you?” 

“Just promise me one thing.” 

I was hesitant, ready to rescind. “Okay ...” 

“Will you tell me before you do anything major? 

Before you run off with him or something?” 

“Dad ... ,” I moaned. 



633 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




‘Tm serious. I won’t kick up a fuss. Just give me 
some advance notice. Give me a chance to hug you 
goodbye.” 

Cringing mentally, I held up my hand. “This is silly. 
But, if it makes you happy, ... I promise.” 

“Thanks, Bella,” he said. “I love you, kid.” 

“I love you, too, Dad.” I touched his shoulder, and 
then shoved away from the table. “If you need 
anything, I’ll be at Billy’s.” 

I didn’t look back as I ran out. This was just perfect, 
just what I needed right now. I grumbled to myself all 
the way to La Push. 

Carlisle’s black Mercedes was not in front of Billy’s 
house. That was both good and bad. Obviously, I 
needed to talk to Jacob alone. Yet I still wished I 
could somehow hold Edward’s hand, like I had before, 
when Jacob was unconscious. Impossible. But I 
missed Edward — it had seemed like a very long 
afternoon alone with Alice. I supposed that made my 
answer quite obvious. I already knew that I couldn’t 
live without Edward. That fact wasn’t going to make 
this any less painful. 

I tapped quietly on the front door. 

“Come in, Bella,” Billy said. The roar of my truck was 
easy to recognize. 

I let myself in. 

“Hey, Billy. Is he awake?” I asked. 



634 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“He woke up about a half hour ago, just before the 
doctor left. Go on in. I think he’s been waiting for 
you.” 

I flinched, and then took a deep breath. “Thanks.” 

I hesitated at the door to Jacob’s room, not sure 
whether to knock. I decided to peek first, hoping — 
coward that I was — that maybe he’d gone back to 
sleep. I felt like I could use just a few more minutes. 

I opened the door a crack and leaned hesitantly in. 

Jacob was waiting for me, his face calm and smooth. 
The haggard, gaunt look was gone, but only a careful 
blankness took its place. There was no animation in 
his dark eyes. 

It was hard to look at his face, knowing that I loved 
him. It made more of a difference than I would have 
thought. I wondered if it had always been this hard 
for him, all this time. 

Thankfully, someone had covered him with a quilt. It 
was a relief not to have to see the extent of the 
damage. 

I stepped in and shut the door quietly behind me. 

“Hi, Jake,” I murmured. 

He didn’t answer at first. He looked at my face for a 
long moment. Then, with some effort, he rearranged 
his expression into a slightly mocking smile. 

“Yeah, I sort of thought it might be like that.” He 
sighed. “Today has definitely taken a turn for the 
worse. First I pick the wrong place, miss the best 
fight, and Seth gets all the glory. Then Leah has to be 

635 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




an idiot trying to prove she’s as tough as the rest of 
us and I have to be the idiot who saves her. And now 
this.” He waved his left hand toward me where I 
hesitated by the door. 

“How are you feeling?” I mumbled. What a stupid 
question. 

“A little stoned. Dr. Fang isn’t sure how much pain 
medication I need, so he’s going with trial and error. 
Think he overdid it.” 

“But you’re not in pain.” 

“No. At least, I can’t feel my injuries,” he said, smiling 
mockingly again. 

I bit my lip. I was never going to get through this. 

Why didn’t anyone ever try to kill me when I wanted 
to die? 

The wry humor left his face, and his eyes warmed up. 
His forehead creased, like he was worried. 

“How about you?” he asked, sounding really 
concerned. “Are you okay?” 

“Me?” I stared at him. Maybe he had taken too many 
drugs. “Why?” 

“Well, I mean, I was pretty sure that he wouldn’t 
actually hurt you, but I wasn’t sure how bad it was 
going to be. I’ve been going a little crazy with worrying 
about you ever since I woke up. I didn’t know if you 
were going to be allowed to visit or anything. The 
suspense was terrible. How did it go? Was he mean to 
you? I’m sorry if it was bad. I didn’t mean for you to 
have to go through that alone. I was thinking I’d be 
there... .” 

636 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




It took me a minute to even understand. He babbled 
on, looking more and more awkward, until I got what 
he was saying. Then I hurried to reassure him. 

“No, no, Jake! I’m fine. Too fine, really. Of course he 
wasn’t mean. I wish!” 

His eyes widened in what looked like horror. “What?” 

“He wasn’t even mad at me — he wasn’t even mad at 
you! He’s so unselfish it makes me feel even worse. I 
wish he would have yelled at me or something. It’s not 
like I don’t deserve ... well, much worse that getting 
yelled at. But he doesn’t care. He just wants me to be 
happy.” 

“He wasn’t mad?” Jacob asked, incredulous. 

“No. He was ... much too kind.” 

Jacob stared for another minute, and then he 
suddenly frowned. “Well, damn!” he growled. 

“What’s wrong, Jake? Does it hurt?” My hands 
fluttered uselessly as I looked around for his 
medication. 

“No,” he grumbled in a disgusted tone. “I can’t believe 
this! He didn’t give you an ultimatum or anything?” 

“Not even close — what’s wrong with you?” 

He scowled and shook his head. “I was sort of 
counting on his reaction. Damn it all. He’s better than 
I thought.” 

The way he said it, though angrier, reminded me of 
Edward’s tribute to Jacob’s lack of ethics in the tent 



637 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




this morning. Which meant that Jake was still 
hoping, still fighting. I winced as that stabbed deep. 

“He’s not playing any game, Jake,” I said quietly. 

“You bet he is. He’s playing every bit as hard as I am, 
only he knows what he’s doing and I don’t. Don’t 
blame me because he’s a better manipulator than I 
am — I haven’t been around long enough to learn all 
his tricks.” 

“He isn’t manipulating me!” 

“Yes, he is! When are you going to wake up and 
realize that he’s not a perfect as you think he is?” 

“At least he didn’t threaten to kill himself to make me 
kiss him,” I snapped. As soon as the words were out, I 
flushed with chagrin. “Wait. Pretend that didn’t slip 
out. I swore to myself that I wasn’t going to say 
anything about that.” 

He took a deep breath. When he spoke, he was 
calmer. “Why not?” 

“Because I didn’t come here to blame you for 
anything.” 

“It’s true, though,” he said evenly. “I did do that.” 

“I don’t care, Jake. I’m not mad.” 

He smiled. “I don’t care, either. I knew you’d forgive 
me, and I’m glad I did it. I’d do it again. At least I have 
that much. At least I made you see that you do love 
me. That’s worth something.” 

“Is it? Is it really better than if I was still in the dark?” 



638 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Don’t you think you ought to know how you feel — 
just so that it doesn’t take you by surprise someday 
when it’s too late and you’re a married vampire?” 

I shook my head. “No — I didn’t mean better for me. I 
meant better for you. Does it make things better or 
worse for you, having me know that I’m in love with 
you? When it doesn’t make a difference either way. 
Would it have been better, easier for you, if I never 
clued in?” 

He took my question as seriously as I’d meant it, 
thinking carefully before he answered. “Yes, it’s better 
to have you know,” he finally decided. “If you hadn’t 
figured it out ... I’d have always wondered if your 
decision would have been different if you had. Now I 
know. I did everything I could.” He dragged in an 
unsteady breath, and closed his eyes. 

This time I did not — could not — resist the urge to 
comfort him. I crossed the small room and kneeled by 
his head, afraid to sit on the bed in case I jostled it 
and hurt him, and leaned in to touch my forehead to 
his cheek. 

Jacob sighed, and put his hand on my hair, holding 
me there. 

“I’m so sorry, Jake.” 

“I always knew this was a long shot. It’s not your 
fault, Bella.” 

“Not you, too,” I moaned. “Please.” 

He pulled away to look at me. “What?” 

“It is my fault. And I’m so sick of being told it’s not.” 



639 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He grinned. It didn’t touch his eyes. “You want me to 
haul you over the coals?” 



“Actually ... I think I do.” 

He pursed his lips as he measured how much I meant 
it. A smile flashed across his face briefly, and then he 
twisted his expression into a fierce scowl. 

“Kissing me back like that was inexcusable.” He spit 
the words at me. “If you knew you were just going to 
take it back, maybe you shouldn’t have been quite so 
convincing about it.” 

I winced and nodded. “I’m so sorry.” 

“Sorry doesn’t make anything better, Bella. What were 
you thinking?” 

“I wasn’t,” I whispered. 

“You should have told me to go die. That’s what you 
want.” 

“No, Jacob,” I whimpered, fighting against the 
budding tears. “No! Never.” 

“You’re not crying?” he demanded, his voice suddenly 
back to its normal tone. He twitched impatiently on 
the bed. 

“Yeah,” I muttered, laughing weakly at myself through 
the tears that were suddenly sobs. 

He shifted his weight, throwing his good leg off the 
bed as if he were going to try to stand. 

“What are you doing?” I demanded through the tears. 
“Lie down, you idiot, you’ll hurt yourself!” I jumped to 

640 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




my feet and pushed his good shoulder down with two 
hands. 



He surrendered, leaning back with a gasp of pain, but 
he grabbed me around my waist and pulled me down 
on the bed, against his good side. I curled up there, 
trying to stifle the silly sobs against his hot skin. 

“I can’t believe you’re crying,” he mumbled. “You 
know I just said those things because you wanted me 
to. I didn’t mean them.” His hand rubbed against my 
shoulders. 

“I know.” I took a deep, ragged breath, trying to 
control myself. How did I end up being the one crying 
while he did the comforting? “It’s all still true, though. 
Thanks for saying it out loud.” 

“Do I get points for making you cry?” 

“Sure, Jake.” I tried to smile. “As many as you want.” 

“Don’t worry, Bella, honey. It’s all going to work out.” 

“I don’t see how,” I muttered. 

He patted the top of my head. “I’m going to give in 
and be good.” 

“More games?” I wondered, tilting my chin so that I 
could see his face. 

“Maybe.” He laughed with a bit of effort, and then 
winced. “But I’m going to try.” 

I frowned. 

“Don’t be so pessimistic,” he complained. “Give me a 
little credit.”

“What do you mean by he good’?” 

“I’ll be your friend, Bella,” he said quietly. “I won’t ask 
for more than that.” 

“I think it’s too late for that, Jake. How can we be 
friends, when we love each other like this?” 

He looked at the ceiling, his stare intent, as if he were 
reading something that was written there. “Maybe ... 
it will have to be a long-distance friendship.” 

I clenched my teeth together, glad he wasn’t looking 
at my face, fighting against the sobs that threatened 
to overtake me again. I needed to be strong, and I had 
no idea how... . 

“You know that story in the Bible?” Jacob asked 
suddenly, still reading the blank ceiling. “The one 
with the king and the two women fighting over the 
baby?” 

“Sure. King Solomon.” 

“That’s right. King Solomon,” he repeated. “And he 
said, cut the kid in half ... but it was only a test. Just 
to see who would give up their share to protect it.” 

“Yeah, I remember.” 

He looked back at my face. “I’m not going to cut you 
in half anymore, Bella.” 

I understood what he was saying. He was telling me 
that he loved me the most, that his surrender proved 
it. I wanted to defend Edward, to tell Jacob how 
Edward would do the same thing if I wanted, if I 
would let him. I was the one who wouldn’t renounce 



642 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




my claim there. But there was no point in starting an 
argument that would only hurt him more. 

I closed my eyes, willing myself to control the pain. I 
couldn’t impose that on him. 

We were quiet for a moment. He seemed to be waiting 
for me to say something; I was trying to think of 
something to say. 

“Can I tell you what the worst part is?” he asked 
hesitantly when I said nothing. “Do you mind? I am 
going to be good.” 

“Will it help?” I whispered. 

“It might. It couldn’t hurt.” 

“What’s the worst part, then?” 

“The worse part is knowing what would have been.” 
“What might have been.” I sighed. 

“No.” Jacob shook his head. “I’m exactly right for you, 
Bella. It would have been effortless for us — 
comfortable, easy as breathing. I was the natural path 
your life would have taken... .” He stared into space 
for a moment, and I waited. “If the world was the way 
it was supposed to be, if there were no monsters and 
no magic ...” 

I could see what he saw, and I knew that he was 
right. If the world was the sane place it was supposed 
to be, Jacob and I would have been together. And we 
would have been happy. He was my soul mate in that 
world — would have been my soul mate still if his 
claim had not been overshadowed by something 



643 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




stronger, something so strong that it could not exist 
in a rational world. 

Was it out there for Jacob, too? Something that would 
trump a soul mate? I had to believe that it was. 

Two futures, two soul mates ... too much for any one 
person. And so unfair that I wouldn’t be the only one 
to pay for it. Jacob’s pain seemed too high a price. 
Cringing at the thought of that price, I wondered if I 
would have wavered, if I hadn’t lost Edward once. If I 
didn’t know what it was like to live without him. I 
wasn’t sure. That knowledge was so deep a part of 
me, I couldn’t imagine how I would feel without it. 

“He’s like a drug for you, Bella.” His voice was still 
gentle, not at all critical. “I see that you can’t live 
without him now. It’s too late. But I would have been 
healthier for you. Not a drug; I would have been the 
air, the sun.” 

The corner of my mouth turned up in a wistful half- 
smile. “I used to think of you that way, you know. 

Like the sun. My personal sun. You balanced out the 
clouds nicely for me.” 

He sighed. “The clouds I can handle. But I can’t fight 
with an eclipse.” 

I touched his face, laying my hand against his cheek. 
He exhaled at my touch and closed his eyes. It was 
very quiet. For a minute I could hear the beating of 
his heart, slow and even. 

“Tell me the worst part for you,” he whispered. 

“I think that might be a bad idea.” 

“Please.” 

644 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I think it will hurt.” 



“Please.” 

How could I deny him anything at this point? 

“The worst part ...” I hesitated, and then let words 
spill out in a flood of truth. “The worst part is that I 
saw the whole thing — our whole life. And I want it 
bad, Jake, I want it all. I want to stay right here and 
never move. I want to love you and make you happy. 
And I can’t, and it’s killing me. It’s like Sam and 
Emily, Jake — I never had a choice. I always knew 
nothing would change. Maybe that’s why I was 
fighting against you so hard.” 

He seemed to be concentrating on breathing evenly. 

“I knew I shouldn’t have told you that.” 

He shook his head slowly. “No. I’m glad you did. 
Thank you.” He kissed the top of my head, and then 
he sighed. “I’ll be good now.” 

I looked up, and he was smiling. 

“So you’re going to get married, huh?” 

“We don’t have to talk about that.” 

“I’d like to know some of the details. I don’t know 
when I’ll talk to you again.” 

I had to wait for a minute before I could speak. When 
I was pretty sure that my voice wouldn’t break, I 
answered his question. 

“It’s not really my idea ... but, yes. It means a lot to 
him. I figure, why not?” 

645 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Jake nodded. “That’s true. It’s not such a big thing — 
in comparison.” 

His voice was very calm, very practical. I stared at 
him, curious about how he was managing, and that 
ruined it. He met my eyes for a second, and then 
twisted his head away. I waited to speak until his 
breathing was under control. 

“Yes. In comparison,” I agreed. 

“How long do you have left?” 

“That depends on how long it takes Alice to pull a 
wedding together.” I suppressed a groan, imagining 
what Alice would do. 

“Before or after?” he asked quietly. 

I knew what he meant. “After.” 

He nodded. This was a relief to him. I wondered how 
many sleepless nights the thought of my graduation 
had given him. 

“Are you scared?” he whispered. 

“Yes,” I whispered back. 

“What are you afraid of?” I could barely hear his voice 
now. He stared down at my hands. 

“Lots of things.” I worked to make my voice lighter, 
but I stayed honest. “I’ve never been much of a 
masochist, so I’m not looking forward to the pain. 

And I wish there was some way to keep him away — I 
don’t want him to suffer with me, but I don’t think 
there’s any way around it. There’s dealing with 
Charlie, too, and Renee... . And then afterward, I hope 
646 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I’ll be able to control myself soon. Maybe I’ll be such a 
menace that the pack will have to take me out.” 

He looked up with a disapproving expression. “I’d 
hamstring any one of my brothers who tried.” 

“Thanks.” 

He smiled halfheartedly. Then he frowned. “But isn’t 
it more dangerous than that? In all of the stories, they 
say it’s too hard ... they lose control ... people die... .” 
He gulped. 

“No, I’m not afraid of that. Silly Jacob — don’t you 
know better than to believe vampire stories?” 

He obviously didn’t appreciate my attempt at humor. 

“Well, anyway, lots to worry about. But worth it, in 
the end.” 

He nodded unwillingly, and I knew that he in no way 
agreed with me. 

I stretched my neck up to whisper in his ear, laying 
my cheek against his warm skin. “You know I love 
you.” 

“I know,” he breathed, his arm tightening 
automatically around my waist. “You know how much 
I wish it was enough.” 

“Yes.” 

“I’ll always be waiting in the wings, Bella,” he 
promised, lightening his tone and loosening his arm. I 
pulled away with a dull, dragging sense of loss, feeling 
the tearing separation as I left a part of me behind,

there on the bed next to him. “You’ll always have that 
spare option if you want it.” 

I made an effort to smile. “Until my heart stops 
beating.” 

He grinned back. “You know, I think maybe I’d still 
take you — maybe. I guess that depends on how 
much you stink.” 

“Should I come back to see you? Or would you rather 
I didn’t?” 

“I’ll think it through and get back to you,” he said. “I 
might need the company to keep from going crazy. 

The vampire surgeon extraordinaire says I can’t phase 
until he gives the okay — it might mess up the way 
the bones are set.” Jacob made a face. 

“Be good and do what Carlisle tells you to do. You’ll 
get well faster.” 

“Sure, sure.” 

“I wonder when it will happen,” I said. “When the 
right girl is going to catch your eye.” 

“Don’t get your hopes up, Bella.” Jacob’s voice was 
abruptly sour. “Though I’m sure it would be a relief 
for you.” 

“Maybe, maybe not. I probably won’t think she’s good 
enough for you. I wonder how jealous I’ll be.” 

“That part might be kind of fun,” he admitted. 

“Let me know if you want me to come back, and I’ll be 
here,” I promised. 



648 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




With a sigh, he turned his cheek toward me. 

I leaned in and kissed his face softly. “Love you, 
Jacob.” 

He laughed lightly. “Love you more.” 

He watched me walk out of his room with an 
unfathomable expression in his black eyes. 



649 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 





I didn't get very far before driving became impossible. 

When I couldn’t see anymore, I let my tires find the 
rough shoulder and rolled slowly to a stop. I slumped 
over on the seat and allowed the weakness I’d fought 
in Jacob’s room crush me. It was worse that I’d 
thought — the force of it took me by surprise. Yes, I 
had been right to hide this from Jacob. No one should 
ever see this. 

But I wasn’t alone for very long — just exactly long 
enough for Alice to see me here, and then the few 
minutes it took him to arrive. The door creaked open, 
and he pulled me into his arms. 

At first it was worse. Because there was that smaller 
part of me — smaller, but getting louder and angrier 
every minute, screaming at the rest of me — that 
craved a different set of arms. So then there was fresh 
guilt to season the pain. 

He didn’t say anything, he just let me sob until I 
began to blubber out Charlie’s name. 

“Are you really ready to go home?” he asked 
doubtfully. 

I managed to convey, after several attempts, that it 
wasn’t going to get any better anytime soon. I needed 
to get past Charlie before it got late enough for him to 
call Billy. 

So he drove me home — for once not even getting 
close to my truck’s internal speed limit — keeping one 

650 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



arm wrapped tightly around me. The whole way, I 
fought for control. It seemed to be a doomed effort at 
first, but I didn’t give up. Just a few seconds, I told 
myself. Just time for a few excuses, or a few lies, and 
then I could break down again. I had to be able to do 
that much. I scrambled around in my head, searching 
desperately for a reserve of strength. 

There was just enough for me to quiet the sobs — 
hold them back but not end them. The tears didn’t 
slow. I couldn’t seem to find any handle to even begin 
to work with those. 

“Wait for me upstairs,” I mumbled when we were in 
front of the house. 

He hugged me closer for one minute, and then he was 
gone. 

Once inside, I headed straight for the stairs. 

“Bella?” Charlie called after me from his usual place 
on the sofa as I walked by. 

I turned to look at him without speaking. His eyes 
bugged wide, and he lurched to his feet. 

“What happened? Is Jacob ... ?” he demanded. 

I shook my head furiously, trying to find my voice. 
“He’s fine, he’s fine,” I promised, my voice low and 
husky. And Jacob was fine, physically, which is all 
Charlie was worried about at the moment. 

“But what happened?” He grabbed my shoulders, his 
eyes still anxious and wide. “What happened to you?” 

I must look worse than I’d imagined. 



651 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Nothing, Dad. I ... just had to talk to Jacob about ... 
some things that were hard. I’m fine.” 

The anxiety calmed, and was replaced by disapproval. 

“Was this really the best time?” he asked. 

“Probably not, Dad, but I didn’t have any alternatives 
— it just got to the point where I had to choose... . 
Sometimes, there isn’t any way to compromise.” 

He shook his head slowly. “How did he handle it?” 

I didn’t answer. 

He looked at my face for a minute, and then nodded. 
That must have been answer enough. 

“I hope you didn’t mess up his recovery.” 

“He’s a quick healer,” I mumbled. 

Charlie sighed. 

I could feel the control slipping. 

“I’ll be in my room,” I told him, shrugging out from 
underneath his hands. 

“’Kay,” Charlie agreed. He could probably see the 
waterworks starting to escalate. Nothing scared 
Charlie worse than tears. 

I made my way to my room, blind and stumbling. 

Once inside, I fought with the clasp on my bracelet, 
trying to undo it with shaking fingers. 



652 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“No, Bella,” Edward whispered, capturing my hands. 
“It’s part of who you are.” 

He pulled me into the cradle of his arms as the sobs 
broke free again. 

This longest of days seemed to stretch on and on and 
on. I wondered if it would ever end. 

But, though the night dragged relentlessly, it was not 
the worst night of my life. I took comfort from that. 
And I was not alone. There was a great deal of comfort 
in that, too. 

Charlie’s fear of emotional outbursts kept him from 
checking on me, though I was not quiet — he 
probably got no more sleep than I did. 

My hindsight seemed unbearably clear tonight. I 
could see every mistake I’d made, every bit of harm I’d 
done, the small things and the big things. Each pain 
I’d caused Jacob, each wound I’d given Edward, 
stacked up into neat piles that I could not ignore or 
deny. 

And I realized that I’d been wrong all along about the 
magnets. It had not been Edward and Jacob that I’d 
been trying to force together, it was the two parts of 
myself, Edward’s Bella and Jacob’s Bella. But they 
could not exist together, and I never should have 
tried. 

I’d done so much damage. 

At some point in the night, I remembered the promise 
I’d made to myself early this morning — that I would 
never make Edward see me shed another tear for 
Jacob Black. The thought brought on a round of 
hysteria which frightened Edward more than the 
653 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




weeping. But it passed, too, when it had run its 
course. 

Edward said little; he just held me on the bed and let 
me ruin his shirt, staining it with salt water. 

It took longer than I thought it would for that smaller, 
broken part of me to cry herself out. It happened, 
though, and I was eventually exhausted enough to 
sleep. Unconsciousness did not bring full relief from 
the pain, just a numbing, dulling ease, like medicine. 
Made it more bearable. But it was still there; I was 
aware of it, even asleep, and that helped me to make 
the adjustments I needed to make. 

The morning brought with it, if not a brighter outlook, 
as least a measure of control, some acceptance. 
Instinctively, I knew that the new tear in my heart 
would always ache. That was just going to be a part of 
me now. Time would make it easier — that’s what 
everyone always said. But I didn’t care if time healed 
me or not, so long as Jacob could get better. Could be 
happy again. 

When I woke up, there was no disorientation. I 
opened my eyes — finally dry — and met his anxious 
gaze. 

“Hey,” I said. My voice was hoarse. I cleared my 
throat. 

He didn’t answer. He watched me, waiting for it to 
start. 

“No, I’m fine,” I promised. “That won’t happen again.” 
His eyes tightened at my words. 



654 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I’m sorry that you had to see that,” I said. “That 
wasn’t fair to you.” 

He put his hands on either side of my face. 

“Bella . . . are you sure? Did you make the right 
choice? I’ve never seen you in so much pain — ” His 
voice broke on the last word. 

But I had known worse pain. 

I touched his lips. “Yes.” 

“I don’t know... .” His brow creased. “If it hurts you so 
much, how can it possibly be the right thing for you?” 

“Edward, I know who I can’t live without.” 

“But ...” 

I shook my head. “You don’t understand. You may be 
brave enough or strong enough to live without me, if 
that’s what’s best. But I could never be that self- 
sacrificing. I have to be with you. It’s the only way I 
can live.” 

He still looked dubious. I should never have let him 
stay with me last night. But I had needed him so 
much... . 

“Hand me that book, will you?” I asked, pointing over 
his shoulder. 

His eyebrows pulled together in confusion, but he 
gave it to me quickly. 

“This again?” he asked. 



655 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“I just wanted to find this one part I remembered ... to 
see how she said it... .” I flipped through the book, 
finding the page I wanted easily. The corner was dog- 
eared from the many times I’d stopped here. “Cathy’s 
a monster, but there were a few things she got right,” 

I muttered. I read the lines quietly, mostly to myself. 
“‘If all else perished, and he remained, I should still 
continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were 
annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty 
stranger.’” I nodded, again to myself. “I know exactly 
what she means. And I know who I can’t live without.” 

Edward took the book from my hands and flipped it 
across the room — it landed with a light thud on my 
desk. He wrapped his arms around my waist. 

A small smile lit his perfect face, though worry still 
lined his forehead. “Heathcliff had his moments, too,” 
he said. He didn’t need the book to get it word perfect. 
He pulled me closer and whispered in my ear, “‘I 
cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my 
soul!”’ 

“Yes,” I said quietly. “That’s my point.” 

“Bella, I can’t stand for you to be miserable. Maybe 



“No, Edward. I’ve made a real mess of things, and I’m 
going to have to live with that. But I know what I 
want and what I need ... and what I’m going to do 
now.” 

“What are we going to do now?” 

I smiled just a bit at his correction, and then I sighed. 
“We are going to go see Alice.” 



656 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Alice was on the bottom porch step, too hyper to wait 
for us inside. She looked about to break into a 
celebration dance, so excited was she about the news 
she knew I was there to deliver. 

“Thank you, Bella!” she sang as we got out of the 
truck. 

“Hold it, Alice,” I warned her, lifting a hand up to halt 
her glee. “I’ve got a few limitations for you.” 

“I know, I know, I know. I only have until August 
thirteenth at the latest, you have veto power on the 
guest list, and if I go overboard on anything, you’ll 
never speak to me again.” 

“Oh, okay. Well, yeah. You know the rules, then.” 

“Don’t worry, Bella, it will be perfect. Do you want to 
see your dress?” 

I had to take a few deep breaths. Whatever makes her 
happy, I said to myself. 

“Sure.” 

Alice’s smile was smug. 

“Um, Alice,” I said, keeping the casual, unruffled tone 
in my voice. “When did you get me a dress?” 

It probably wasn’t much of a show. Edward squeezed 
my hand. 

Alice led the way inside, heading for the stairs. “These 
things take time, Bella,” Alice explained. Her tone 
seemed ... evasive. “I mean, I wasn’t sure things were 
going to turn out this way, but there was a distinct 
possibility... .” 

657 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“When?” I asked again. 

“Perrine Bruyere has a waiting list, you know,” she 
said, defensive now. “Fabric masterpieces don’t 
happen overnight. If I hadn’t thought ahead, you’d be 
wearing something off the rack!” 

It didn’t look like I was going to get a straight answer. 
“Per — who?” 

“He’s not a major designer, Bella, so there’s no need 
to throw a hissy fit. He’s got promise, though, and he 
specializes in what I needed.” 

“I’m not throwing a fit.” 

“No, you’re not.” She eyed my calm face suspiciously. 
Then, as we walked into her room, she turned on 
Edward. 

“You — out.” 

“Why?” I demanded. 

“Bella,” she groaned. “You know the rules. He’s not 
supposed to see the dress till the day of.” 

I took another deep breath. “It doesn’t matter to me. 
And you know he’s already seen it in your head. But 
if that’s how you want it... .” 

She shoved Edward back out the door. He didn’t even 
look at her — his eyes were on me, wary, afraid to 
leave me alone. 

I nodded, hoping my expression was tranquil enough 
to reassure him. 



Alice shut the door in his face. 

658 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“All right!” she muttered. “C’mon.” 



She grabbed my wrist and towed me to her closet — 
which was bigger than my bedroom — and then 
dragged me to the back corner, where a long white 
garment bag had a rack all to itself. 

She unzipped the bag in one sweeping movement, 
and then slipped it carefully off the hanger. She took 
a step back, holding her hand out to the dress like 
she was a game show hostess. 

“Well?” she asked breathlessly. 

I appraised it for a long moment, playing with her a 
bit. Her expression turned worried. 

“Ah,” I said, and I smiled, letting her relax. “I see.” 

“What do you think?” she demanded. 

It was my Anne of Green Gables vision all over again. 

“It’s perfect, of course. Exactly right. You’re a genius.” 

She grinned. “I know.” 

“Nineteen-eighteen?” I guessed. 

“More or less,” she said, nodding. “Some of it is my 
design, the train, the veil... .” She touched the white 
satin as she spoke. “The lace is vintage. Do you like 
it?” 



“It’s beautiful. It’s just right for him.” 

“But is it just right for you?” she insisted. 



659 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“Yes, I think it is, Alice. I think it’s just what I need. I 
know you’ll do a great job with this ... if you can keep 
yourself in check.” 

She beamed. 

“Can I see your dress?” I asked. 

She blinked, her face blank. 

“Didn’t you order your bridesmaid dress at the same 
time? I wouldn’t want my maid of honor to wear 
something off the rack.” I pretended to wince in 
horror. 

She threw her arms around my waist. “Thank you, 
Bella!” 

“How could you not see that one coming?” I teased, 
kissing her spiky hair. “Some psychic you are!” 

Alice danced back, and her face was bright with fresh 
enthusiasm. “I’ve got so much to do! Go play with 
Edward. I have to get to work.” 

She dashed out of the room, yelling, “Esme!” as she 
disappeared. 

I followed at my own pace. Edward was waiting for me 
in the hallway, leaning against the wood-paneled wall. 

“That was very, very nice of you,” he told me. 

“She seems happy,” I agreed. 

He touched my face; his eyes — too dark, it had been 
so long since he’d left me — searched my expression 
minutely. 



660 | P a g e

“Let’s get out of here,” he suddenly suggested. “Let’s 
go to our meadow.” 

It sounded very appealing. “I guess I don’t have to 
hide out anymore, do I?” 

“No. The danger is behind us.” 

He was quiet, thoughtful, as he ran. The wind blew on 
my face, warmer now that the storm had really 
passed. The clouds covered the sky, the way they 
usually did. 

The meadow was a peaceful, happy place today. 
Patches of summer daisies interrupted the grass with 
splashes of white and yellow. I lay back, ignoring the 
slight dampness of the ground, and looked for 
pictures in the clouds. They were too even, too 
smooth. No pictures, just a soft, gray blanket. 

Edward lay next to me and held my hand. 

“August thirteenth?” he asked casually after a few 
minutes of comfortable silence. 

“That gives me a month till my birthday. I didn’t want 
to cut it too close.” 

He sighed. “Esme is three years older than Carlisle — 
technically. Did you know that?” 

I shook my head. 

“It hasn’t made any difference to them.” 

My voice was serene, a counterpoint to his anxiety. 
“My age is not really that important. Edward, I’m 
ready. I’ve chosen my life — now I want to start living 
it.” 

661 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He stroked my hair. “The guest list veto?” 

“I don’t care really, but I ...” I hesitated, not wanting 
to explain this one. Best to get it over with. “I’m not 
sure if Alice would feel the need to invite ... a few 
werewolves. I don’t know if ... Jake would feel like ... 
like he should come. Like that’s the right thing to do, 
or that I’d get my feelings hurt if he didn’t. He 
shouldn’t have to go through that.” 

Edward was quiet for a minute. I stared at the tips of 
the treetops, almost black against the light gray of the 
sky. 

Suddenly, Edward grabbed me around the waist and 
pulled me onto his chest. 

“Tell me why you’re doing this, Bella. Why did you 
decide, now, to give Alice free reign?” 

I repeated for him the conversation I had with Charlie 
last night before I’d gone to see Jacob. 

“It wouldn’t be fair to keep Charlie out of this,” I 
concluded. “And that means Renee and Phil. I might 
as well let Alice have her fun, too. Maybe it will make 
the whole thing easier for Charlie if he gets his proper 
goodbye. Even if he thinks it’s much too early, I 
wouldn’t want to cheat him out of the chance to walk 
me down the aisle.” I grimaced at the words, then 
took another deep breath. “At least my mom and dad 
and my friends will know the best part of my choice, 
the most I’m allowed to tell them. They’ll know I chose 
you, and they’ll know we’re together. They’ll know I’m 
happy, wherever I am. I think that’s the best I can do 
for them.” 

Edward held my face, searching it for a brief time.

“Deal’s off,” he said abruptly. 

“What?” I gasped. “You’re backing out? No!” 

“I’m not backing out, Bella. I’ll still keep my side of 
the bargain. But you’re off the hook. Whatever you 
want, no strings attached.” 

“Why?” 

“Bella, I see what you’re doing. You’re trying to make 
everyone else happy. And I don’t care about anyone 
else’s feelings. I only need you to be happy. Don’t 
worry about breaking the news to Alice. I’ll take care 
of it. I promise she won’t make you feel guilty.” 

“But I — ” 

“No. We’re doing this your way. Because my way 
doesn’t work. I call you stubborn, but look at what 
I’ve done. I’ve clung with such idiotic obstinacy to my 
idea of what’s best for you, though it’s only hurt you. 
Hurt you so deeply, time and time again. I don’t trust 
myself anymore. You can have happiness your way. 
My way is always wrong. So.” He shifted under me, 
squaring his shoulders. “We’re doing it your way, 

Bella. Tonight. Today. The sooner the better. I’ll speak 
to Carlisle. I was thinking that maybe if we gave you 
enough morphine, it wouldn’t be so bad. It’s worth a 
try.” He gritted his teeth. 

“Edward, no — ” 

He put his finger to my lips. “Don’t worry, Bella, love. 

I haven’t forgotten the rest of your demands.” 

His hands were in my hair, his lips moving softly — 
but very seriously — against mine, before I realized 
what he was saying. What he was doing. 

663 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




There wasn’t much time to act. If I waited too long, I 
wouldn’t be able to remember why I needed to stop 
him. Already, I couldn’t breathe right. My hands were 
gripping his arms, pulling myself tighter to him, my 
mouth glued to his and answering every unspoken 
question his asked. 

I tried to clear my head, to find a way to speak. 

He rolled gently, pressing me into the cool grass. 

Oh, never mind! my less noble side exulted. My head 
was full of the sweetness of his breath. 

No, no, no, I argued with myself. I shook my head, 
and his mouth moved to my neck, giving me a chance 
to breathe. 

“Stop, Edward. Wait.” My voice was as weak as my 
will. 

“Why?” he whispered into the hollow of my throat. 

I labored to put some resolve into my tone. “I don’t 
want to do this now.” 

“Don’t you?” he asked, a smile in his voice. He moved 
his lips back to mine and made speaking impossible. 
Heat coursed through my veins, burning where my 
skin touched his. 

I made myself focus. It took a great deal of effort just 
to force my hands to free themselves from his hair, to 
move them to his chest. But I did it. And then I 
shoved against him, trying to push him away. I could 
not succeed alone, but he responded as I knew he 
would. 



664 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




He pulled back a few inches to look at me, and his 
eyes did nothing to help my resolve. They were black 
fire. They smoldered. 

“Why?” he asked again, his voice low and rough. “I 
love you. I want you. Right now.” 

The butterflies in my stomach flooded my throat. He 
took advantage of my speechlessness. 

“Wait, wait,” I tried to say around his lips. 

“Not for me,” he murmured in disagreement. 

“Please?” I gasped. 

He groaned, and pushed himself away from me, 
rolling onto his back again. 

We both lay there for a minute, trying to slow our 
breathing. 

“Tell me why not, Bella,” he demanded. “This had 
better not be about me.” 

Everything in my world was about him. What a silly 
thing to expect. 

“Edward, this is very important to me. I am going to 
do this right.” 

“Who’s definition of right?” 

“Mine.” 

He rolled onto his elbow and stared at me, his 
expression disapproving. 

“How are you going to do this right?” 

665 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I took a deep breath. “Responsibly. Everything in the 
right order. I will not leave Charlie and Renee without 
the best resolution I can give them. I won’t deny Alice 
her fun, if I’m having a wedding anyway. And I will tie 
myself to you in every human way, before I ask you to 
make me immortal. I’m following all the rules, 

Edward. Your soul is far, far too important to me to 
take chances with. You’re not going to budge me on 
this.” 

“I’ll bet I could,” he murmured, his eyes burning 
again. 

“But you wouldn’t,” I said, trying to keep my voice 
level. “Not knowing that this is what I really need.” 

“You don’t fight fair,” he accused. 

I grinned at him. “Never said I did.” 

He smiled back, wistful. “If you change your mind ...” 

“You’ll be the first to know,” I promised. 

The rain started to drip through the clouds just then, 
a few scattered drops that made faint thuds as they 
struck the grass. 

I glowered at the sky. 

“I’ll get you home.” He brushed the tiny beads of 
water from my cheeks. 

“Rain’s not the problem,” I grumbled. “It just means 
that it’s time to go do something that will be very 
unpleasant and possibly even highly dangerous.” 

His eyes widened in alarm.

Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“It’s a good thing you’re bulletproof.” I sighed. “I’m 
going to need that ring. It’s time to tell Charlie.” 

He laughed at the expression on my face. “Highly 
dangerous,” he agreed. He laughed again and then 
reached into the pocket of his jeans. “But as least 
there’s no need for a side trip.” 

He once again slid my ring into place on the third 
finger of my left hand. 

Where it would stay — conceivably for the rest of 
eternity.

CHOICE 



“Jacob, do you think this is going to take too much 
longer?” Leah demanded. Impatient. Whiney. 

My teeth clenched together. 

Like anyone in the pack, Leah knew everything. She 
knew why I came here — to the very edge of the earth 
and sky and sea. To be alone. She knew that this was 
all I wanted. Just to be alone. 

But Leah was going to force her company on me, 
anyway. 

Besides being crazy annoyed, I did feel smug for a 
brief second. Because I didn’t even have to think 
about controlling my temper. It was easy now, 
something I just did, natural. The red haze didn’t 
wash over my eyes. The heat didn’t shiver down my 
spine. My voice was calm when I answered. 

“Jump off a cliff, Leah.” I pointed to the one at my 
feet. 

“Really, kid.” She ignored me, throwing herself into a 
sprawl on the ground next to me. “You have no idea 
how hard this is for me.” 

“For you?” It took me a minute to believe she was 
serious. “You have to be the most self-absorbed 
person alive, Leah. I’d hate to shatter the dream world 
you live in — the one where the sun is orbiting the 
place where you stand — so I won’t tell you how little 
I care what your problem is. Go. Away.” 



668 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 



“Just look at this from my perspective for a minute, 
okay?” she continued as if I hadn’t said anything. 

If she was trying to break my mood, it worked. I 
started laughing. The sound hurt in strange ways. 

“Stop snorting and pay attention,” she snapped. 

“If I pretend to listen, will you leave?” I asked, 
glancing over at the permanent scowl on her face. I 
wasn’t sure if she had any other expressions 
anymore. 

I remembered back to when I used to think that Leah 
was pretty, maybe even beautiful. That was a long 
time ago. No one thought of her that way now. Except 
for Sam. He was never going to forgive himself. Like it 
was his fault that she’d turned into this bitter harpy. 

Her scowl heated up, as if she could guess what I was 
thinking. Probably could. 

“This is making me sick, Jacob. Can you imagine 
what this feels like to me? I don’t even like Bella 
Swan. And you’ve got me grieving over this leech-lover 
like I’m in love with her, too. Can you see where that 
might be a little confusing? I dreamed about kissing 
her last night! What the hell am I supposed to do with 
that?” 

“Do I care?” 

“I can’t stand being in your head anymore! Get over 
her already! She’s going to marry that thing. He’s 
going to try to change her into one of them! Time to 
move on, boy.” 

“Shut up,” I growled. 



669 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




It would be wrong to strike back. I knew that. I was 
biting my tongue. But she’d be sorry if she didn’t walk 
away. Now. 

“He’ll probably just kill her anyway,” Leah said. 
Sneering. “All the stories say that happens more often 
than not. Maybe a funeral will be better closure than 
a wedding. Ha.” 

This time I had to work. I closed my eyes and fought 
the hot taste in my mouth. I pushed and shoved 
against the slide of fire down my back, wrestling to 
keep my shape together while my body tried to shake 
apart. 

When I was in control again, I glowered at her. She 
was watching my hands as the tremors slowed. 
Smiling. 

Some joke. 

“If you’re upset about gender confusion, Leah ... ,” I 
said. Slow, emphasizing each word. “How do you 
think the rest of us like looking at Sam through your 
eyes? It’s bad enough that Emily has to deal with 
your fixation. She doesn’t need us guys panting after 
him, too.” 

Pissed as I was, I still felt guilty when I watched the 
spasm of pain shoot across her face. 

She scrambled to her feet — pausing only to spit in 
my direction — and ran for the trees, vibrating like a 
tuning fork. 

I laughed darkly. “You missed.” 



670 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




Sam was going to give me hell for that, but it was 
worth it. Leah wouldn’t bug me anymore. And I’d do it 
again if I had the chance. 

Because her words were still there, scratching 
themselves into my brain, the pain of it so strong that 
I could hardly breathe. 

It didn’t matter so much that Bella’d chosen someone 
else over me. That agony was nothing at all. That 
agony I could live with for the rest of my stupid, too 
long, stretched-out life. 

But it did matter that she was giving up everything — 
that she was letting her heart stop and her skin ice 
over and her mind twist into some crystallized 
predator’s head. A monster. A stranger. 

I would have thought there was nothing worse than 
that, nothing more painful in the whole world. 

But, if he killed her . . . 

Again, I had to fight the rage. Maybe, if not for Leah, 
it would be good to let the heat change me into a 
creature who could deal with it better. A creature with 
instincts so much stronger than human emotions. An 
animal who couldn’t feel pain in the same way. A 
different pain. Some variety, at least. But Leah was 
running now, and I didn’t want to share her thoughts. 
I cussed her under my breath for taking away that 
escape, too. 

My hands were shaking in spite of me. What shook 
them? Anger? Agony? I wasn’t sure what I was 
fighting now. 



671 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




I had to believe that Bella would survive. But that 
required trust — a trust I didn’t want to feel, a trust 
in that bloodsucker’s ability to keep her alive. 

She would be different, and I wondered how that 
would affect me. Would it be the same as if she had 
died, to see her standing there like a stone? Like ice? 
When her scent burned in my nostrils and triggered 
the instinct to rip, to tear ... How would that be? 

Could I want to kill her? Could I not want to kill one 
of them? 

I watched the swells roll toward the beach. They 
disappeared from sight under the edge of the cliff, but 
I heard them beat against the sand. I watched them 
until it was late, long after dark. 

Going home was probably a bad idea. But I was 
hungry, and I couldn’t think of another plan. 

I made a face as I pulled my arm through the retarded 
sling and grabbed my crutches. If only Charlie hadn’t 
seen me that day and spread the word of my 
“motorcycle accident.” Stupid props. I hated them. 

Going hungry started to look better when I walked in 
the house and got a look at my dad’s face. He had 
something on his mind. It was easy to tell — he 
always overdid it. Acted all casual. 

He also talked too much. He was rambling about his 
day before I could get to the table. He never jabbered 
like this unless there was something that he didn’t 
want to say. I ignored him as best I could, 
concentrating on the food. The faster I choked it down 



"... and Sue stopped by today.” My dad’s voice was 
loud. Hard to ignore. As always. “Amazing woman. 

672 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




She’s tougher than grizzlies, that one. I don’t know 
how she deals with that daughter of hers, though. 

Now Sue, she would have made one hell of a wolf. 
Leah’s more of a wolverine.” He chuckled at his own 
joke. 

He waited briefly for my response, but didn’t seem to 
see my blank, bored-out-of-my-mind expression. Most 
days that bugged him. I wished he would shut up 
about Leah. I was trying not to think about her. 

“Seth’s a lot easier. Of course, you were easier than 
your sisters, too, until ... well, you have more to deal 
with than they did.” 

I sighed, long and deep, and stared out the window. 

Billy was quiet for a second too long. “We got a letter 
today.” 

I could tell that this was the subject he’d been 
avoiding. 

“A letter?” 

“A ... wedding invitation.” 

Every muscle in my body locked into place. A feather 
of heat seemed to brush down my back. I held onto 
the table to keep my hands steady. 

Billy went on like he hadn’t noticed. “There’s a note 
inside that’s addressed to you. I didn’t read it.” 

He pulled a thick ivory envelope from where it was 
wedged between his leg and the side of his 
wheelchair. He laid it on the table between us. 



673 | P a g e 



Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




“You probably don’t need to read it. Doesn’t really 
matter what it says.” 

Stupid reverse psychology. I yanked the envelope off 
the table. 

It was some heavy, stiff paper. Expensive. Too fancy 
for Forks. The card inside was the same, too done-up 
and formal. Bella’d had nothing to do with this. There 
was no sign of her personal taste in the layers of see- 
through, petal-printed pages. I’d bet she didn’t like it 
at all. I didn’t read the words, not even to see the 
date. I didn’t care. 

There was a piece of the thick ivory paper folded in 
half with my name handwritten in black ink on the 
back. I didn’t recognize the handwriting, but it was as 
fancy as the rest of it. For half a second, I wondered if 
the bloodsucker was into gloating. 

I flipped it open.

“Jake, we only have the one table,” Billy said. He was 
staring at my left hand. 

My fingers were clamped down on the wood hard 
enough that it really was in danger. I loosened them 
one by one, concentrating on that action alone, and 
then clenched my hands together so I couldn’t break 
anything. 

“Yeah, doesn’t matter anyway, ” Billy muttered. 

I got up from the table, shrugging out of my t-shirt as 
I stood. Hopefully Leah had gone home by now. 

“Not too late,” Billy mumbled as I punched the front 
door out of my way. 

I was running before I hit the trees, my clothes strewn 
out behind me like a trail of crumbs — as if I wanted 
to find my way back. It was almost too easy now to 
phase. I didn’t have to think. My body already knew 
where I was going and, before I asked it to, it gave me 
what I wanted. 

I had four legs now, and I was flying. 

The trees blurred into a sea of black flowing around 
me. My muscles bunched and released in an effortless 
rhythm. I could run like this for days and I would not 
be tired. Maybe, this time, I wouldn’t stop. 

But I wasn’t alone. 

So sorry, Embry whispered in my head. 

I could see through his eyes. He was far away, to the 
north, but he had wheeled around and was racing to 
join me. I growled and pushed myself faster. 



675 | P a g e

Wait for us, Quil complained. He was closer, just 
starting out from the village. 

Leave me alone, I snarled. 

I could feel their worry in my head, try hard as I 
might to drown it in the sound of the wind and the 
forest. This was what I hated most — seeing myself 
through their eyes, worse now that their eyes were 
full of pity. They saw the hate, but they kept running 
after me. 

A new voice sounded in my head. 

Let him go. Sam’s thought was soft, but still an order. 
Embry and Quil slowed to a walk. 

If only I could stop hearing, stop seeing what they 
saw. My head was so crowded, but the only way to be 
alone again was to be human, and I couldn’t stand 
the pain. 

Phase back, Sam directed them. I’ll pick you up, 
Embry. 

First one, then another awareness faded into silence. 
Only Sam was left. 

Thank you, I managed to think. 

Come home when you can. The words were faint, 
trailing off into blank emptiness as he left, too. And I 
was alone. 

So much better. Now I could hear the faint rustle of 
the matted leaves beneath my toenails, the whisper of 
an owl’s wings above me, the ocean — far, far in the 
west — moaning against the beach. Hear this, and 
nothing more. Feel nothing but speed, nothing but 
676 | P a g e Eclipse - Stephanie Meyer 




the pull of muscle, sinew, and bone, working together 
in harmony as the miles disappeared behind me. 

If the silence in my head lasted, I would never go 
back. I wouldn’t be the first one to choose this form 
over the other. Maybe, if I ran far enough away, I 
would never have to hear again... . 

I pushed my legs faster, letting Jacob Black disappear 
behind me.
